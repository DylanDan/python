Welcome to the VF Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Joe Alkire. Please go ahead, sir.", "Joe Alkire", "Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be in adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.", "You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.", "During the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.", "During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Contemporary Brands businesses as held for sale, and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.", "Joining me on today's call will be VF's President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. The pace of change in both our industry and the broader consumer landscape continues to happen at accelerated rate. 2017 is the year of making transformational moves as we begin to evolve VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric in everything we do.", "Six months into the first year of our 2021 strategy, our results are right in line with our expectations, and in fact, we\u2019re doing so much better than we anticipated. Our improved performance in the face of an unpredictable retail environment around the world demonstrates the strength of our brand portfolio and diversified value creation model. We're in the early phases of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization and we are encouraged by our strong start to 2017.", "During the second quarter, revenue increased 3% which was slightly ahead of our expectations as core growth engines continued to accelerate. Our big three brands, Vans, The North Face and Timberland, grew at a combined rate of 7%. Our international business grew 6%, including 18% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer grew 14% and our digital business was up more than 35% and growth accelerated to 8% in Workwear.", "Our digital wholesale accounts, a key growth driver for VF over the next five years also increased at a high single-digit rate through the first half of 2017. Gross margin improved 160 basis points, an exceptional performance which again exceeded our expectations. ", "VF's brands are strong. We remain disciplined in our renewed focus on elevating our creative capabilities, specifically in product design to enrich consumers brand experience, coupled with stronger marketplace management, is driving more profitable growth and further strengthening our brand equity.", "EPS was $0.29 in the quarter at the high-end of the range we guided to in April. We also repurchased an incremental $200 million of stock which when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash returns to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. Strengthening total shareholder return remains a top priority.", "As we look to the second half of 2017, we are gaining momentum across key dimensions of our business, and we see several catalysts on the horizon to ignite accelerated growth and value creation in our core growth engines.", "As a result, we are raising our full-year 2017 revenue outlook to $11.65 billion based on stronger-than-expected growth in our Outdoor & Action sports business most notably Vans and The North Face brands, D2C and Workwear.", "Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter we are raising our gross margin guidance now to 49.8%. Our strong gross margin performance is a central element of our diversified value creation model. It provides us the flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.", "In light of our increased revenue growth in gross margin expectations, we are investing an additional $40 million or $0.08 per share in 2017 to amplify our momentum and fuel accelerated growth as we move into 2018. Our 2017 EPS outlook is now $2.94, which reflects the high-end of our previous outlook and includes the incremental investment just mentioned.", "Earlier this year, I said that VF is a value creation company and some wondered what that meant. This quarter's results begin to provide evidence of our commitment to value creation. We're in the business of creating catalysts through our strong portfolio of diverse global brands. We will continue to reshape our portfolio and accelerate growth, and while we expect the retail landscape to remain uncertain, we will invest against our largest growth opportunities to create momentum rather than wait for it.", "With that, let's review our second quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands, Workwear and Sportswear. Starting with The North Face brand. Global revenue increased 6% driven by a 26% increase in Europe, and a 1% growth in both the Americas and Asia.", "Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong results from our D2C business, which increased at a mid-teen rate. Wholesale was relatively flat for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas, which didn't really start to impact us into the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North face increased at a high single-digit rate.", "For the first half of 2017, global revenue for The North Face increased 7% or 9% excluding the impact of bankruptcies just mentioned. By region, revenue growth in the Americas was driven by mid-teen growth in D2C with strong results from digital, which grew more than 40% in the quarter. This was partially offset by a high single-digit decrease in wholesale due in large part to the impact of bankruptcies. ", "Turning to product performance. The success of the Apex Flex jacket continued with Outside magazine naming it one of the best summer jackets of 2017.", "And we can't forget to mention The North Face Athlete Alex Honnold, who made climbing history when he completed the first free-solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. I\u2019m not if sure everyone can appreciate just how remarkable the steep was. A 3,000 foot granite wall in less than four hours, climbing alone and without safety gear with only his shoes, shorts, and chalk bag. The mental and physical strength required are beyond comprehension. Alex your passion encouraged, an inspiration to us all. Thank you for being the perfect embodiment of The North Face spirit of exploration.", "In Europe, consumer demand for North Face brand remains very strong across the region. Our wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 40% and D2C grew at a high single-digit rate. The brand has tremendous momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Based on the forward-looking visibility we have into our order books as well as broad-based strength across key product categories in markets, we expect more than 15% growth for the balance of 2017.", "In Asia, second quarter revenue sequentially improved as high teen growth in D2C was partially offset by an expected high teen decline in wholesale. From a product standpoint, outdoor training launched on April 1 with more than 40% sell-through, supported by the I Train For marketing campaign across the region and the opening of the first global outdoor training station in Shanghai.", "Our urban exploration territory also continues to perform very well in Asia, providing consumers an opportunity to experience the brand new use occasions. While the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, and we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace, we expect accelerated growth in the second half of 2017, including mid single-digit growth in the third quarter.", "There is no change to our mid single-digit growth expectation for The North Face brand in 2017. That being said, based on our strong first half performance, current order book visibility, and increased confidence for the balance of the year, we now expect growth to be at the higher end of that mid single-digit range.", "Regarding the shape of our second half performance, fewer off-price sales and a significant shift in the timing of our order books from September to October, which Scott will touch on later, will likely result in a mid single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. Normalizing for the timing shift, however, revenue growth for the third quarter would be in the low to mid single-digit range.", "Now to our largest and fastest-growing brand, Vans. Global revenue was up 9% with 7% growth in the Americas, 5% growth in Europe, and 29% growth in Asia. From a channel perspective, D2C increased more than 25% with 45% growth in our digital business. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate.", "In the Americas, our D2C business remained strong with more than 20% growth in the quarter, including over 25% growth in digital and high teen comp growth. Wholesale declined at a mid single-digit rate pressured primarily by conditions in the family channel where we are in the midst of a product transition and up against strong distribution gains a year-ago. Based on current visibility as well as a significant momentum we have in the business, we now expect low double-digit growth in the Americas in 2017.", "Vans brand growth extends across multiple product categories and families. While the Old Skool has recently become the number one classic style, the iconic slip on and checkerboard styles and designs are seeing tremendous growth, up more than 65% in the quarter, targeting the core skate community, the new athlete inspired UltraRange Pro was recently launched and at a $90 price point, saw real strength in the market with more than 70% sell-through in skate and board sport accounts.", "Vans product collaborations have always been incredibly popular with consumers and the [indiscernible] Co-Lab was no exception. And last, but not least, our powerful customs platform which blends the experiential with the transactional increased at a triple digit rate and is the only -- and is only beginning to tap its full potential in the market as we add functionality each month.", "In Europe, the Vans business is performing better than expected, as demand continues to accelerate. Our D2C performance was exceptional with more than 20% growth driven by more than 40% increase in digital and 20% comp growth. In line with the expectations, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate due to the timing of shipments.", "Based on stronger-than-expected second half orders, we now expect our Vans Europe business to increase at a low double-digit rate for 2017, including strong high teen growth in the second half of this year.", "In Asia, our Vans business is firing on all cylinders delivering almost 30% growth, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth in the region. Results during the quarter were powered by 45% growth in D2C with strength across all markets, including almost 80% growth in digital, in China.", "Looking to our outlook for 2017, we now expect global revenue growth for Vans to be at the high-end of our low double-digit growth range. As expected, Timberland return to growth in the second quarter as global revenue increased 3% in line with our low single-digit growth outlook for the year. Growth was nicely balanced with a mid single-digit increase in D2C, and a low single-digit increase in wholesale.", "Timberland brand revenue in the Americas increased 4% with high single-digit growth in D2C, including 25% growth in digital and low single-digit growth in wholesale. Our non-classics business increased at a low double-digit rate during the quarter with more than 100% growth in our new platforms, including SensorFlex and AeroCore.", "Our Timberland PRO business also remained very strong with more than 20% growth. Our growth strategy is gaining traction as we work to diversify in North America business toward a more balanced assortment. The strong sell-through we are seeing with our non-classics products gives us confidence, we can drive accelerated growth in the second half of 2017 and into next year.", "In Europe, Timberland brand revenue was up 4% in the second quarter driven by low double-digit growth in D2C, partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale. Growth across the region is strong and broad-based with more than 35% growth in our new platforms such as SensorFlex and AeroCore and high single-digit growth in apparel. Our European business has good momentum and is expected to deliver high single-digit growth in the second half of 2017.", "Timberland's Asia business improved sequentially, but was down 1% as D2C declined at a low single-digit rate and wholesale was in line with last year. High single-digit comp growth, including more than 50% growth in digital revenue was offset by our strategic decision to close underperforming doors in some of our more mature markets. At the same time, our new footwear plus D2C concept is performing well across the region and we continue to achieve scale and significant momentum in China as revenue increased an impressive 60%.", "Regarding the shape of our second half performance similar to The North Face brand, a significant shift in the timing of our order books will likely result in a low single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. However, when normalizing for the timing shift, revenue growth for the third quarter will likely be in the low single-digit range. There's no change to our low single-digit growth outlook for Timberland brand in 2017.", "Moving to the Wrangler brand, as expected, global revenue for the second quarter was down 2%. D2C increased at a low double-digit rate, but was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas declined 2%, while revenue in Europe increased 5% and Asia which represents less than 3% of global brand revenue declined at a low double-digit rate for the quarter, primarily because of the continuing demand weakness in India primarily related to fiscal policy changes.", "As we outlined in April, our U.S business continues to be impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and channel consolidation. And while our forward visibility remains low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is difficult to predict, we do believe we're on track to return to moderate growth in the second half of this year, most notably in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re seeing strong growth with our digital wholesale partners and in our own wrangler.com business.", "Our efforts to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail are showing early signs of success. From a product perspective, the 70th anniversary Retro Glory collection continues to attract new and existing consumers with strong sell-through globally, and to wrap up the Wrangler brand, our outdoor line is performing very well.", "Now to the Lee brand. Revenue declined 6% with 25% growth in D2C offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was down 9%, as ongoing channel weakness and consolidations, as well as difficult market conditions in our women's product more than offset solid performance in our men's business. Xtreme Comfort khakis and Extreme Motion Denim are clearly resonating with the male Lee consumer.", "Lee Europe was down 4%, as low single-digit growth in D2C was offset by a mid single-digit decline in wholesale. In Asia, revenue declined slightly as mid single-digit growth in China was offset by ongoing weakness in India. Our women's business in China increased at a double-digit rate powered by our BODY OPTIX and Jade Fusion innovations, which should drive improved performance in the second half of 2017.", "Turning now to Imagewear. Revenue was up 12% in the quarter due in part to LSG jersey sales. As part of the transition agreement with Fanatics, which acquired our licensing business early this year, we will supply jerseys for one-year following the transaction.", "Excluding the impact of LSG jersey revenue, our Image business was up 2% and consistent with our growing optimism about our Workwear platform, which includes our Image business as well as our Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS workwear, revenue growth accelerated to 8% in the quarter with at least 20% growth in three of our largest brands, Timberland PRO, Bulwark, and Wrangler RIGGS workwear.", "We are very bullish on the Workwear space and are clearly advantaged owner in our highest return on capital business. In addition to the macro tailwinds we see forming, we have a unique opportunity to drive accelerated growth and value creation in a highly fragmented market. We will accelerate growth by leveraging our expertise, capabilities, and platforms with some of the strongest brands in the sector.", "With this solid performance and favorable outlook, we now expect Image revenue to increase at a mid single-digit rate in 2017, excluding the LSG jersey business and up from our previous estimate of a low single-digit rate increase.", "Looking at Sportswear. Revenue is showing signs of stabilization and profit has improved. Congratulations to our new management team, which is beginning to make progress in a difficult environment.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.", "A - Scott A. Roe", "Thanks, Steve. Our second quarter results were right in line with our expectations and came in at the high-end of the range we communicated back in April. Revenue growth accelerated to 3% during the quarter, driven by strong results from our core growth engines. Our big three brands were up 7% on a combined basis, led by strength in Vans and The North Face brands, which grew 9% and 6%, respectively.", "As expected, Timberland delivered 3% growth in the quarter and our Workwear businesses increased 8% collectively, with Timberland PRO, Bulwark and Wrangler RIGGS, all achieving at least 20% growth.", "Our international business grew 6% with consistent growth across all three regions. China remains our fastest-growing market, generating 18% growth and we were particularly encouraged to see that our direct-to-consumer business was up 14% including more than 35% growth in our digital business. That's even more impressive when you consider that our store count is down from the prior quarter and our growth rate accelerated.", "Our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved high teen D2C growth during the quarter. Our D2C business has significant momentum as we head into the second half of the year, but more on that in a minute.", "Consistent with our expectations, wholesale revenue declined 2% primarily due to the channel pressures in our Jeanswear North American business, which as -- which we previously discussed. International delivered low single-digit growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a high single-digit rate through the first half.", "Gross margin remained strong at 49.7%, up 80 basis points which includes an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. That is 160 basis point increase currency neutral and better than our prior expectations.", "As we discussed, we remain sharply focused on fundamentals even at the expense of a little bit of revenue growth in the near-term. First half gross margins of 49.9% were up 180 basis points currency neutral. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of the diversified value creation model that provides us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.", "SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 210 basis points to 42.6% in the quarter. To address a question likely on your mind, let me take a few minutes and provide more context around the shape of our expense and investment profile this year. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the lowest volume quarter of the year, so our SG&A ratios are always a little distorted.", "While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we are making deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities, D2C and in particular digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, through the first half, our investment in these areas account for more than all of the SG&A increase versus last year, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.", "As we told you in Boston, at our Investor Day, we\u2019ve made the strategic decision in 2017 to begin investing now rather than wait for our anticipated growth acceleration in the second half. In fact, we've committed an additional $40 million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year. Our investments will accelerate growth as we move into 2018 and it's to our advantage to move quickly and take the offensive [ph].", "Our brands are strong and in a marketplace that continues to experience significant disruption, we believe we have a unique investment and growth opportunity when many of our competitors are on their heels. So putting this all together, this means that we expect SG&A to deleverage through the first three quarters of this year. As our growth accelerates in the fourth quarter and we began to realize the benefit of our agility and cost optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in SG&A in the second half and into 2018.", "Second quarter operating margin declined 130 basis points to 7.1% including a 70 basis point negative impact from changes in FX, as well as the growth investments just mentioned. So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS of $0.29 was in line with prior-year on a currency neutral basis.", "Turning to the balance sheet, our inventory increased 3% slightly less than our second half growth expectation. During the quarter, we repurchased about $760 million of stock bringing our total share repurchase to 1.2 billion so far this year. That's $200 million higher than our previous expectation and when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash return to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. That\u2019s an 8% cash flow yield based on our current market cap.", "The first half was in line with or slightly better than we expected, based on the momentum we have in our business and the additional investments we're making to fuel accelerated growth, we are raising our outlook for the full-year.", "Our updated 2017 outlook now includes the following: reported revenue is expected to be up 2% or 3% on a currency neutral basis to $11.65 billion. This compares to our previous expectation of low single-digit increase. Our increased revenue outlook is driven by strength in Outdoor & Action Sports, particularly Vans and The North Face, increased expectation for D2C most notably digital and higher growth from our Workwear businesses.", "Gross margin is now expected to improve about 40 basis points to 49.8%, which still includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX. This represents a 20 basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of 49.6%. Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis including about a 60 basis point negative impact from changes in FX.", "EPS is now expected to be $2.94, down 1% on a reported basis, but up at a mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. Our outlook now includes $0.08 per share or $40 million pre-tax impact from additional investments to fuel accelerated growth into 2018. As a reminder, our prior EPS outlook was a range of $2.89 to $2.94.", "Now let me provide a few comments regarding the shape of our second half. As it relates to the third quarter, which has historically represented the peak for fall shipments, we\u2019ve seen a significant shift in order book timing from the end of September to early October, simply put as consumers by a closer to need, our key retail partners are setting their floors later which pushes our shipments from what has traditionally been Q3 and to Q4.", "And while we have visibility to the orders, the shift has pushed almost $100 million of wholesale revenue into Q4 compared to a year-ago. As a result, we expect revenue growth in the third quarter to be in the low single-digit range and EPS to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.12. Normalizing for the wholesale timing shift, our revenue and EPS growth rate for Q3 would be in the mid single-digit range.", "Some with the first half behind us, we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have good momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth, our gross margin is strong, our fundamentals are intact, and we are investing in our future growth drivers.", "And as Steve mentioned, given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan, we're putting more investment behind our largest brands and growth platforms and returning more cash to shareholders. We will create momentum, not wait for it.", "If you take away one thing from our comments, I hope that one thing is confidence. Confidence in our outlook, confidence in our brands and our people, and confidence in our strategy.", "I\u2019m going to close by addressing the topic I know is top of mind for many investors, the M&A environment. As you recall, reshaping our portfolio is the number one choice in our 2021 strategy. We are committed to active portfolio management. As we\u2019ve said, we believe we are a value creation company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and the activity has increased over the past few months, and we continue to evaluate the shape of our existing portfolio. We look forward to keeping you updated our progress.", "With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we will open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will have our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.", "Robert Drbul", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Good morning, Bob.", "Scott A. Roe", "Good morning, Bob.", "Robert Drbul", "I guess, the two questions, the first one is more on when you look at the third quarter expectation in some of the detail, on like the order book or the changes in the order book, have there been any material changes to the total number or it's just a shift into the third or the timing of it? And the second question that I have is, around the Jeanswear business, can you just give us an update on the transition its underway? Is there really a site line to stabilization in the Jeanswear business where the profit pressures are pretty significant?", "Scott A. Roe", "So Bob, I will take the first part of that. First of all, our visibility versus what you guys can see is really what we tried to bridge here, right. We -- there is really no change in what we see for the full-year relative to the order books. It's -- we\u2019re just talking about a little bit of a shift in timing. And just to put that in perspective, we are literally talking about a couple weeks. But that's the difference between Q3 and Q4. So, absolutely no change in the big picture. Just a little bit of timing between Q3 and Q4. That's why we tried to zoom out and say if you look at the second half, it's kind of in that mid single-digit range and normalizing, but you\u2019re going to see a little of noise when you compare to last year when you specifically look at just the third quarter.", "Steven E. Rendle", "And Bob your Jeanswear question, really there is little new news and little change to what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The big room -- big picture remains the same, but our visibility is not great and we expect variability as we continue through the year though. We do see a line of sight to an uptick coming back in the fourth quarter. And it's important to remember, in our Jeanswear business our international business continues to be strong, especially in China where we see our Lee women's business continue to grow at double-digit great growth rates behind the two innovations, Body Optix and Jade Fusion. I think once we get through the destocking phase, velocity will increase and that's where I think, we, VF really comes into play and our ability to respond quickly with the strength of our supply chain and the quality of our team that works on that business not to be able to really read and react quickly to be back -- right back in the game.", "Robert Drbul", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. With respect to your cold weather businesses, specifically North Face, but also Timberland, is your view that you\u2019re retail partners have ordered to reasonable end demand for a normal cold-weather season or are we in a stage here where they\u2019re ordering very, very tight and looking to chase, and have you based your orders on what you're pulling in terms of inventory, in terms of their orders, or have you put yourself in a position where you have excess inventory in order to chase into that demand?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes. Hi, Lindsay. This is Steve. I would characterize the outdoor specialty in even more broadly, the Outdoor Community as buying very tight, with -- two years in a row, multi-years where we\u2019ve seen variable winters. Retailers are playing it very close to the best. They\u2019re investing behind those brands, that have momentum and bringing those truly innovative products. Our inventory, we -- as you know, we buy to our order book with a real thoughtful amount of reorder around key styles within each of these brands. I would tell you where the strength sits for us. It's in the performance of our D2C and you saw in this quarter where our comps are strong, our digital is exceptional, and I really would put that behind -- the marketplace is clean. And we're sitting in an environment where -- it's to the rest of the year. We're not -- our ability to chase is limited from a wholesale and probably where if as we see momentum in digital and D2C. That's really our opportunity from -- if strong trends continue. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Got it. And Scott, could you just walk through the drivers of the gross margin improvement in the quarter? I know you talked about FX, but anything specific to channel shift, direct versus wholesale, cost, pricing, etcetera to break down the change that we saw in the quarter would be helpful?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, sure. So there is about 80 basis points of negative impact from FX. I think it was in the prepared remarks. So that means about 160 currency neutral. That mix has been really consistent at that 50 to 60 basis points, and we saw the mix come in through, that's our D2C, digital, international businesses being strong. Remember also we talked in February about the shape of cost, right. So cost through the first half is a tailwind to us. It turns to a little bit of headwind in the second half. For the full-year, it's really not much of a factor. So we're seeing a little bit of benefit now that will turn negative in the second half and -- but really not a huge factor like I said. And then, the other thing is honestly just better fundamentals. We\u2019ve reduced our off-price sales. We\u2019re focused on -- not bringing excess inventory into the channel and we're seeing more full price sell-through along with better D2C and digital. Those things are all pretty virtuous from a gross margin standpoint.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Scott A. Roe", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Michael Binetti, UBS.", "Michael Binetti", "Congrats on a nice quarter. I want to ask you about the $40 million in incremental investment. Obviously, we just went through -- the big five-year outlook with an investment plan there, and so now we\u2019ve got $40 million on top of it. I just want to ask at a high-level, as you think about that, what are some of the areas that you're seeing? Is it more recent stuff that you\u2019ve seen as an opportunity, you decided to dial-up $40 million or is it just extending things from the Analyst Day and then -- obviously, how do you think about the payback on dialing that up, as you\u2019ve already gave an initial plan? How does that $40 million flow-through to your earnings outlook, maybe in the [indiscernible]?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Michael. This is Steve. So, really it's based on our confidence. As we look at where we are year-to-date and what we -- line of sight to what we have for the balance of year, we just have confidence in what we'd like to do, and what we've chosen to do is thoughtfully invest behind a select number of our strategic choices that we outlined in Boston to get us moving into 2018 where we talked about maintaining and building continued momentum. So about a quarter of that $40 million is going against demand creation within our big three brands in D2C and digital. We expect that to have an impact this year and into next year, but half is around specific strategic priorities. Design and innovation, data and analytics, our digital platform, absolutely continuing to move on advanced manufacturing and innovation projects we have in play there and then talent. Talent really is the great driver for us long-term and we are continuing to look at acquiring as well as developing key talent to help us grow long-term.", "Michael Binetti", "Got it. And then, on North Face specifically, I think the one thing we heard coming out of the Analyst Day was, I think we\u2019ve some new leadership there. So maybe there would be some more -- more material update to the strategy after the Analyst Day. I would love to check in on that, how you guys are feeling about innovation for the year and then also just a little bit more on some of the strength you're seeing in Europe? Where is that coming from? It's been several quarters now of very, very big growth above what you see across, I guess, a lot of the channels in Europe from other companies. So I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that business?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, and I would love to talk about that. I think you remember, in Boston, we introduced you to Arne Arens, who at that point had been the leader of our European business and we are moving him to be the GM of the Americas business. He has since been appointed the President of the Global North Face business and just bringing that, that strong leadership presence and vision that he had in Europe to our total global business. And you just really see that in very short order, the confidence, that -- now sits within that broader North Face team, the clarity of focus against their strategy and you\u2019re starting to see the momentum in our D2C business, specifically. I will answer your point on what -- as we think about year and innovation. The Apex Flex jacket, which came out in the spring was a really good beginning to seeing new products move into the marketplace. This fall you're going to see dramatically updated Summit Series collection and there is a jacket in their called the Ventrix, that we're very excited about that not only plays into the Tier 1 aspect of the marketplace, but also into our -- into some of the broader market partners. We also see some new ski lines coming in conjunction with the focus on mountain sports. And then urban exploration, more of that North Face lifestyle presentation that just gets us into a broader set of usage occasions. I think what you see going on in Europe, really is a much tighter focus. If you remember couple of years ago, we went through a reset there as well and Arne led the -- the return to growth through a much, much more focused integrated marketplace management and significant segmentation tailoring and merchandising line, specifically to wholesale partners as well as our own D2C. And as that momentum builds, you\u2019re seeing those results not only in our first half, but in our expectation of getting that mid teen growth through the balance of 2017. So this speaks to the benefit of quality leadership, clarity of vision, and focusing on creating products and brand experiences that consumers can be drawn into.", "Michael Binetti", "I guess, just to follow that really quickly, is -- we can see as it go through your stores, in the U.S now some of the bigger ones starting to get segmented harder between the four different North Face segments. Is the thinking that we can really follow that similar road map has driven such nice growth rates in Europe. In U.S., I guess, as you pull back on some of the wholesale doors, in the U.S., you can -- you still think there is pretty good growth rates ahead for the North Face as you start pushing out similar segmentation strategy here in the D2C side?", "Scott A. Roe", "We absolutely do, Michael. I mean, I think you remember at Boston we talked about a brand that would grow, 6% to 8% on a five-year CAGR. We just raised our guidance this year to the high-end of our mid single, which is at the low-end of that 6% to 8% growth CAGR that we posted for the five-year. So we have great confidence. Just move into these four specific brand territories, just allows our product team and the marketing team to focus on these key usage occasions for our core consumer. Speaking to the core consumer, but also attracting new consumers and you see that in Europe, you see that in Asia, and we have great confidence that that will absolutely work here in the domestic market.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Scott.", "Operator", "We will go next to Camilo Lyon, Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo Lyon", "Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. How are you?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Hey, Camilo.", "Camilo Lyon", "I was hoping you could speak a little bit about your endeavors around accelerating your speed [ph] to market capabilities and where do you see -- which brands you see the most opportunity and that impacting the P&L, first to last I think that\u2019s clearly a function that you guys are working hard to have and already achieved in, but I\u2019m curious to know where your thoughts on how you can really leverage that to your benefit so you can expect more from your D2C goals across the brand?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Right. What we talked a little about this Camilo in Boston, and it's a foundational element of our new five-year strategy. It's one of those key choices around transforming to be more consumer and retail centric. And what we\u2019re looking at there is really the end-to-end process of product creation and everything to do with going to market. We've got a number of projects underway with our largest brands, where we\u2019re really tearing down the timelines of product creation, as well as manufacturing and looking at where can we take time out, how can we use digital technology to advance our ability to be more agile. But it's also true, the integrated marketplace strategy, segmentation, and merchandising very specific collections to the distribution choice and building really well articulated -- well merchandised collections and flowing them in a more relevant and consistent way. So moving away from this old wholesale model, that you\u2019ve seen so many people do over the years to being present more often through more thoughtfully merchandised lines and its challenging every aspect of our product creation cycle. Our supply chain is deeply involved in this project and really helping shepherd how our product creation teams are looking at this, and how they can be more integrated in thoughtful, in improving our speed to market.", "Camilo Lyon", "Does it right to think that North Face maybe the brand that feels the benefits of the first as you layer on the innovation that you\u2019re talking about, [indiscernible] of your four categories and how you\u2019re improving the global process?", "Steven E. Rendle", "The North Face is certainly one of those brands, that\u2019s deep into the work. And I think each one of our big brands will benefit, but to your point specifically yes, The North Face will benefit being -- thinking through the lens of four specific territories, across each of the regions into each of the specific channels. When you can focus on doing fewer things better, the results typically are always very positive.", "Camilo Lyon", "And then, Scott, since you brought it up, I was just curious to get your latest thoughts on if your hunting ground for acquisition has changed or has evolved, I would assume that the discussion, well -- tell me if the discussions have changed to become a little bit more fluid with respect to valuations and if that\u2019s -- if there's been a closer dialog with respect to the [indiscernible] grounds of where buyers and sellers [indiscernible]?", "Scott A. Roe", "Well, I guess, I\u2019d answer it this way, Camilo. One of the nice byproducts of the disruption and carnage in our sector is the fact that valuations are coming a little bit our way and given our strong balance sheet the cash that we generate, that puts us as an advantaged acquirer in the space. So valuation as I try to say is only one component of the equation, right. And it has to be, first of all, the right brand, the right space, and something that we\u2019re an advantaged owner to make it -- make sense. But given that, valuation is always going to be a key component and valuations in general are moving our directions. So I would say it's a slightly more favorable environment compared to say the last 12 the 24 months.", "Camilo Lyon", "And then for your hunting ground, is that -- it used to be, if I recall correctly, you\u2019re focused on the Outdoor & Action Sports face, footwear was a key category that you\u2019ve been looking at, is that evolve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Camilo. This is Steve. I'll take that. If you remember back in Boston, I stated pretty clearly that, I\u2019d really like the external world to not think of us as an Outdoor & Action Sports company, but as a value creation company. That is deeply informed by our understanding of our core consumer, anchored in our powerful brands and certainly a center of gravity sitting in Outdoor & Action Sports, but it's less about really the -- the sector and it's more about the consumer usage occasions. And where can we find a way to bring our skills and capabilities and the benefits of our platforms to bear it to unlock these new pools of value. The number one choice in our integrated strategy is reshaping our portfolio and we are extremely committed to doing just that in aligning our portfolio to be consistent with our financial aspirations.", "Camilo Lyon", "Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.", "Operator", "We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Good morning and congrats on the continued momentum in the business. I want to follow up on the incremental investment. In terms of the $0.08 impact, how should we think about it between 3Q and 4Q? And can we potentially further parse out in basis points the SG&A deleverage anticipated for the third quarter versus the leverage expected for the fourth quarter?", "Scott A. Roe", "Good morning, Laurent. I would expect a question like that as you're building that massive model. The -- we haven't really shaped it, but Steve made a comment and some of that is in the second quarter. You saw some of that incremental investment. We even got going in the second quarter and it's relatively balanced through the third and fourth. This is the way I would answer that. So the -- and from a gross margin standpoint, we've talked to you about the full-year, you know with the first half is, you can assume that's fairly linear through the back half. So I think that gives you the pieces to shape the second half of the year and model it out reasonably well.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Okay. Super helpful. And then a non-modeling question. A number of key vendors like Nike and Ralph Lauren have recently outlined efforts to edit this. Can you count going forward? Your March Investor Day, I think the term editing the portfolio with you several times, so aside from any potential divestitures or acquisitions, are there any internal processes you may be putting in place around [indiscernible] assortment to further drive the gross margin over time?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes. Laurent, that is real key to the transformation project that I answer just a little bit ago. As you think about integrated marketplace and what's the correct number of SKUs in each of the specific deliveries to be agile and relevant to our consumer, editing SKUs to amplify, stronger product is a key part of that. I don't have any specific metrics that I would share with you today, but it is central to how we\u2019re thinking about editing to amplify and becoming much more agile with how we come to market across each of our big brands.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in. Shipping out the $100 million shift from 3Q and 4Q, can we expect the wholesale business to be roughly a flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter, especially as you lap last year's U.S bankruptcies?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, that -- that's a reasonable assumption. You'll see relative -- you will see the strongest wholesale growth for the year in the fourth quarter for the reasons that you mentioned also we are lapping -- we have the bankruptcy impact [indiscernible] and we're also starting to lap the destocking activities in the fourth quarter.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Super helpful. Best of luck.", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, one other thing just to add on that too, don't forget Vans Europe really is returning back to growth. We talked about that order book being in the double-digit range in the second half. So that\u2019s a third factor.", "Operator", "We will have our next question from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning everyone and congratulations on the improved results. As you think of the digital wholesale business and the growth that you\u2019re seeing there, how do you think about your strategy with the Amazon's in the world -- of the world? And then, your thinking about D2C, which seems to have accelerated. What are your plans with store openings and closing in the different regions? Thank you.", "Steven E. Rendle", "So Dana I will start here. So how we -- I think it's more about how do we think about really those the digital wholesale partners that we have across the globe. And there's major pure plays. There's also key customers that we've been with for years and they are part of that integrated marketplace that have choices that we have and they\u2019re very important part. We talked about that in Boston, that our digital wholesale partners is a significant part of our growth in the next five years. Amazon is an important customer. And just we have -- some of our brands that have 1P relationships, we have some brands that have 3P relationships and we have some brands that have chosen to continue to look at and measure just how they could successfully work with Amazon more importantly here in the U.S marketplace long-term. I think it's fair to say, you will see The North Face open up a 3P partnership and have a trial going into fall '17 or you might even want to call that a pilot as we look at how to integrate Amazon into the long-term integrated marketplace strategy for The North Face here in the United States. We are working with Amazon in Europe and we will look at how we can do that here. But I\u2019d remind you there's a number of great players around the globe, AliBaba's, Orlando [ph], all of those are key wholesale partners for us long-term.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you. And on the direct-to-consumer piece on the retail stores part?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, maybe I'll start with a little bit of that. Dana, first of all, good morning. So we talked about the fact that our store count actually was down very modestly versus the last quarter. And that the reason to highlight that is just to pay off the fact that we said we're serious about looking at our portfolio from a profitability standpoint. We're really focused on improving the performance of and editing our underperforming stores and focusing on those formats and brands which are very successful. So you'll see that even if it costs us a little top line, we're willing to be -- we are willing to take those actions and that really is a pay off against that. Having said that, we're really committed to brick-and-mortar stores going forward, because we think that's part of that integrated marketplace that Steve mentioned. That's the highest and 10 ultimate experience of our brands and we see that is a critical component to the overall picture. So we talked about 50 net store openings this year, and you can expect something similar to that going forward according to our long range plan.", "Dana Telsey", "Thank you.", "Steven E. Rendle", "You bet. Thank you, Dana.", "Operator", "We will go next to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.", "Matthew Boss", "Thanks. So on gross margin is it still fair to think about 40 to 50 basis points of underlying expansion from mix just on an annual basis? And if so, can you just walk through the drivers? And then separately on SG&A, I guess, given your comments earlier should we expect expenses to grow below the pace of sales as we move into next year and beyond?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes. So first of all gross margin, yes, you're right in that zone. I mean our mix is a little ahead of our long-term rate. But we\u2019ve said that 40 to 50 basis points should be sustainable and it's pretty simple. Our highest margin businesses are fastest-growing. That's been true and we expect that to continue to be true, that being our international business are our digital and our D2C in general plus Outdoor & Action Sports are big three brands, have higher gross margins in the total. So that mix we expect to continue. I will just remind you of kind of the formula, right. Our gross margins expand, we are investing from an SG&A standpoint in those strategic drivers and then looking for leverage as we talk about platforms across [indiscernible] if looking for leverage and all other expenses. And that\u2019s how this formula works together. So as it relates to SG&A, we will continue to invest in SG&A. Over time that's going to be below our margin expansion. We talked about in our 2021 plan, our operating margin will expand over the next five years. But let's be clear, we are going to continue to invest around as growth drivers particularly D2C and specifically digital underneath that.", "Matthew Boss", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Sam poser, Susquehanna.", "Samuel Poser", "Good. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got a couple. Can you clarify the change in your currency neutral revenue guidance between what you had prior and what you\u2019re giving now?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes. I will start. Hey, Sam. Its Scott. So, yes, we said last time low single-digit currency neutral and reported with 2 points of currency, so that obviously if you do the math, that\u2019s about 1%. And now we're raising that to about 2%, at a $11.65 million. So that's how we get from and to and we've given you a very specific revenue target at $11.6 5 million.", "Samuel Poser", "So your currency impact is the same just you\u2019re raising the numbers?", "Scott A. Roe", "Well, there is some currency benefit. If we think about what's happened in the currency markets, our largest exposure is the euro and it's a little favorable. Our second largest is the pound, which is very unfavorable. But when you net that together, there is some benefit from a currency standpoint, although not significant.", "Samuel Poser", "Okay. And then -- two other just housekeeping. Most of the questions have been answered. The tax rate you\u2019re looking for the full-year and the share count, what's built into the share count for the -- in this guidance?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, so what we -- we don't give you the share count per se, but we talked about $1.2 billion of buybacks, so I guess the math can be done. As it relates to the tax rate, we said about 20%. And that\u2019s consistent with what we said in our last guidance.", "Samuel Poser", "Well, thank you very much and good luck.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thanks, Sam.", "Scott A. Roe", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "We will go next to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy", "Great. Thanks. [Technical difficulty]", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes. Hi, Erinn. Its Steve. So I think what we see going on there, we put a new leadership team in place there in January. Brendan, brought a really strong understanding of retail. One of the areas we wanted to quickly shore up was our outlook business and that's really around productivity and how we're really converting the traffic that comes in our doors. Concurrently with that, we -- last year continue to look at our product offering and evolving that to be -- to allow us in the same idea of integrated marketplace, have -- specific products for each of our different channels of distribution. And I see -- I think what you see happening this year is what we have going on in the department store is relevant to that consumer. It's different than what you have in our outlet stores and online. And I think just with a more focused assortment and in a slightly cleaner marketplace, we're seeing that drop to our profitability as we continue to look to reignite sales. I really don't have a line of sight to what the balance of the year. Otherwise we\u2019re going to continue to do more of the same and bring relevant third and fourth quarter styles through this to the lens of the Nautica heritage, that we've seen working really well. And again just these assortment specific to each of the channels, which is new to some of the things that we've done in the past.", "Erinn Murphy", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Kate McShane, Citi Research.", "Kate McShane", "Thanks for taking my question. With regards to the operating margins for Jeanswear specifically, can you help us understand the mechanics of the operating margin during the quarter and for the rest of the year how much of it has to do with the destocking and how much is Apex related?", "Scott A. Roe", "Sure. I will take it, Kate. Good morning. So first of all, there's a few dynamics that are going on in the profitability. First, regarding margin. We\u2019ve made a strategic decision to put more innovation and more make into the channel as an offensive move. But it's at a time when pricing is difficult. So that has put pressure on our margins in the short-term. We think that's the right move. Remember the big picture here, right. We are going through a disruptive phase, but we're really targeting and focused on when we come out of this, right. We\u2019re trying to position ourselves to be the strongest brand standing at the end of this process. And as a result, we decided from a short-term profitability standpoint we'd make that strategic decision. The other side of that is again we're playing really to win in the long-term. So we've maintained our demand creation investments through this difficult period. We could have easily made a different decision, which would have helped us from a short-term profitability, but we think again for the same reasons the smart move here is to play for the long game and for the endpoint. And so we\u2019re going to see tough margins through this year and really those same drivers that I just mentioned that we're seeing in the first half. You will see those themes continuing into the second half.", "Steven E. Rendle", "And Kate, I would add to that, why we made the decision to maintain our demand creation is we see our specialty business specifically the Western category, Wrangler RIGGS, but also mentioned the 70 Retro Style, as we look to open up the lens of our Wrangler brand and open it up to a broader set of channels. We're seeing really nice traction taking hold in some of these new points of sale in the moving up the distribution channel and we think it's important to continue to invest behind the brand to assure that that continues to go.", "Kate McShane", "Thank you.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Kate.", "Scott A. Roe", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from Jim Duffy, Stifel.", "Jim Duffy", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hope you\u2019re doing well.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Hey, good morning, Jim.", "Jim Duffy", "Couple questions for me. You mentioned that the visibility on the Jeanswear business is difficult. Is the destocking headwind behind you at this point in the Jeanswear category?", "Scott A. Roe", "No, Jim, it's not behind us. It's progressing and just [indiscernible] the shape. The reason we say, we kind of know the endpoint here, right. We know where the floors are going to end up when we say lack of visibility we don't control the pace of markdowns as the floor is cleared, and that can have a really big impact on our sell-through depending on what's on sale, how deep those discounts are etcetera. So the quarter-to-quarter cadence is going to be a little hard for us to project, but when you step back and say there's only so many -- so much inventory in the floor to be cleared and we know where the endpoint is, you kind of know the goalpost, you\u2019re just not sure exactly what happens in between.", "Jim Duffy", "Fair enough. And then building on that, you did a nice job managing the inventories. Can you talk about some of the things you are doing to keep inventory tightened? How it is that you\u2019re better managing the amount of off-price across all the brands, not just specific to Jeanswear?", "Scott A. Roe", "Yes, I guess, I would say it started with the fact that I think from -- we decided to play it a little on the conservative side, right. We didn't build excess inventory. We are -- we gave guidance. It's in the low end of the range and we said we're willing to walk a little bit of revenue in order to improve the dynamics in the marketplace. So we're not building the field of dreams, right. We're not building inventory in a hope that we will get it. We are not -- we are trying to hold back a little bit and match order books closer to the conservative position. And we've seen over time that that type of action will pay off in the long run. It hurts us a little bit in the short-term from the top line and short-term earnings, but for the long-term brand health and long-term growth, history has proven that's the right -- the place we want to be.", "Jim Duffy", "Okay, good. And then my last question. The sales model for some of the other businesses beyond Jeanswear have historically offered better visibility. In the U.S wholesale channel, are your partners giving you a better baseline of visibility to plan the business or you just still feel there's a fair amount of uncertainty as they try to get their arms around their own fundamentals?", "Steven E. Rendle", "You know, Jim, I think -- here in the U.S I think the wholesale community is playing things very, very tight to the West [ph] and rightfully so. The marketplace is transforming and the historical ways of ordering are needing to change and that's really central to how we\u2019re thinking about our transformation agenda, how we're -- being much more diligent around the integrated marketplace understanding our channel partners. What's the space that we have to place product in, what's the frequency required to really be present and incent consumers to come in and interact with us either in our own stores or wholesale. So I think things are tightening up and they should for all of us be, I think, more in tune with what our consumers are asking us for. This notion of transforming is a really important aspect.", "Jim Duffy", "Okay. Thank you very much, guys.", "Steven E. Rendle", "You bet.", "Scott A. Roe", "Okay, Jim.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Steven Rendle for additional or closing remarks.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Great. Yes, thank you everybody. I just want to reiterate, we are in the early stages of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization. And we're encouraged with where we are at the start of 2017, but I would just remind us all that we're at the beginning of this journey. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth. Our gross margins are improving and then our fundamental business disciplines are very, very intact. We are choosing to thoughtfully invest in our future growth and the confidence we have year-to-date has us moving more quickly against our design and innovation agenda, driving demand creation, but also looking at some of the core platforms of advanced analytics, advanced manufacturing, and specifically talent. We are focused on creating momentum against our five year's objectives and we look forward to interacting with you in the future as this -- the strategy unfolds.

And before we dive into a few highlights of the quarter and the year, let's first touch on a non-cash accounting manner. During the past few years, our Contemporary Brands business which represents about 3% of VF\u2019s total revenues has operated in a challenging environment.", "In this morning's release, you saw that we concluded that the carrying value of our 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands has declined. As a result, in the fourth quarter we took an after-tax impairment charge of $307 million which is about $0.70 of EPS to reduce the carrying value of those brand's assets on our books. Bob will take you through more detail on this in a few minutes.", "With that said, on an adjusted or underlying operating performance basis, our fourth quarter results were quite strong and contributed to another fantastic year for VF. For the full year, total revenue grew 8% and reached $12.3 billion led by 13% growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition or up 14% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. Our international business grew 9% or 11% if you adjust for currency. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 19% and included high single-digit comps.", "Our full year gross margin improved by 70 basis points to reach 48.8% all which led to an adjusted earnings per share of $3.08 which is up 14% over last year's $2.71 and it's ahead of our annual long-term earnings growth target. And finally, share buybacks during the year when combined with 22% increase in our quarterly dividend rate returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders.", "Looking forward to 2015, foreign currency, currency adjusted, currency neutral, these are terms you are going to hear us and many U.S. companies with sizable international businesses talk about likely for many quarters to come. And while the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar may continue to cause reported results to shift depending on how the euro, the pound, the peso and yen, move throughout the year, the important news is, our fundamental business is incredibly strong and the momentum we've established will continue.", "In 2015 we're teed up to deliver another year of record financial results for shareholders. For the full year again, on a constant or currency neutral basis, we expect revenues to be up 8% which is in line with our 2017 organic growth rate target. That growth rate is of course an even stronger rate if you factor in the 53rd week we had in 2014 and similar to last year we expect Outdoor & Action Sports, International and our DTC business to remain the most significant drivers of growth.", "We expect gross margin to improve by at least 40 basis points to reach 49.2% including some negative FX headwinds. This puts us just 30 basis points shy of our five-year 2017 goal at the end of only the third year of our five-year plan. Operating margin should reach 15% versus the adjusted operating margin of 2014, once again despite negative currency influences.", "We expect our currency neutral earnings per share to grow 12% versus the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2014. We're also pleased to report that we expect once again to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. That sounds like a lot to deliver and it is, but we are confident we will achieve these goals.", "Let me summarize what has driven and will continue to drive our strong performance. First, we will lead in innovation by increasing our pipeline of compelling new products and technologies. Second, we will deepen connections with consumers by creating consistent and compelling engagements. Third, we will serve consumers directly reaching them across multiple channels wherever and whenever they shop, and finally, we will expand geographically taking advantage of our scale in every region and channel that we operate in.", "So in closing, with year two of our five-year plan in the books and year three looking quite strong ahead of us, I'm happy to say that the performance of our underlying operations is on track with our long-term targets. We have never been more bullish about VF's business. Our company theme is consistent; powerful brands, powerful platforms, one VF.", "And one last thing before I pass the call over to Bob, I'd like to offer a few words about my experience with him on this his last earnings call before his retirement. It has truly been an honor to work with this man. He is my friend and my thought partner and my counsel. He possesses extraordinary talent, intelligence, discipline and unique leadership capabilities.", "During his nearly 30-year tenure at VF he has been undeniably instrumental in the success and complete transformation of our company. He has been an invaluable author of our business playbook and our operational principles and enforcer of financial discipline and honestly he is just a good person. He is a person with the head for success and the heart to succeed and he will truly be missed.", "I can attest that Scott Roe has some big shoes to fill and I have worked with Scott for almost two decades at VF. Scott knows VF. He is battle tested and an extraordinary leader. I have every confidence in him and his ability to make significant contribution as VF's next Chief Financial Officer.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over for the last time to our great friend and the Chief Financial Officer the Wall Street Journal ranked as number eight in the universe, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Shearer.", "Bob Shearer", "Well, thanks Eric for the kind words and also the unique opportunity to serve alongside you throughout much of my time at VF, I just have way, way, way, too many good things to say about VF in my experiences during an earning call, but I will say that I couldn\u2019t be more proud of being part of the incredible transformation this company has successfully put in place. What an honor it's been for me. And I've also enjoyed working with all of you on this call over the years and I'll miss that for sure. But first, I am still the CFO, so back to the business at hand.", "Our fourth quarter results and overall performance in 2014 once again illustrate the strength of the VF business model and how our operational excellence enables us to deliver on our growth objectives year after year. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% led by exceptional results from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition as well as our International and direct-to-consumer businesses.", "For the quarter, foreign currency fluctuations hurt the revenue comparison by about three percentage points while the incremental week that Eric referenced helped by about that same amount. Our gross margin reached a record 49% in the fourth quarter with an 80 basis point improvement driven mostly by the continued shift of the revenues toward our higher margin businesses and a small lift from an accounting change made earlier in the year related to retail concession fees.", "SG&A as a percent of revenues in the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points. This increase was primarily due to that same accounting change as retail concession fees are now included in the SG&A line rather than netted against revenues.", "And now a bit more on the fourth quarter impairment charge we recorded for the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands and our contemporary coalition. As you know, the contemporary space has certainly been a challenged one of late, because of and related to that, we determined that the fair values of these brands were below their respective carrying values. As a result, we recorded $396 million pretax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to these brands which equates to $307 million after-tax or $0.70 of diluted earnings per share.", "So while we continue to view 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss as vehicles for growth from today's levels our projections did not support balance sheet carrying values, hence the charge.", "Now getting back to the P&L, and as discussed in the press release, there were further amounts that exclude the impairment charge I just discussed as adjusted amounts. So adjusted operating income grew 14% and adjusted operating margin was 16.2% compared with 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013, which brings us to the bottom line and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 which is up 20% over last year's quarter. Including the impairment charge fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.28.", "Recapping now on full year basis, revenue growth for the year was 8% which included about one percentage point of negative impact from FX and about one percentage point of benefit in the 53rd week in 2014. This growth was primarily driven by exceptional strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition which was up 13% for the full year or 14% currency neutral. Our international business, which was up 9%, 11% currency neutral and our D2C business which was up 19% included high single-digit comps and more than 30% growth in e-commerce revenues.", "Gross margin improved by 70 basis points. Our gross margin expansion story continues reflecting the continued revenue mixed shift toward higher-margin businesses and our intense focus on this critical measure of our brands' strength. Gross margin expansion has and will continue to be an important part of our financial story. Our highest margin businesses are our fastest growing. In 2014 Outdoor & Action Sports represented nearly 60% of total revenue, international 38% and D2C 26%.", "SG&A as a percentage of total revenue was up 30 basis points and increased to almost completely to the change in concession accounting. In fact, if you look at our underlying operations, we were able to continue to increase the investment in our expanding D2C business and marketing investments while leveraging and maintaining strong cost controls across other areas of the organization. As we've said in the past, expanding gross margins, investing in growth, in D2C and marketing and cost leverage in other areas of SG&A were up, that's our model today and looking forward that will continue to serve us and our shareholders well.", "We also entered the year with our capital structure providing great flexibility. In 2014 we generated nearly $1.7 billion in cash from operations and returned more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and that's almost twice the cash return we delivered in 2013. Inventory levels are in great shape up just 6% at year end and well below the rate of revenue growth and finally our return on invested capital improved to 18.6% up 100 basis points which we're pleased to report is tracking head of our 2017 target.", "So with 2014 behind us, let's talk about the year ahead and I'll start with the fact that we're positioned for another year of outstanding performance across the globe. As you've heard given the size and importance of our expanding international businesses there is some noise in our 2015 outlook related to foreign currency fluctuations mostly related to translating foreign currencies into dollars for reporting. So I'll do my best to sort through the operational side of our business versus expected reported results including the currency implications.", "First, in terms of definitions. I'll refer to currency neutral amounts, which assumes that there will be no foreign currency rate changes from 2014 to 2015. That way you can understand the true operational growth in our businesses and brands. Now as in the past, by far the majority of the currency impacts actually more than 80% result simply from translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. However, in 2015 given the recent and rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly all currencies outside of the U.S. there is some, although limited transactional impact as well.", "For example, most of the impact on the transactional side results from the recent decision of the Swiss Government to move away from pegging their currency to the euro. Because our European businesses are headquartered in Switzerland, that means in U.S. dollars, our reported headquarter expenses increased. The reason these transactional impacts are not more significant is that we have a strong and efficient hedging program that offsets nearly all of these influences, but when currencies move so quickly and/or unexpectedly, well we still covered nearly all, but not quite all of the risk and of course in a more normal currency environment, like we've had over the past number of years, those transactional impacts are just not significant.", "Our European business is by far the most significant of our international operations or exposure to the euro represents our biggest currency challenge. In our outlook for 2015 we have used an assumption of euro 1.13 to dollar relationship and as you know, the euro relationship to the dollar has been quite volatile as have most foreign currencies of late. With perspective around what additional movements of the euro to dollar relationship would mean to our P&L, a $0.05 move in the euro on a full year basis and that's important would have been an impact on the revenues of about $125 million and $0.05 per share on our EPS.", "And that works both ways. In other words, with strengthening and weakening of the dollar of course as we go through the year that impact declines as the total exposure lessens. And keep in mind that other currencies have also devalued against the U.S. dollar similarly to the euro, however, the euro remains our biggest exposure.", "Okay now with that out of the way, move on to 2015 and I'll start at the top with revenues, which we expect to grow 8% on a currency neutral basis, up 3% reported. On a currency neutral basis our plans include growth in every region as well as our wholesale and D2C channels. Now keep in mind that the additional week in 2014 holds back the comparison by about one percentage point.", "All of that implies another strong year of revenue growth for our brands and importantly, we're looking for another year that stays right on track on a currency adjusted basis with our long-term targets as outlined in our 2017 objectives. So leading the way will be our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, which is expected to deliver another great year led by continued strength in VF's biggest brands, The North Face, Vans and Timberland.", "Actually we expect strong growth from most brands within this coalition. We anticipate low double-digit currency neutral growth for the coalition up at a mid single-digit rate reported. On a currency neutral basis, we expect low double-digit growth from the North Face a mid teen increase at Vans and a low teen increase at Timberland, all of which are in line with the annual growth targets we set in our 2017 plan. So another great year in store for outdoor and action sports.", "In Jeanswear we expect a low single-digit revenue increase on a currency neutral basis and improvement over 2014. Reported growth for Jeanswear should show a low single-digit percentage increase.", "We are looking for mid single-digit growth in both our Imagewear and Sportswear coalitions for the full year and finally we're expecting revenues for the Contemporary Brands coalition to be nearly flat, not anticipating any significant trend changes in the Contemporary category.", "We expect the strong momentum in our international and direct-to-consumer businesses to continue in 2015 as well, with international revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit percentage rate currency neutral or low single-digit growth on a reported basis, and by region in Europe our largest international market, we expect high single-digit percentage growth on a currency neutral basis. Reported results in Europe are expected to show a decline by a mid single-digit percentage rate for the full year.", "In our Asia-Pacific region, on both the currency neutral and reported basis we expect revenues to increase at a mid to high teen rate. And lastly, we expect our Americas and that's the non-U.S. business to be up at a mid-teen percentage rate currency neutral or up at a mid-single digit reported rate. Our D2C business which finished 2014 with $3.2 billion in revenues is expected to be up at a mid-teen percentage rate currency neutral or up at a low double digit reported rate. Growth in D2C is expected to be driven by approximately 150 store openings or 125 net of closures and high single-digit comp sales growth including a 30% increase in e-commerce revenues.", "Now turning to margins. In 2015 we expect our gross margin rate to improve by 40 basis points to reach 49.2%. That would bring us to just 30 basis points shy of our 2017 gross margin target with two years to ago and in fact our 49.2% expectation for 2015 includes about 30 basis points of headwinds due to foreign currency rate changes. So from an operational standpoint it says we expect to be on our 2017 numbers a couple of years ahead of target. Independent of foreign currency the expansion in gross margin of 60 to 70 basis points from the favorable mix shift that we've seen for many years remains intact and as always there is no reason that should change going forward.", "Now staying on the gross margin topic for just a minute. I'm pretty sure you have at least a few questions on input costs for 2015. Now let me start by saying that overall the impact of pricing versus product cost on gross margin is about neutral and the impact of each is relatively small. That is the impact of pricing increases and product cost increases are both minimal. Given our ability to improve our gross margins through a favorable mix, we view that as good news.", "There are many components to our gross margin story related to product costs. First, you've all been reading about the cost of cotton coming down. As a reminder we buy finished fabrics like denim. We don't buy cotton, however, the cost of cotton will ultimately impact our cost of cotton based fabrics because of the lag time of cotton flowing through our production cycle it will be the second half of the year when we see a benefit of the cotton cost reduction, primarily in our Jeans business.", "Next up, leather. We generally find it advantageous to lock in our leather buys over a longer-term. Right now we're locked down to the third quarter of 2015. Because of this timing we locked in costs for leather in 2015 is higher than our cost in 2014 even though today's costs have declined somewhat from those higher levels.", "Regarding oil, we don\u2019t buy oil directly, but the cost of oil does impact some of our synthetics and other production costs. We lock in our synthetic costs over an even longer period about a year in advance. Accordingly our costs for synthetics were locked in prior to the recent cost reduction in oil. So the costs in 2015 are about flat with 2014.", "So from a materials costs standpoint all of that nets to about flat costs in 2015 versus 2014. And finally it won't surprise you that labor costs are on the rise, we estimate in our own plans by as much as 3% to 5% and on source products by an average of 10% to 15%. Generally we're able to mitigate much of the higher labor costs in our plants, but not so with external costs. The increase in labor cost is generally the reason for the limited overall product cost increase that I mentioned earlier.", "So there are a lot of puts and takes on product cost for us this year. Our input costs are diverse like our business. Our supply-chain folks do a great job of finding the lowest cost with high quality around the globe. That's a competitive advantage for us for sure as we continue to look for gross margin expansion and 2015 will be no exception.", "All right, so taking a look at SG&A. Overall our model should remain intact. We will continue to invest in our brands and product innovation as well as our growing D2C businesses and leverage our growth against other costs. Foreign currency rate changes will put some pressure on our reported SG&A ratio to revenues like the change in the Swiss franc that I mentioned earlier. However, despite that, our SG&A ratio will remain relatively flat with 2014, bringing us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 15% in 2015 on a reported basis held back by about 30 basis points related to currency changes in both the gross margin and SG&A areas.", "Taking this to the bottom line, we expect our earnings per share on a currency neutral basis to increase 12%, up 4% on a reported basis and keep in mind that the inclusion of the additional week in 2014 holds back this comparison by a couple percentage points. A few other housekeeping items. We're assuming a 24% to 24.5% effective tax rate and capital expenditures of approximately $225 million.", "Now in terms of revenue comparisons throughout the year in 2015, on a currency neutral basis we're expecting relatively consistent growth comparisons. Revenue comparisons on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 will be slightly stronger than the first due to one, the bigger negative currency impacts expected in the first half of 2015 versus the second, meaning foreign currencies were stronger against the U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2014 than the second and two, the seasonality of our overall business waiting through the second half including our expanding D2C businesses.", "With respect to earnings gains in 2015 and this is on a reported basis, that same negative impact from the timing of currency movements of 2015 versus 2014 will mean tougher earnings comparisons in the first half versus the second and especially in the first quarter when foreign currencies in 2014 were at the strongest levels against the U.S. dollar and our international business mix is particularly high.", "Our outlook for cash from operations deserves some discussion. Our outlook of $1.3 billion of cash from ops in 2015 includes two significant factors. First, in early January '15 we contributed $250 million to our pension plan versus only $50 million in 2014. Our pension plan is now fully funded and this is a very efficient use of our cash based on the assumption of earnings on those funds impacting our pension expense and the additional week or the 53rd week in 2014 was a big week for cash receipts, considering that many retailers make their payments on account right after their month-end, which meant we received their cash in our year 2014. That represented over $200 million of incremental cash that would not be expected in 2015.", "And related to how we'll put that cash to use for our shareholders, well our priorities are unchanged. Our first priority of course remains on the acquisition front. Regarding share repurchase is in 2015 we expect to mirror our 2014 spend and buy back about $700 million worth of our stock early in the year. That combined with our annual dividend, which was increased by 22% in the fourth quarter of 2014 we'll return more than $1.2 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2015.", "So now, with year two behind us and year three underway, I'll underscore just how very confident we are in our ability to achieve our 2017 goals.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to our coalition leaders to provide more detail on 2014 and what to expect in 2015. Let's kick it off with Steve Rendle.", "Steve Rendle", "Starting with Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Fourth quarter revenue was up 13% or 16% on a currency neutral basis. This strength was broad-based with strong growth in wholesale and D2C as well as double-digit growth in nearly every brand including The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Kipling, Napapijri, Reef, lucy and Eagle Creek. What a portfolio and what an engine it is firing on all cylinders and housing VF's next billion-dollar brands.", "Now let's take a look at VF's three largest businesses. Starting with The North Face. Fourth quarter global revenues were up 12% or 14% on a currency neutral basis. Global D2C revenues were up 30% and included double-digit comps. So, continued fantastic strength in that business.", "In the Americas, which represents about 70% of TNF's full year sales, fourth quarter revenues were up at a mid teen rate with D2C growth of more than 25% and a high single-digit wholesale growth. 2014 had one of the strongest product offerings in TNF's history, innovations that defined new subsets of the outdoor performance category, products that expanded our reach into all four seasons of the year attracting new consumers and a precursor to what we believe is one of the most revolutionary fabrication technologies in more than a decade.", "Let me give you some highlights. Our ThermoBall line has continued on its incredible growth trajectory. At the end of only its second year ThermoBall has clearly established itself as the consumer choice for transitional weight outerwear. The line was a top seller throughout the year and ended 2014 with global revenue exceeding $100 million. 2015 will see an even more robust expansion of this high-performance innovation and we really feel like we're just getting started.", "Launched last spring our Mountain Athletics training collection continued to drive growth throughout the year giving consumers an increasingly broader offering to stay in The North Face brand when they are training to be on the trail, rock, ice and snow. The collection increased momentum throughout the year in both our own retail stores and with wholesale partners and we expect this momentum to increase even more in 2015 when we extend the product line to include a women's collection.", "One of the biggest innovation stories for 2014, although available only in a limited release was FuseForm. FuseForm is a revolutionary technology that allows us to weave two fiber types into a single fabric. By being able to simplify manufacturing, reduce weight and deliver a consistent aesthetic that maximizes breathability and durability, we can engineer garments to perform where and how an athlete needs it. The FuseForm Brigandine jacket as part of our Steep Series range showed great results in the fourth quarter and one Outside Magazine\u2019s 2015 Gear of the Year. This along with the launch of the Dot Matrix jacket this spring gives us great confidence that we've just raised the bar once again.", "The evolution of our ability to connect with consumers also took a significant leap forward in 2014 through a number of print, digital and TV initiatives, creating meaningful and emotional engagements with the brand. In November we launched the amazing Your Land campaign, which highlights the inspirational and emotional reasons to explore the outdoors. Since then we received more than 7.4 million YouTube views and driven more than 2.1 billion impressions and more than just a marketing campaign this effort has raised over a quarter million dollars that goes directly to help conserve our national parks, right to the very heart of the brand's DNA.", "In 2014, The North Face past $2.2 billion in revenues, up 11% on a reported basis or 12% currency neutral. We're truly seeing great momentum in this brand around the world and are well-positioned to realize another strong year.", "Looking at 2015 we expect The North Face's global revenues to see low double-digit currency neutral growth right in line with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis, revenue should be at a mid single-digit growth.", "Now, let me turn it over to Karl Heinz Salzburger, to walk you through TNF's results in Europe and Asia.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you and good morning everyone. The North Face international business was up at the high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe, which is about 20% of the brands full-year sales, fourth quarter revenues were up at low single-digit rate currency neutral. For the full year, revenues were also up at low single-digit currency neutral rate reflecting a tough microenvironment and a general weakness in the outdoor market. In 2015 we are expecting a slight improvement in currency neutral revenues due to our strongest ever product offering and successful go-to-market strategies.", "Asia, revenues were up more than 25% in the quarter, where we continue to make good progress building brand awareness. This is evidenced by the incredibly strong launch of our Thermoball product during the year and great initial response that retailers are showing for FuseForm. Our online business also remains a key driver of growth with sales up more than 80% for the quarter.", "We saw very strong results in Hong Kong for the year, great momentum with our Taiwan distributor and great momentum in China, where sales were up nearly 20%. We're pleased that we are creating deeper, lasting connections with the Asian consumer and look forward to building on this momentum. Taken together, The North Face is in a leading position as we wrap up year two of our five-year plan and remain on track with our financial targets. Now, let's turn to Vans.", "Steve Rendle", "Vans showed strong performance in the fourth quarter with revenues up 17% or 20% on a currency neutral basis. This marks the brand's 25th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a big result that helped Vans become the second $2 billion brand in VF's portfolio.", "In the Americas which is about 60% of the brand's full-year sales, fourth quarter revenues increased 20%, slightly ahead of our expectations, connecting with consumers through the creative expression in action sports, music, art and street culture is something the Vans team does extremely well and the fourth quarter was no exception. A great example was the 32nd annual Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, which took place in the North Shore of Oahu. Surfers from around the world entered their year on Hawaii's iconic waves and this year 10 million people who couldn't make the trip viewed the action live online. We also garnered more than 100 million social media impressions and press coverage in more than 50 countries worldwide. This is a clear indication that a lot of people choose the Vans brand as the epicenter of youth culture.", "In 2015 there's no slowdown as we'll continue to build on this momentum with events such as custom culture, the Vans Warped Tour and House of Vans to drive home Vans unique Off the Wall culture. And of course a few product highlights. We recently introduced weatherized footwear designed to keep you warm and dry in the outdoor elements. So just like The North Face moving forward toward a four season offering so was Vans and that's important because consumers shouldn't have to step out of their vans because of weather. It's their flag. It expresses their creativity and now they have more choices for different climates and really exciting the response thus far has been incredible and we have plans to significantly expand this collection in the back half of 2015.", "We're also introducing a new footwear concept, Classic Plus that will feature restructured trend focused product. We're really excited about this concept and can't wait to talk more about it in the coming months. Global revenues for the Vans brand in 2014 were up 17% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. This increase is ahead of our 2017 plan and clear evidence that is the world's largest youth culture brand we are firing on all cylinders globally and our momentum is strong.", "In 2015 we expect Vans global currency neutral revenues to be up in a mid teen rate consistent with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis, revenue should be at a high single-digit growth rate, strong brand, strong plan and a fun year ahead. KH ", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Vans international revenues were up at 18 percentage rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe, which is about 30% of the brands full year sales, currency neutral revenues were up at high single-digit rate in the quarter. Vans continued to deliver amazing consumer experiences with many events and interaction to London's House of Vans. This venue has quickly become a fantastic destination for youth culture to experience the brand. We look forward to using this showcase in an even greater way in '15 and just like in the Americas we're also focused on growing our relevant, innovative products such as weatherized footwear and apparel as well as updating classics to reflect current trends and getting very strong response from our efforts. Our e-commerce business also has been a great success story for Vans as we reach even more consumers.", "In Asia, we are seeing strength across the board. The quarter's revenues were up more than 50% with particular strength in China and Korea. Like Europe, we are seeing strength in our weatherized lines and continue to get traction against our localized products, specifically apparel.", "In terms of brand activation we completed an incredibly successful House of Vans store across three countries, our Vans China retail road show across several cities and an Asia Pacific skate tour. We also opened up an experimental retail store in Seoul, Korea that brought the House of Vans elements of live music, local artist galleries and special edition product into our retail environment. Definitely been busy making some great connections with our consumers in 2015 and look forward to building on this momentum for 2015.", "And now on to Timberland.", "Steve Rendle", "Four quarter global revenues for Timberland were up 11%, up 15% on a currency neutral basis. In the Americas, which represents about 40% of the brand's annual sales, revenues were up nearly 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by incredibly strong growth in our wholesale business. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the Americas momentum we look forward to building on in 2015. This is a testament to great brand strength driven by strong consumer reception for our products, high customer demand for future collections and our intense focus on amplifying our connection with the outdoor lifestyler consumer.", "On the product front growth continues to be really well balanced across our all footwear and apparel categories with particular strength in casual and outdoor footwear for men and women. Our Pro Boondock family of footwear also continued its solid momentum.", "On the apparel side sales are driven primarily by outerwear from shirt jackets to insulated product to beautiful leather bombers really strong and balanced growth. In marketing, we continue to build brand heat in relevance with our core target the outdoor lifestyler consumer.", "In Q4 alone Timberland created a shared more than 350 pieces of engaging style rich content anchored by the highly successful Mark Maker's Influencer Program. We gained extensive coverage of our new fall collections and influential print and digital outlets garnering some 800 million media impressions. In 2014 full-year global revenues were up 13%, up 15% on a currency neutral basis, which is actually ahead of the 2019 plan we set in September. With $1.8 billion on the top line in 2014 this marks the brand's highest ever revenues, something the team is very proud of and they should be.", "Looking at 2015, we expect Timberland's global revenues to see low teen currency neutral growth rate right in line with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis revenue should be up at a mid single-digit growth rate. Now back to KH.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's international revenues were up at the high single-digit percentage rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe just about 40% of the brands full year sales fourth quarter revenues were up at the mid single digit rate currency neutral. The quarter was driven by strong sales of SensorFlex, our newest technology platform as well as Cupsole for men, while casual boots were strong on the woman's side.", "During the quarter, we continued to grow our footprint in the region opening two new stores and 20 franchise locations. We also rolled out our new e-commerce site design, which drove a big jump in conversion and an increase in sales. We expect growth in the region to continue in 2015.", "In Asia, fourth quarter revenues increased at double-digit rate currency neutral. In this region the classic yellow boot performed well in all markets and we saw great early success with the launch of the Britton Hill line. Additionally, apparel had a particularly strong quarter with great results from our men's outerwear including rainwear and jackets. We are more confident than ever about the Timberland brand. The global team and efforts to significantly move this brand forward are working well and they're just getting started.", "Before I move forward, I'd like to talk about two brands that are based in Europe and continue to perform exceptionally well, Kipling and Napapijri. Kipling's global business posted an 18% increase in 2014 global revenues, just on top of the 29% growth it posted in 2013. This marks the second year in a row that Kipling has been Vans fastest growing brand. Napapijri finished strong in 2014 with fourth quarter revenues up nearly 30% or more than 40% currency neutral and really winning Vans fastest growing band of the quarter award. For the full year Napapijri was up at low double-digit rate. Both of these brands have fantastic long-term potential and might one day join the billion-dollar brand category. And now back to Steve.", "Steve Rendle", "Turning to our Sportswear and Contemporary businesses. Sportswear's fourth-quarter revenues were up 4% driven by growth in the D2C channel. Nautica's revenues were flat, with low teen growth in D2C including significant e-commerce strength, partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in its wholesale business. Kipling's North America business continued its run of double-digit gains posting 25% growth including a 35% increase in D2C sales and a mid single-digit growth in wholesale during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect Kipling to achieve strong double-digit growth throughout the year.", "Revenue in our Contemporary Brand coalition was down slightly in the quarter, were up slightly on a currency neutral basis due to as we've already discussed category and channel challenges. Where we control the brand ourselves, in other words in our own D2C businesses, we did see a double-digit currency neutral revenue increase. Our data shows that we're not only maintaining, but also gaining market share from our competitors in a pressured category.", "Now, I\u2019ll pass it to Scott to discuss our Imagewear business.", "Scott Baxter", "Thanks Steve. Our Imagewear coalition posted revenue growth of 4% in the fourth quarter, up 5% currency neutral, consistently solid top and bottom line growth from our Imagewear group all year long. Both our workwear and Licensed Sports Group businesses contributed to the growth. Our workwear business was driven by new product introductions at Red Kap and Bulwark, for example the iQ product at Bulwark as well as strength in the core business. LSG saw double-digit gains in the quarter from its MLB business due to strong postseason sales.", "And now, onto the Jeanswear business.", "Fourth quarter global revenues for the Jeanswear coalition were up 3% or up 5% on a currency neutral basis. For the full year 2014 global Jeanswear revenues were flat at $ 2.8 billion on a currency neutral basis. Revenues were up 1%. In the Americas region, revenues were up at a similar rate as the global results and were driven by particular strength from the Wrangler brand and its Western Specialty business. Revenues for the Wrangler in the fourth quarter were up at a low single-digit rate or up at a mid single-digit rate currency neutral.", "Customers have responded very well to our recent new product introductions including the Advanced Comfort in Heavenly Touch lines as well as our no iron khaki pants. Our Western specialty business had a very strong quarter with revenues up 13% driven by strong holiday sales in Western retail and mid tier accounts as well as the successful launch of men's Rock 47 jeans targeting fashion conscious Western consumers. We have also elevated the brand with our expansion into the mid tier department store channel and are planning to add more doors in 2015.", "Our marketing campaigns during the quarter were a big success including great response to our TV and print strategies. We launched a premium performance of Vans Comfort campaign featuring rodeo champion Trevor Brazile at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Competition in December, where Trevor won his 12th All Around World Championship. On the digital front, the Wrangler Network App had its best quarter yet with fans connecting with the Western lifestyle wherever they are.", "During the fourth quarter, revenues for the Lee Brand were up slightly. A result we're pleased with given ongoing channel and category challenges. We continue to see success with our Modern Series products and expect this momentum to build in 2015. We are also working to reinvent some of our more traditional products such as our core and premium select men's jeans and are excited to bring new finishes to the marketplace in 2015. Department store expansion also continued during the quarter and will continue well into 2015. ", "In 2015 we expect low single-digit growth for our Jeanswear coalition on both a reported and currency neutral basis and while it's clear that we'll continue to face difficult conditions in our Americas business, particularly in the U.S. mid tier and department store channel, we believe that we are weathering the storm well. Authentic and trend right product along with an intense focus on making sure our demand creation is industry-leading, puts us in a great position to win in 2015. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Our international Jeanswear business which is about a quarter of the coalition's global revenues was up 9% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. By region, European revenues for Jeanswear were up 10% currency neutral and in Asia revenues were up at high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis.", "Our international Wrangler business was up at mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. Innovative products continued to lead the way including great response in Europe from our denim performance programs and outerwear category supported by the latest campaign featuring Formula One Champion, Kimi Raikkonen. In Asia, the largest growth driver was also denim performance which was up 26% over last year including a standout performance from our Silver Shield antibacterial denim product.", "Lee's international revenues were up at low double-digit rate in the quarter with strong growth in both Europe and Asia, particularly in the U.K., Scandinavia and China. In Europe Lee's 125th anniversary collection featuring guest designers is generating a tremendous buzz around the brand with all of our key accounts showing double-digit gains. In Asia, we also saw really strong performance from our 125th anniversary product along which strong sell through of our 101+ collection, great testament to the work we have been doing in the brand and the strong products that we are producing that resonate well with consumers. In summary, we're making great progress in our global Jeanswear business.", "Eric Wiseman", "And with that we concluded our prepared remarks and we're about to turn it over to the operator to open the line for question, but before I do that, I just want to share with you all that as Bob Shearer and I have discussed his departure from our company over the last six months, the one thing he said he is going to miss most is taking your questions. So I would ask you to load up and direct a lot of questions to Bob because it will just make his day.", "Operator, we'll take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti", "Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks Michael.", "Michael Binetti", "And Bob, first of all, it has obviously been a great pleasure working with you all these years.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks so much Michael.", "Michael Binetti", "Regarding the comments on gross margin, you guys obviously went into it a bit in the prepared remarks, but you're going to be 30 basis points shy of your 2017 target. I know you don\u2019t want to update your guidance with us here during Q&A, but maybe just a few thoughts on how you think about that after you pulled forward that expansion in your five-year window and I don't think you want us to assume that the gross margins flatten out in our models here quickly after that?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, Michael, you didn\u2019t have to take Eric seriously on that.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you, Michael. ", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, Michael, the way to think about this going forward is pretty much what we've seen. You know, as I said in the comments that we just don't see any change in terms of that mix benefit being any different going forward. So that 60 or 70 basis points of benefit that we've seen from mix consistently year-after-year over the past number of years, we'd expect to see that kind of expansion going forward as well. So you know, barring any other unforeseen changes in product costs or pricing or something like that which we wouldn\u2019t expect at this point you know, we expect to see that continued expansion pretty much related to the mix just like we've been seeing.", "Michael Binetti", "Okay, and then maybe a followup if you could tells us a little bit about the backlogs for the big brands as we think about the organic revenue growth here and it looks like you expect it to accelerate a little bit in a tough global macro here? And maybe also your long-term guidance, I know it includes a little bit of SG&A deleverage [every year] [ph] is probably related towards the shift, towards more retail, but I think you've said most of the SG&A in 2014 was due to an accounting change. So as you lap that maybe there could be a little more room to step up marketing to drive the top line in 2015 or maybe just a few thoughts on marketing spend year-over-year? Thanks.", "Bob Shearer", "So, Michael, your question is mostly around what we see in terms of SG&A going forward, is that\u2026?", "Michael Binetti", "Well, I'm trying to figure out what you\u2019re seeing maybe in the backlogs to help the organic revenue growth rate accelerate into 2015, it's a tough world and then as a corollary may be there is some incremental marketing spend that helps drive that if you're comfortable with it?", "Bob Shearer", "Well I'll speak to that, I can speak to the marketing spend and what's planned. You know, we are looking obviously for another increase and as we said, what we've been really, really successful in doing in the SG&A area is we've been able to spend against DTC and as you know, that would naturally lift our SG&A ratio. We've also been spending more particularly in the dollar side and you also know that we've incrementally been increasing our marketing spend as a percent of revenue as well.", "So, as we look at 2015 yeah, we expect to spend another $50 million or so against marketing. We'll keep the ratio relatively flat, just around the 6% mark, maybe just a little below the 6% mark. So it will give us some additional dollars and we have been spending those additional dollars and all the analysis that we've done and the analytics say that we've been getting a great payback from that and it is giving us that momentum that you mentioned. Anything more from that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, so Michael, I will add a little bit on our big brands. We stopped giving really information or guidance on our backlogs a few quarters ago. What I can tell you is, is the backlog information that we have to-date is baked into our guidance for '15. But as we think about how to drive additional organic growth, I would tell you two things and you referenced marketing.", "I think we continue to get better and better as marketers of these brands as we become more and more knowledgeable of our consumers and I think the TV campaign that The North Face put out this fall, This Land is Your Land, what you see the Vans do with events to the in-store experience that we're bringing across to all of these big brands really helps drive awareness and builds that loyalty. But I think probably one of the largest factors that we feel really strong about is our improving digital capability and what we're able to do online through communicating, but also transacting through our expanding VF e-commerce platform and all of these big brands have access and are growing in that capability.", "Michael Binetti", "Thanks a lot guys.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks Michael.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob Drbul", "Hi, Good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Good morning Bob.", "Bob Drbul", "Bob Shearer, congratulations, best of luck.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you, Bob.", "Bob Drbul", "Yes thank you for being my friend.", "Bob Shearer", "That's good.", "Bob Drbul", "Great job.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you very much. Thank you", "Bob Drbul", "I guess this following Eric's lead on the questions Bob, can you talk a little bit about the expenses in Europe and sort of the European headquarters, you know sort of how that shrank through the P&L and how we should think about your positioning maybe in Switzerland specifically?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah Bob, so back to some of the comments on currency, just to reiterate, you know, nearly all of the currency impact that we're talking about is related to translation, you know, which we don't hedge. We do hedge the transactional side and it's very seldom that you ever hear us talking about the transactional side and that's because we have a really effective and efficient hedging program that covers those risks.", "To your point relative to the Swiss franc that was one that we kind of couldn't see coming, you know, which had always been pegged to the euro and so the change, the move by the Swiss government you know, caught us with some increase in our reported expenses. So what happens is the Swiss franc strengthened actually. We had to record higher dollars as expenses. So it\u2019s just an expense item, not revenues, just expenses went up just because of that move. And that's pretty much what we were talking about on the transactional side. It's almost all related to that. ", "Now, you know, going forward and related to our headquarters in Switzerland we don't see that changing at all. Now we\u2019ll see what happens with the Swiss franc, but you know in terms of any operational changes or anything like that we wouldn\u2019t contemplate any changes.", "Bob Drbul", "Great, thanks. And just a question on Timberland, how much of the success has been the yellow boot and sort of how broad has the business really increased throughout the world?", "Steve Rendle", "Yeah, Bob, I'll take that. This is Steve. Certainly the yellow boot has played a part in Timberland's growth, but it is a high single-digit contributor from a revenue standpoint. It is not the primary driver. Our growth has been balanced across all categories, both footwear and apparel across wholesale and DTC, across men's and women's and really balanced across all of our regions. So, you know the boot though important really just informs the best then better now mentality that Timberland is putting against this brand as they expand the reach and accessibility of this brand. ", "Bob Drbul", "Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Steve Rendle", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks, good morning. Great job on the quarter guys. Bob, congratulation on a great career and thanks for all your help over the years.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you, Omar.", "Omar Saad", "I wanted to ask another question on FX and Bob, you did a great job helping us understand the transactional impact on you guys hedge it, but how long are those hedges and how should we think about what happens to those dollar-denominated costs, whether it's on the SG&A side or on the cost of goods side, when those hedges roll off and I don\u2019t know six, nine, 12 months. Just kind of help me understand how the gross margin might look in '16?", "Bob Shearer", "You know, so what we do is our hedging actually covers us for 12 to 18-month period. So we go fairly long on that. Now over time you know, however, over a longer period of time, we have to look at leverage points for us like pricing. You know, so if currency rates stay where they are today you we'll look at pricing our goods to offset those I\u2019ll call them cost increases. So you know, we do have those that kind of flexibility, but that\u2019s a longer-term view.", "So, we take a fairly long approach in terms of our hedging practices. So it covers us exactly to your point over the next 12 to 18 months and then on a longer-term basis we look at pricing. You know, for example to [hold] [ph] our margins improve. So over the longer-term if you look back over time that's worked really, really well for us. You know, what it gives us is certainty for the upcoming year and then it gives us the ability to make pricing adjustments over a longer period of time to hold and continue to grow our margins.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks, it's super helpful and then Eric, a question for you. You know that VF is always kind of looking for other brands to acquire and with the news around right after they are in Splendid, 7 and Ella Moss, may be you can take the opportunity to talk about kind of some of the learnings from those acquisitions and how it pertains to how you think about future brands that you may acquire?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, you are right. We are an acquisition minded company and we are probably as frustrated as those of you who want us to make acquisitions. We're probably as frustrated as you are about our lack of getting anything done recently. However, we remain very disciplined and when we find the right opportunity to make strategic and value creation sense for us we are in a great position to pull the trigger and go. We have a lot of capacity to acquire.", "One of the things, that we do a postmortem on a decades worth of acquisitions every year with our Board of Directors. We review everything we've acquired in the last 10 years and look at their performance and there's always ups and downs. The truth is about what happened with these contemporary businesses is the impairment charge we took was mostly a reflection of the difference between our current assumptions and the assumptions that we made when we acquired and purchased these businesses.", "We bought 7 For All Mankind in the summer of 2007 and our outlook for it didn't anticipate a lot of the environment that we've seen since then. That means we're standing today not where we thought we'd be and that's resulted in the accounting charge. It doesn't mean we're not committed to that space. We talked about our overall strategy is mainly needs of apparel shoppers whenever and wherever they shop. There is an important segment that shops in the contemporary space worldwide and we have great brands to meet their needs. We do expect as Bob said in his comments I think, from the standpoint growth and profitability improvement in those businesses.", "Omar Saad", "Does the strong dollar at all make the potential for maybe European acquisition look a little bit more attractive with the dollar up so much against the euro?", "Eric Wiseman", "Of course, yes it does.", "Omar Saad", "Thanks guys.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research.", "Kate McShane", "Thanks, good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hi Kate.", "Bob Shearer", "Hi Kate.", "Kate McShane", "Just following up on the question on the acquisition side Eric, you had mentioned that a little bit frustrating getting something done. Could you elaborate on that all, is it more to do with willing sellers, is it valuation, is it the competition for assets in the market?", "Eric Wiseman", "We are, there's a series of things going on there. We have certainly been involved in discussions with companies as we always have been. If I look back over the last 15 years that I've been involved in that process we always have a bunch of businesses that we're actively engaged in, but we can never anticipate when those discussions will result in an acquisition, using Timberland as is a great example. We were in discussion with them for decades and finally found the right moment for that one to activate.", "We have very clear internally, we know where we are hunting. We've talked externally that it's primarily in the Outdoor and Action Sports base. I said primarily not exclusively. To the last question, yeah international is looking more and more attractive to us because of the strength of the U.S. dollar and we're continuing to have discussions with people. We just don't have anything we can talk about today.", "Kate McShane", "Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And maybe if I could ask a question about denim, on denim with the lower gas prices, are you seeing any positive impact from that and how should we think about the cadence of denim growth and is that some of your innovation initiative this year?", "Scott Baxter", "Hey Kate, this is Scott. How are you?", "Kate McShane", "Good, thank you.", "Scott Baxter", "Well, you asked about the gas prices and absolutely when you see gas prices contract like they have in the economy, that is absolutely helpful for us, especially when you think about the channels that we traded mid tier and mass that frees up a lot of income for the folks that are in those channels. And we have really big franchises with our Lee and Wrangler brand in those channels.", "So, we saw some really nice momentum in both our Wrangler and our Lee brands in the fourth quarter, that's carried over here after the first of the year and it's not just the gas, I think there's a little bit of confidence that's going on in addition to the gas and also there's a little bit of a job recovery that's going on. So all those factors combined have really helped our business and we've seen some momentum and we're pretty happy with it.", "And I think if you just couple that Kate, with the fact that our new products are really working, so we've had a series of new product introductions and some really innovative ones whether it's Advanced Comfort or No Iron Khaki or an Easy Fit or a Comfort Fit in the mid tier channel, those things have really worked and that's really helped us. So the consumer that's coming in that has a little bit more income right now, they're seeing some new products. They really like the new products like a Heavenly Touch and they are purchasing those new products. So it's been a nice combination for us here in the last five, six months.", "Kate McShane", "Okay, thank you and if I can just squeak out my congratulations to Bob as well and thank you for all the help. Thank you.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you, Kate.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I believe during the 2013 Investor Day it was noted that the international gross margin was 700 bps higher than the overall company gross margin. I was curious to know where it stands today, what is the potential FX impact to the 700 basis points relative for 2015 and are you raising prices in Europe to offset U.S. COGS?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, the international gross margins are similarly as strong as they were if not little bit stronger. You know, one of the things we're seeing in 2015, what happens is from a gross margin standpoint, is as we translate our international currencies into dollars and results in fewer dollars it's a little bit more of a mix impact than anything else. So what we're not seeing, we're not seeing any decline on a euro basis for example in our gross margin rates. What we're seeing overall for VF Corporation is we have fewer converted dollars, translated dollars right, which impacts the overall mix. So our margins, our profitability on our international businesses is quite strongly.", "We made the point in the past that the ratio of our overall revenues to international in our earnings contribution from international is very, very strong. It's the highest within the company. So again, it's a little bit more of a mix issue than anything else and not a rate issue. So I'm glad you asked the question because we want to make sure that that's really clear. That's where our hedging programs really help protect us against gross margin rates on a euro basis for example.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Okay great and then on Timberland, Timberland Americas continues to be reporting very strong numbers, up 25%, last quarter was 22%. I was curious to know how we should think about the guide of 14% growth in the Americas? And then I think during the Investor Day it was noted that the operating margin at that point was around projected to be 13% for 2014.", "I was hoping to know how that pended down, how we should we think about the long term guide on the operating margin?", "Eric Wiseman", "I\u2019ll take this question for you Laurent. So how should you think about the long term growth rate, we've have guided on a global basis up low teens. That certainly would hold true with our Americas businesses and we see it to be very balanced. Wholesale been a significant driver as the brand is really focused on placing the right products in the right channels segmenting the product and allocating their product and supporting that with really, really strong marketing.", "Our D2C business will continue to grow. We are now at a place where we are comfortable opening new stores as we've right sized our model and we'll look to start building up full price to really balance out with our current outlook mix and then Timberland will be coming on the VF e-commerce platform here in the United States in the second quarter and we are looking for accelerated growth in the back half based on that enhanced content and commerce capability.", "Operating margin, Bob will go ahead and take you there.", "Bob Shearer", "Sure, on the operating margin, you've obviously seen and we talked about it in our comments as well that our operating margins in Outdoor & Action Sports continues to expand. And while most of our businesses are growing particularly gross margins as well as operating margins on the Timberland component of that is a big factor.", "We said earlier in the acquisition that we saw that as a significant opportunity at the time of the acquisition operating margins were in the 8% or 9% range and that's improved dramatically over time and we're just continuing to improve. So we're getting back close to that 20% operating margin that we enjoyed prior to the Timberland acquisition and we're moving back closer and closer to that. And we will continue see expansion in the operating margin at Timberland.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Okay great, best of luck.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robby Ohmes", "Oh, thanks and Bob you will be missed and best of luck to what you do next.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks very much Robby.", "Robby Ohmes", "Just a few followup questions, the first one I was wondering if you could give us any color on how the sort of followup, how the outlet store business is relative to full line, some others that have commented have seen more difficult outlet business? And then second question would just be, I think sports were, I think you guys in the release kind of highlighted the challenging U.S. department store channel, was that primarily Nautica or was that across brands and sort of how do you think about that channel for 2015? And then the third one and I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you guys comment on Lucy and if not sort of an update on how that brand is doing? Thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Do you want to start with the department store?", "Steve Rendle", "I\u2019ll take the Sportswear and Lucy question Robby and then we will catch you on the outlets on the back side. So the comment you saw on Sportsware related to the department store was primarily Nautica. They are most heavily penetrated in that channel. And certainly we compete for our consumers in that space and some of that sits on us with a better and better product that we put into that product and how we are able to represent that. But I think it has been pretty well documented that that channel through this year has seen some opportunities for improvement and we certainly worked very diligently with our partners to help drive our brands through those channels of distribution.", "Our Lucy business, we could not be more proud of and excited. We have seen really consistent growth. We expect that business to grow in the mid single-digits coming into this year with more than 20% growth in our whole sale business and that is coming with our relationship that started with Dick's Sporting Goods at the end of '13. We're now in 365 Dick's Sporting Goods stores in the Women's performance or studio area and have seen really good growth as our team learns how to operate with a large dynamic retailer such as Dick's Sporting Goods.", "We're seeing improvements in our own stores as we look to really improve our traffic in conversion through really growing awareness within those markets where we have stores. So, Lucy continues to get better and better and we think this push into the wholesales channel is certainly helping it gain more and more traction.", "Robby Ohmes", "Yeah, sorry, just the Outlets versus sole line and any color you can give us across your brands?", "Scott Baxter", "So Robby, I\u2019ll make a couple of quick comments. This is Scott on the VF Outlet stores. As you know, we have roughly 80 of those stores and we have seen some nice momentum in the fourth quarter moving into the first quarter from an outlet standpoint. That channel was very vibrant. The shoppers were actually moving to that channel and have really seen that there is value in that channel for our brands and value for the consumer there. So we've seen some momentum. It's carried forward this year and we are really happy and pleased with where our business is positioned there right.", "Eric Wiseman", "Robby it's Eric. I'm going to try to peal this back a little bit about the outdoor and full price. It's a complicated question because we have outlet and full price stores around the world. In the United States, most of our business other than the VFO business that Scott referred to is full price retail.", "We certainly do have outlets stores, but most of our brands use them as a place to manage their distressed inventory. The exceptions to that actually are Nautica and Kipling both of which have primarily outlet store businesses and they are working really hard to make those stores, Nautica no full price stores. I am going to guess that 80% of the Timberland stores are outlet versus full price. So, their whole business model is making the outlet model work for them. They don\u2019t have a full price comparison. Where we have full price stores, which is primarily around our Vans and The North Face brands we have really strong full price business. We bring our very best stuff to those stores and that is where we see those as our way to develop the digital economy channel strategy.", "We want to go into cities and have people be able to come into a Vans as a North Face store and really see everything that is true about the brand. Europe in general is a full price retail store market for us. We do have some outlet stores there, but they are almost exclusively for excess inventory sell off. So it\u2019s a different strategy than some people use for their outlet stores. Did that help you?", "Robby Ohmes", "That does. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks Eric.", "Eric Wiseman", "Okay Robby.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan ", "Matthew Boss", "Good morning guys. Eric, can you talk about the global consumer backdrop? I guess specifically have you seen any fundamental trend change at all in Europe and just promotional levels post holiday, how you are thinking about things?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. I am actually going to ask Karl Heinz to speak about the Europe consumer and what we're seeing with our brands. He spends more time there than as I do. It's home.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "I do spend more time, at the moment I'm here in the U.S. so I think Matthew there is a lot going on in Europe as you related. So I really reported that in the press from an economically point of view and political which I am not touching.", "Having said that, it's not really helping consumer sentiment and making consumer spend, but having said that, as you heard from the release we do pretty well, and we see some come back from consumers surprisingly and especially from the southern European part, you know where we see our orders coming in pretty nicely and strong. So, all in all we are pretty positive about the performance of Europe and the outcome for the year, so which we expect as we said to be up. So, all in all I guess it\u2019s a better picture than last year.", "Matthew Boss", "Great. And then just any disruption that you've seen so far from the West Coast port strikes? And Eric I guess more importantly, just how this process works in terms of late orders kind of who is on the hook between the vender and wholesale partners, just any color you can provide?", "Eric Wiseman", "As a backdrop the West Coast port situation really began last summer. Our team has been navigating through that incredibly effectively, so much so that we haven\u2019t had any material misdeliveries or incremental costs. Have we had some misdelieveries? Yes. Have we had some incremental costs? Yes, but nothing that we need to call out anybody's attention.", "We have diverted stuff to other ports. We've moved part of our truck fleet out there to get our through the docks and off the platforms. There's a lot of things we've done that just haven\u2019t been material enough to talk about. But it is a complicated situation. If it does go to a full on strike and shutdown it will be material to everybody. Now the question is, how material and the answer to that is, you tell me how long the strike will be and I\u2019ll tell you how material. If it is one weekend, if it's one weekend we'll get through it. If it's three months, well I don\u2019t think that's even possible for it to be three months. It would be really important. Most of the cost associated with that sit with us. If our orders are late getting to customers, customers don\u2019t have to take them so. That\u2019s we bear the risk, but I would tell we've had that risk now for eight months and we have managed it really, really well. Is that helpful?", "Matthew Boss", "Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Congrats on a great quarter and Bob, sorry to see you go.", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, thanks a lot, Matt.", "Operator", "We are going next to Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy", "Good morning everyone. Hope you are all well. Bob, a sincere thanks for all your time and help over the years. Let's appreciate it.", "Bob Shearer", "Thank you.", "Jim Duffy", "My retirement gift I am going to direct my question to you colleagues.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I'm sorry Jim, we can't hear you, you're breaking up.", "Jim Duffy", "Couple of questions, one on Vans and then a question for Karl Heinz on the outside category in Europe. The Vans growth has been phenomenal, domestic in particular. As you look to build on this, can I ask that you elaborate on some of the specific drivers and geographies to watch for looking into 2015 with the Vans brand? Help that will be appreciated thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, I'll go and start that Jim and Cage can beat in for what's going on internationally. I think what we see currently driving Vans growth and what we see continuing to drive Vans growth is really broad based against all the tools that they have from a product standpoint just continuing to be the expert in the pool where category is specific to their consumer, bringing weatherized footwear this last year really showed us the opportunity to expand our offering to four seasons across the year and being able to complement that with apparel and accessories.", "So, continued just dialed focus on the appropriate products on a year around basis in footwear and apparel. Really the partnerships that we have in wholesale here in the North America business are second to none in how our teams work with our partners to bring our brands to life and assort this expanded set of products. How we are able to bring to life in our own stores to really set that experiential tone for our consumers is a great strength and we've been very systematic in how our retail footprint has expanded geographically throughout the United States into Canada and most recently into Mexico.", "And then you just think about our ability to connect digitally with our consumer. Vans is our most powerful social and digital brand and has been a big part of helping bring our VF e-commerce platform to life and how they use that to not only communicate and connect, but also transact will be another powerful tool that they have to drive growth.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes Jim and may be starting with Asia the outdoor market, you heard us saying we did pretty well in our up double digit both on the North Face and Timberland. So I would say that market is good. We had a few issues. There were some issues in China may be two years ago with the inventories, but that has sorted out.", "So that is pretty healthy market. Europe is a little bit more complicated. It\u2019s a very fragmented market as you know, many brands don\u2019t do well, some do okay. We have been consistent growth in the past. We have growth rates now where we're not really happy about, but we are confident we can improve our growth rate especially in the North Face in the future.", "There is a lot going on. You heard us saying with product innovation we have great market, go-to-market strategies. We show, we just did a show, actually the largest show in the Sporting Goods in Munich last weekend. There was a lot of noise and excitement about the North Face with our new approach we're doing better storytelling, a lot of product innovation. So going forward, I think even in a complicated market we are pretty confident.", "Jim Duffy", "And Karl Heinz, the challenges in Europe for the category, is that a weather dynamic or are there larger issues in that?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "I would say both. The weather was so-so. You heard that it was widely in the press. We had no winter up to December. We got I think some snow in January, so it is normalizing now, but the last two years were not so good from a weather point of view. Plus the economy, I think it's widely in press. There is a lot of noise going on in Europe at the moment, so that is not helping. But it can't be an excuse and we have to react and we are reacting and our product innovation is a strong answer to stimulate consumption. And you know, probably better and more digitalized approach and storytelling, which to make consumers spend on our brands.", "Jim Duffy", "Very good, thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We are going next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray", "Erinn Murphy", "Great, thanks good morning and thank you for sneaking me in Bob and I wish you all the best on you future endeavors.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks so much, Erinn.", "Erinn Murphy", "May be you guys could talk a little bit more about the three innovation centers that you are developing. When is the first time that we should start to see some of the benefit across the various product lines? And then just secondly, a quick follow up for Karl Heinz in Europe. Can you just speak to any volatility that you are seeing from a tourist world perspective into the region? Thank you ", "Eric Wiseman", "Yeah, so Erinn, I\u2019ll start and then Scott can jump in. We are standing up three innovation centers this year. You have certainly heard and seen us right about this. From a technical apparel and footwear standpoint those teams are in place and we are adding capabilities as we speak. And the pipeline that they are working on with the brand has in many ways already been in motion over the last 12 to 18 months and you see some small things coming into the product mix like the FuseForm is an area where we are bringing that capability to life near term. But it really is a longer term play as we add this skill and capability to complement our business teams it will about 12 to 18-month push till you see some of the real new ideas that have been percolating this team is able to work on.", "Scott Baxter", "So, just a few quick comments on the Jeanswear innovation center. We hired a leader last year and we have taken some time and really worked with the outdoor and the foot work group and we have cohesive strategy now between the three centers that will be working real closely together going forward because we want to share ideas, we want to share innovations and we want to go ahead and work together on platforms. And our leader has gotten us to the point where we've hired some folks and we have a few more to go, but we've really focused on capabilities that are important for us going forward to ensure our success.", "So getting the right people in place has been the key thing for us in the Jeanswear innovation center and I would say we are about 50% of the way there and we should be finalized here by early spring as far as having our key senior team all in place. We move into a physical location here this spring and then we are going to work on short term stuff to get the momentum going as we get in there. And that is just taking some ideation stuff that is actually happening right now within our Jeanswear group and having that team that is really capable working with those two groups to help them bring that to the goal line a little faster. And then that team will come into a cadence and they will start working on things that are a little bit more long term.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And on the last question, I would try to answer it, it is I'm not sure I can, but so much happened just in the last 30 days with all the currency, the euro, the Swiss franc, the dollar, the Ruble, and pound, so it's really to say what is going to happen for sure. I mean it has, the country has become cheaper for you. So you are welcome to come to Europe and spend you money. You got to take your weight. So, I guess I would say it's early to say what's going to happen.", "Scott Baxter", "And I'd like to build, I'd be remiss if our Timberland teams are listening. When we acquired timberland they came with an innovation capability and it in fact it's that capability that we are adding to in products like our Anti-Fatigue footwear that you see across our PRO and tree business. The Sensorflex that we've spoken about this last year, those are technologies have come out of that teams, skill and capability and that is exactly what we are building behind and building so all of our footwear businesses are able to tap into that skill.", "Erinn Murphy", "Great, thank you guys and best of luck.", "Scott Baxter", "Thanks Erinn.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitch Kummetz", "Yeah, thanks. Bob congrats and good luck. I've got a question for you if you don\u2019t want to answer you can always give it to Scott. So, how should we think about kind of quarterly gains of gross margin expansion this year? From you remarks it sounds like may be the cost outlook is a little better in the back half particularly on denim. But if I recall correctly, I think Jeanswear has got a pretty easy Q2 compare. So how should we think about that 40 bips over the course of the year?", "Scott Baxter", "Yeah, so Mitch, it has a lot to do with currency moves. So our bigger quarters for international businesses or our first and third quarters. So those will be the tougher comparisons when it comes to gross margin expansion. So, in other words the second and fourth quarters and that is where we will see the biggest gross margin expansion for the year.", "Again as I said earlier, that is mostly because of mix. Our international businesses are the profitability including the gross margin rates are really strong and when there is fewer dollars a very strong gross margins it just impacts the overall gross margin rates. So, it is not a rate within the international side of business. It is really a mix overall for VF.", "Mitch Kummetz", "And just a quick followup on Vans in Asia Pac it looks like a 40% plus this year, still growing after a relatively small base. Talk about kind of the outlook for that business in 2015 and can we expect to see continued sort of momentum of that magnitude going forward?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Mitch, I\u2019ll try to answer here. As you said, correctly we had really great numbers in the last quarters in Asia 40% to 50%. We just reported 50%. For sure we have great momentum. Going forward we see the advantage is really strong, it connects well with consumers. There is a lot of storytelling. So, we are pretty confident the momentum will continue. Will it be always 40% to 50% that is probably hard, but we are confident and we will look forward to very nice growth rates in the next quarters and hopefully years to come in Asia.", "Mitch Kummetz", "Okay, all right, thanks guys.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks Mitch.", "Operator", "Due to time constrains, we'll take our final question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great, thanks for taking the questions. So starting with the first one, Bob it was really helpful all of the detail on currency and costs. I was hoping that if we would assess forward to when your hedges and forward purchases roll off and we're just sort of marking to market, whether you could dementionalize how much the foreign currency transactional pressure on you cost of goods would be relative to the cost savings that you are likely to see from lower cotton and may be some lower energy prices in your factory, whether one is much bigger than the other or they are neutral or how we should we think about that? And on that topic also whether you will be able to divert some of your sourcing to non-U.S. dollar dominated factories to help sort of offset the pressure?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, on the gross margin side as we talked about earlier, the puts and takes from material cost standpoint and labor all inclusive kind of nets out with pricing. So, that\u2019s true whether it is in the U.S. also on the international side as well. Again it's just really important that our rates, our gross margin rates on the international front are holding and actually growing somewhat in our international businesses just the conversion of this in the U.S. dollars that are impacting us overall and even the gross margin rate.", "So, the commentary holds true that we talked about earlier relative to the inflict costs related to the international side as well as the U.S. side and that\u2019s because of hedging. So, we lock in those costs in essence over that 12 to 18-month period, we know what those costs are going to be, we lock it into our currency hedges and we don\u2019t get surprised.", "Scott Baxter", "In terms of changing relative to the dollars, not so likely. Frankly, given where we are again we will continue to hedge and our hedging practices will offset that. I think the question is more about if the rates stay where they are, what kind of actions do we take relative to our international business and again we discussed that earlier as well, but we'll have to look at pricing and some other levers, but that is a discussion relatively more to 2016 than 2015.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great. And just a quick follow on, I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about you strategy and accessories. There's been a really high quality category and you had some great momentum with Napapijri and Kipling. Can you may be just expand a little bit on what your plan is for accessories as a broad product category across your portfolio?", "Scott Baxter", "Yeah, Lindsay thanks for the question. What we are doing right now is, we are focused on the accessories businesses we have. We think Kipling is an enormous growth opportunity for our company and to put some context around that, it was less than $70 million business when we brought it and it is bigger than the $300 million business today and VF's fastest growing business in 2013 and '14 and it is planned to be our fastest going business this year because we have very capable people working on that business and we are investing in them disproportionally. Beyond that, we don\u2019t have any other big strategy to announce. We are focused on anything that strategy continue to work for us and Bob Shearer would add it\u2019s a very profitable business for us as well.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "Great, thanks so much.", "Eric Wiseman", "All right, thanks everybody. I'm sorry that we have to cut this call off. I know there were a few of you still waiting with questions. Several others have media interviews that begin in 60 seconds, so we need to run from this room and go handle those. I appreciate your interest in our company and your support.

", " Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston ", " Kate McShane - Citigroup ", " Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch ", " Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC ", " Angelique Dab - Nollenberger Capital Partners ", " Robert Samuels - J. P. Morgan ", "Operator", "Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day and welcome to the VF Corporation Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed into a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. ", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. David Griffith. Please go ahead, sir. ", "David E. Griffith - Vice President, Integrated Corporate Relations", "Good morning and thank you for participating in VF Corporation's second quarter 2007 conference call. By now you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call my office at 203-682-8213 and we'll get you a copy immediately following the call. ", "Hosting our call this morning is Mr. Mackey McDonald, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VF. ", "Before we begin, we would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and in the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mackey McDonald. ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We are very pleased to again report strong results ahead of our prior guidance. With entire industry, it does appear to be a fair amount of restructuring and positioning underway, fortunately the strategy that we initially launched in 2004 has proven to be exactly the right one for these changing times. ", "In terms of our brand portfolio, we've successfully transformed much of our mix away from lower-growth businesses to higher growth ones. And there's more to come. We've invested in our strongest heritage businesses; Jeanswear and Imagewear to keep them healthy and rolling. And we've had hesitated to exit underperforming businesses such as Intimate Apparel, which we sold in April. And perhaps most importantly, we have demonstrated our ability to successfully identify, acquire, integrate and grow new brands and businesses, including the North Face, Nautica, Vans, Reef, Napapijri, Kipling and Majestic. ", "We've addressed the changing dynamics in the retail landscape by diversifying our portfolio into powerful authentic lifestyle brands that has substantially strengthened our presence in specialty and owned retail. We put in place the foundation for future growth in such growing and dynamic markets such as China, India and Russia, by leveraging our well established infrastructure in Europe and Asia. Given the strength and diversity of our brand portfolio and our expertise in managing across complex geographies, we are very well positioned to capture significant growth in emerging as well as established international markets. ", "Our portfolio is in excellent shape today. As we look across our Jeanswear, Outdoor, Sportswear and Imagewear businesses, we see the strongest brands in the industry. We see tremendous opportunities for continued growth in new geographies and product extensions in owned retail stores and in e-commerce. And we see opportunities to round out our portfolio with additional brands and businesses to give us access to new consumers and markets. So we're quite confident about our future. ", "We continue to look forward to another record year in '07. In terms of our guidance for the second half of the year, some of you might be wondering what changed. We really don't see any specific changes in any of our businesses, but we are simply adopting a cautious approach which we certainly think is prudent, given the cost currents that are pressuring consumer spending. Regardless of how retail and consumer spending trend play out for the balance of the year, it has been proven time and again that authentic brands that are strongly connected to consumers will continue to be in demand. ", "Our excitement about the quarter was clearly dampened by the loss of one of our great and loved leaders in a tragic automobile accident on Saturday. Mike Corvino, President of JanSport will be missed. ", "Now let's hear from Eric about the coalition's performance. ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Mackey. I'll start today with Jeanswear and we are very pleased to post another quarter of top line growth with total revenues up 3%. That growth was fueled by our international business, which excluding the effects of currency grew by 7%. ", "Our re-brand in Europe is performing strongly, a result of positive reaction to new products including Lee, works of Denim premium line. We've further expanded Lee's retail footprint with six stores in Europe and now more to come. ", "In India, we operate store vendor partnership rather than owned model and we expect to double our total Jeanswear store count in India from around 70 at the beginning of the year to around a 140 by year-end. We are also delighted with the continued strong growth we are seeing in China. While still a relatively small business for us, our Jeanswear business there continues to grow at an annual rate of more than 40%. ", "We recently made some very important leadership changes in both our European Jeans and Asia Pacific businesses. We named Aidan O'Meara who previously headed our International Jeans business as President of VF Asia Pacific, a new position, where he will spearhead the expansion of all VF brands in the region. Aidan is responsible for developing and executing a comprehensive growth strategy for our entire portfolio of brands in the region. In addition, Giorgio Presca was named as President of International Jeanswear succeeding Aidan. Giorgio joins VF from Diesel, where he was the General Manager and was throughout they have him on Board and that will be a key driver of our future success in these important markets. ", "I also should note, we sold our H.I.S. brand in the quarter, which resulted in the $0.04 per share gain noted in the press release. This brand was still having a good position in Germany, had been underperforming for us over the last couple of years. Total annual revenues of the brand were $34 million last year and the transition of that business should be completed by the end of the year. ", "On the domestic front, our three primary businesses; Lee, Mass Market and Western Specialty had sales that were essentially flat with prior year levels. In terms of Lee, we continue to see healthy growth in our women's business which has been offset by lower sales in men's, as we've seen a move away from Carpenter style of jeans where we were strong. However, we are expecting an improvement in our men's business in the back half of this year as we introduce new programs and styles. ", "On the Mass Market side, our men's business is performing very strongly, up in the single-digits. There our female business is weaker. Some of our key customers have been... seen a slowdown in their traffic in their overall women's business. All in all, we are quite pleased with the performance of our domestic jeans business and are looking forward to a year that's inline with our target of low single-digit growth. ", "Jeanswear operating margins improved by more than 150 basis points to 15.5%, driven by a substantial improvement in the profitability of our International Jeanswear business. ", "Turning next to Outdoor, this business continues to have great momentum. As evidenced by the 20% revenue increase in the quarter and as we have seen in past quarters, the growth is taking place across most of our brands. North Face and Vans aren't the only strong growth businesses within Outdoor; in fact the North Face, Reef, Eastpak and Napapijri are growing in excess of 30% in the quarter. ", "Our domestic growth is tempered by lower revenues in JanSport, due to a shift in the timing of product shipments from the second to the third quarter. Internationally, our Outdoor business continued to achieve exceptional growth, both top and bottom line. We remain very, very positive about all the key growth initiatives underway in our Outdoor brands. The North Face remains focused on growing within its current limited distribution base with specific initiatives in place in footwear, owned retail stores, sportswear and emerging markets. ", "Vans is growing its core footwear business through wholesale, retail store expansion and e-commerce. We are also encouraged by the performance of Vans Apparel, which is a key growth driver for the brand. Reef is driving growth through innovation within its sandal business. ", "We recently introduced our girls sportswear and swim apparel line of the trade, positive reviews and are looking forward to launching a retail next spring. And internationally, the Reef brand was just getting started but we think there is great growth potential and our initial results are phenomenal. ", "Napapijri continues to be the hot brand in Europe and we think it has strong potential in Asia, particularly Japan. Whereas to Kipling, our growth is accelerating with very positive reaction to our newest product launches and comp store sales running over 20%. ", "Outdoor operating income was 25% in the quarter, with about a half point improvement in margin. ", "Now in terms our sportswear business, revenues grew a very healthy 9% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our Nautica men sportswear business is up low single-digits on a comp store basis across its U.S. department store customers. We had a solid Father's Day driven by the Deck shirt launch. The Nautica retail business in our owned stores and upscale outlet centers grew at a high single-digit rate with comp store sales growing at a mid single-digit rate. We have placed women sportswear in 31 outlet doors and that business is on plan. ", "Our women's business remains a work-in-progress and performance continues to improve. We are committed to getting the model right and we will continue to take a slow and steady approach to building this business overtime. ", "Our Kipling business in the U.S. was still very modest, is gaining great traction. We are bidding outdoor expansion targets and expect to be in 260 department store doors the following holiday. We are seeing great enthusiasm for our Fergie for Kipling line. Yes, that is Fergie, a black-eyed peas name, which we've recently launched. And finally, our John Varvatos brand continues to expand rapidly with sales up approximately 50% in the quarter. The performance of the John Varvatos Star USA line has been very strong at retail. And the performance of our six owned stores has also been strong, with our newest store in East Hampton running well ahead of plan. Sportswear operating income increased 3% in the quarter, with operating margins remaining above 12%. ", "And I will conclude with Imagewear, revenues also grew in the quarter, up 22%. The gain resulted from a February acquisition of Majestic Athletic, and we are very pleased with Majestic's performance. We finalized our extension with Major League baseball to 2014, giving a solid platform for continued growth. The integration is proceeding ahead of schedule, there is no hiccups there. ", "Excluding Majestic, Imagewear revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Some of the decline is due to the exit of the commodity food business and in addition, we experienced the timing of some stores sets being moved back due to the cautious retail environment. On the positive side, our protective and government business is growing strongly. We do expect positive organic growth to resume in the third quarter. ", "Operating income declined 10% with margins down 400 basis points from very robust levels last year, reflecting a less favorable business mix. But as noted in the release, operating margins are expected to show substantial improvement in the second half of the year. ", "That wraps up our discussion about coalition results and now I'll turn the call over to Bob Shearer, who will take us through the financials for the quarter. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, thanks Eric. Okay, let's start at the top, total revenues grew bit over 12% in the quarter with growth across all coalitions, as Eric just discussed. Majestic and Eagle Creek acquisitions contributed a total of $54 million to revenues in the quarter. If you exclude acquisitions, our organic growth rate for the quarter was quite strong at 8%. ", "Now, you'll recall that our previous guidance for revenue growth in the quarter was 14%, and a variety of factors, no one single large issue account for the difference. Part of the difference is represented by a shift in timing of shipments, particularly in our Outdoor and active wear businesses. Also, our life and sports apparel replenishment business was slower than anticipated. This business is expected to show stronger comparisons in the second half of the year. ", "Gross margins were down slightly to 42.9% from 43.3%, partly due to the H.I.S. sale. A small charge worth 20 basis points related to the sale was recorded in the cost of goods sold. Also, Imagewear gross margins were lower than those of their unusually strong prior year second quarter. ", "Operating income rose 16%, operating margins up 30 basis points to 11.1%. Now, as noted in the release, the increase includes the benefit of the H.I.S. gain. On a most comparable basis, where excluding this gain, operating margins would have been 20 basis points lower, reflecting the lower Imagewear operating margins. ", "Now I'd remind everyone that this is our seasonally smallest quarter and so the margins are not indicative of what we expect for the full year. For the full year, we continue to expect an approximate 40 basis point improvement in operating margins, nearing 14% level. For the third quarter, we expect our operating margins to be comparable to the prior year quarter, which was 15.9%. ", "After interest and taxes, income from continuing operations for the quarter was up 18%, with EPS from continuing operations up slightly less or 16%, due to higher average shares outstanding and a slightly higher tax rate. Now reflecting the impact of discontinued operations resulting from the sale our Intimates business, net income was $81.7 million or $0.72 per share. Now, related to discontinued operations, not all assets related to the sale of our Intimates business have been sold through the end of the second quarter. And considering the anticipated gain of approximately $0.10 per share, related to assets to be sold during the second half of the year, the net impact on the full year from this discontinued business is estimated to be a loss of $0.07 per share. ", "In terms of shares outstanding, we repurchased 2.1 million shares in the quarter, thereby concluding the buyback related to utilization of proceeds and the sale of our Intimates business. The total number of shares repurchased in the second quarter was 4.1 million. ", "Now, in terms of our balance sheet and cash flow, accounts receivable were up 20%, the higher increase in AR versus our sales gain during the second quarter was due to the strong sales in our European businesses, where payment terms are substantially longer than our other businesses. In fact, our sales in Europe during the quarter increased by 33%. ", "The inventories rose 17%, it's a bit higher than our guidance for the third quarter sales increase of 12%. The difference is explained by higher levels in certain businesses to better service our customers during our upcoming heavier shipping periods. By year-end we expect inventory days to be in line or below prior year levels. ", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Debt as a percent of total capital was 20% at the end of June compared to 25% at this time last year. Obviously, our balance sheet presents us with opportunities for sales and earnings growth. And we continue to expect a very healthy year of cash flow from operations which should approximate $625 million. ", "In terms of our guidance for the rest of the year, as Mackey mentioned, we are being cautious in our outlook, we've chosen to keep our full year guidance of 12% increase in both revenues and earnings intact. Looking forward to a record third quarter with revenues and EPS expected to increase 12% and 10% respectively. And the reason EPS will grow to slightly lower rate than revenue relates to our tax rate, which will be higher in the third quarter. Last year's rate reflected some tax credits that pulled the rate down a bit. In fact, operating margin should be strong and stable in the quarter nearing the 16% level as I previously mentioned. Mackey? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, thank you Bob. That summarizes our very positive results and our very confident outlook. We will now open it up for your questions. ", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Lehman Brothers. ", "Robert S. Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, good morning. ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bob. ", "Robert S. Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "A couple of questions for you. First, overall when you look at the SG&A expenses for the quarter, can you just may be discuss, how the numbers played out versus the differences in last year versus planned. And it just seems like it came in a little bit better than expected and sort of where that performance really came from and aggregate... was it marketing? Was there a change in marketing spends or anything like that that is worth noting? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And...those kinds of changes Bob, the most important thing in the quarter was the gain on the H.I.S. transaction, had a fairly significant impact on the quarter alone. In fact it reduced the expenses by about 60 basis points, okay. So that was applied, that was a big factor. ", "Robert S. Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And can you elaborate little more on the inventory levels up 17%, you've talked about just heavy shipping and some of your customers trying to maintain it that way. Can you just maybe give us a little but more color around the products that are in there? Is it basic product, is there more of any of the fashion element product in that as well? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, no it is more basic product. And what we did was, we just peeped up the levels a bit to make sure that we were servicing the needs. Last year we could have used a bit more frankly, so again to assure service, more of that is in Outdoor as well. It's a bigger piece, so again yes, we're very comfortable. There is no issue relative to the inventories. They remain very, very clean. We just increased the levels a bit. And as I said, by the end of the year in other words, after these heavier shipping periods, by the end of the year, our days you will see better comparisons on that point in time, after these part of shipping periods. ", "Robert S. Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Operator", "And we now have a question from Brian McGough of Morgan Stanley. ", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks a lot. I guess just... I would say that I encourage you to have Fergie in your next analyst meetings. One thing I wanted to ask about is that over the past quarter, I guess Wal-Mart has cut their U.S. square footage growth from 8% down to 4%. And it sounds like, you guys now in your business are really starting to buy bit a lot of infrastructure investments over there and it's helping margins. But as you look out over another year or two years, as it relates to the U.S. Jeans space specifically, what do you think and as far as how the overall market dynamics might change? ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "In the Mass channel, Brian? ", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, yes. ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. I mean we... our target for growth in the Mass channel as well as for our domestic denim business is kind of low single-digits. And we are confident that with the team we have in place and the brands that we have in place and the opportunities we have to extend our brands to new categories that we can accomplish that, while there are market changes. And we have been doing that pretty consistently as the markets has changed and our customers have changed strategy over the last two or three years. And there have been substantial changes in the last two or three years and we have delivered that. We think we can continue to deliver that going forward. ", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "And then I guess just another question is that on the European business, I guess not only Jeanswear which is doing great, but also Outdoor. There is a currency benefit there and I guess a lot of people might think that you are just going to flow all that right through the P&L in printed and I am wondering how much of that you are doing versus how much you are going to take and actually reinvest back into the business in order to fuel growth in the outer years? ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I don't know, I'll let Bob think about it if there is a specific number. I would tell you that our emphasis in our international business is to have them be a key growth driver for us going forward and we were making substantial investments in our brands there and in owned retail to continue our growth and that is our number one priority. And as part of the international team over there, they are also responsible for Asia where we are also making substantial investments. We make healthy operating margins from our international business and... already, and as we are getting gains we are trying to pile them back and secure our future. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The only thing that I'll add to that is just a little slightly around that, the currency benefit in the quarter was about a penny a share. ", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then I guess lastly Bob, on the balance sheet I mean it just looks exceptional. We are starting to see a lot of companies now however, last year companies those are the world who from purely increasing their debt leverage even if they sacrifice rating and they are returning their capital back to shareholders and you guys are starting to go the other way I guess as your leverage comes down and down. Can you talk just about how you guys have been... if you have been thinking about that whether it be at the Board level or amongst yourselves and whether that might change at all over the upcoming 6 to 12 months? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Brianright now, as we've been very, very consistent with this, we continue to see a number of opportunities related to investing our dollars against acquisitions, again which has been what we've been saying and we continue to look at those kinds of opportunities. So at this point in time, we aim to continue our shareholders are best served, we think that our track record related to the acquisitions has proven that. So we are not, that's the way we would like to put our balance sheet to work for us against the kinds of investments that will provide us with long term top line and bottom line growth. ", "Brian McGough - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Okay guys, thanks a lot ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet Brian. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffery Edelman of UBS. ", "Jeffery Edelman - UBS Warburg L.L.C.", "Thank you. Good morning. Two areas of questions; one, Eric, you've talked about the good performance in retail overall. Could you give us some sense how your recent store openings have been performing kind of on an overall basis; in line, a little better and what your are learning from some of the opening of some of the newer types of stores? ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "That they got to... Jeff, that's a broad-based question, we are opening stores in lots of places. I will say that in total, our owned retail stores get to our targeted operating margins, that's one of your questions very quickly. So from a profitability standpoint, the stores that VF has been opening over the last few years, by and large have been successful and collectively are achieving our corporate targets for operating margins. When it comes to our performance basis, because of the kind of stores we are investing in primarily and our biggest investments have been in Jeanswear in Europe and Asia and Vans in the U.S. and in the North Face, that's where the... that's the biggest investments in stores at comp. Those stores are achieving comp store growth rates in the mid single-digits, I am sorry, mid double-digits. ", "Jeffery Edelman - UBS Warburg L.L.C.", "Okay, great, thank you. And Bob, I believe at one time you had said you were comfortable with a longer term target of long term debt to capital ratio of around 40%. As you look at your businesses and cash flow now, what do you think would be an appropriate target and then just a follow up to that, would you expect to be maintaining the current dividends payout ratio? Thank you. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Yes, Jeff you are right on the 40% and we actually will continue to believe that the 40% is the right target for us, that's how we look at it internally, but what we have also said is given our very, very strong cash generation that's for the right opportunities, we could and have, not often but have in the past levered up a bit over the 40% ratio. So we still overall think that's the right opportunity to the prior question, we are well below that at this point in time and that's obviously what creates the opportunity for us today. ", "Related to the... related to the dividend, what we've indicated there is that we will maintain our payout ratio above the 40% level. At the time of the increase, it was represented by about 44% was the payout. That was the payout level, so again committed to keeping it above 40%, so the increase should be proportionate to do that, yes. ", "Jeffery Edelman - UBS Warburg L.L.C.", "Okay thank you. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad of Credit Suisse. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Thank you. Good morning. ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "I wanted to ask about the environment you kind of referred to some of your expectations or at least what you are baking in your outlook for the rest of the year, some more cautious expectations about kind of the consumer retail spending environment. What do you seeing out there, I mean you guys are such a big company with that there are such a so many different channels and markets? Can you kind of elaborate where you are seeing strength and where you seeing weakness and what your biggest areas of turn off from an environmental perspective in terms of the spending environment? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think I got your question, you kind of faded in and out but just addressing the environment overall, we really are seeing no change in our... specific changes in our existing businesses, existing brands. We are certainly seeing and hearing as you are about the consumer confidence levels or some of their discretionary spending issues, pressures on their spending and we are hearing about retailers being cautious about inventories going into the bad schools. So those are the things that lead us to be a little more cautious, nothing really specific with our business. So as we said, very healthy so far this year and healthy as we look out for the rest of the year, feel very good about the year actually. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "So you are not seeing it but kind of baking it in from a conservative... conservatism standpoint on in terms of your outlook? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Okay. And then one follow up question on earlier question on the SG&A spend, even if you add back kind of the one-time gain on the gain on sale this quarter, it looks like you still got a bit of leverage in the SG&A and kind of in past quarters you've made comments like we are really taking this opportunity to strengthen our business to invest behind our key growth vehicles. And if you kind of look over the several quarters, you have been... that's been one of the reasons why you have not been getting leverage on your sales growth, which is great investment behind those growth areas. But just want to kind of wanted to reconcile what we saw this quarter even after you add back the gain and are you looking to get a little bit more leverage on the spend going forward? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we did in this quarter and again this is a little bit of an unusual quarter. As you know, it's our lowest revenue quarter for the year. But I can tell you in the... we actually drove by a higher percent in those areas that are experiencing higher growth rates. So from a mix standpoint, there was actually about an 80 basis point increase in the SG&A relationship, just caused by the mix. So we are continuing to invest heavily in those opportunities. But I can't tell you those just that our rate in the quarter in other words more on heritage business was down a bit. ", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Perfect thanks. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Operator", "And we now have a question form Kate McShane of Citigroup. ", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Good morning. Thank you. Is the H.I.S. divestiture sign that you're looking for other opportunities to divest brands? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Other opportunities for what, I'm sorry. ", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "I am sorry, to divest brands. Should we read any thing into the H.I.S. divestiture as maybe a slight change in strategy to look as divesting more brands out of your portfolio? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It was getting a lot bit of a broken transmission here, but as far as divestitures we continue to look across our businesses. We certainly don't see any large pieces of our business now that aren't performing. As we've talked about all of our businesses are performing, but within those businesses we look such as the H.I.S. brand that we recently talked about. We continue to look at smaller pieces of the business that aren't performing and if the return on investment required to get them up to our performance levels, we will continue to have some divestitures, but nothing that we see major at this point. ", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Virginia Genereux of Merrill Lynch. ", "Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch", "Hi this is Rick Patel in for Virginia. Thanks for taking my question. So, for EPS in the third quarter, I know you're expecting an increase of 10% over last year but, if I recall correctly, last year you're opening up some distribution centers for North Face. So I would have thought that there would have been an easy compare there so, taking into account there is a tax rate issue, are there any other investments going on in any particularly areas? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So you are speaking specifically related to the margin or to the EPS increase. The EPS increase, just to speak to that, is being held down by some tax credits that we had in last year's third quarter, okay. So otherwise, you'd see a stronger comparison on EPS line, just $0.03 or $0.04 worth. So again these were credits realized and recognized in the last year's quarter that don't repeat in this year's third quarter. ", "Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. And can you talk a little bit about idle capacity, your manufacturing centers, does your outlook take into account any idle capacity as retail may be pushes back some orders or changes some of their buying patterns? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, what happens relative to our own manufacturing, we actually use... we use other pieces of our total sourcing scheme to balance out our needs. So we keep our plants running full, so if we see any reduction that will come out from somewhere else, not in our own plants. ", "Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. And just lastly, can you just give us an update on the door count specifically Vans and North Face? ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "On the numbers of doors that we have? ", "Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch", "Yes. ", "Eric C. Wiseman - President and Chief Operating Officer", "I will tell you that for this year, I am not sure I have a total door count here in front of me. I know that for this year, we are opening 19 Vans doors this year and we are going to open an additional 6 North Face doors, bringing that total count to around 24. For the full year, we are going to grow about 600 doors. ", "Rick Patel - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We have a question now from Jim Duffy of Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Thank you, good morning. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning Jim. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Couple of questions on the Jeanswear business. Can you speak specific to the inventories in the Jeanswear business, Bob? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the inventories overall in Jeanswear actually are in pretty good shape and relatively consistent with where they have been. So again, no... really not an issue there, and no issues relative to quality of the inventories or any thing like that. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Okay. And then relative to your Jeanswear sourcing, there was a recent report that you are closing a Malta plant. Can you speak of the geographic mix of your sourcing as it stands now and any opportunities for the consolidation of sourcing going forward? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. That the Malta plant was totally producing for our international jeans business. So, that production will shift to some lower cost locations actually around the globe. We try to spread that out pretty well. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Is there a lot of opportunity remaining for that to continue to happen with other plants around the world? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Not so much actually, not so much from that standpoint relative to our owned manufacturing. At this point in time, we are pretty pleased with what we have in our... our owned plants continue to give us a benefit over opportunities or cost that are available elsewhere. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Okay. And then Bob, you mentioned some thing that was interesting, the impact of your international growth on the working capital metrics, particularly their receivables? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "As this international continues to grow as a percent in the mix, would you expect that to continue to have an inflationary impact on DSOs or is there some offset there that can help you work down receivables? ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it was a particularly strong quarter in terms of our European growth, so we had an unusually strong impact overall. As our European business grows, however it would push the days up a bit. But again, the difference that we saw in this quarter, given the 33% growth in Europe was unusual, it was stronger than we'd expect to see on a go forward basis. But yes, overall the days as our European business does growing, becomes bigger for the overall mix and we have said that we expect our international businesses could represent 30% of our total in just a couple of days or days could expand a bit. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Very good. Thanks very much. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You bet. ", "Operator", "We have a question now from Angelique Dab of Nollenberger Capital Partners. ", "Angelique Dab - Nollenberger Capital Partners", "Good morning. ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning. ", "Angelique Dab - Nollenberger Capital Partners", "As you look to the back half of the year, what's the percentage of the business that you expect to do on a replenishment basis and what is your assumption for that replenishment sales incorporated in the top line guidance that we received today? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "As we look at replenishment overall, we are somewhere in the 50% area with our replenishment in our heritage businesses and then a lot of our lifestyle businesses are much less from a replenishment standpoint, more a one-time order basis. ", "Robert K. Shearer - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But not a significant change anticipated over the second half of the year versus what we are seeing. ", "Angelique Dab - Nollenberger Capital Partners", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Robert Samuels from J. P. Morgan ", "Robert Samuels - J. P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning. Can you just talk quickly about the current acquisition environment and sort of how you guys view things going forward? Are you still looking to increase your exposure in the direct business? ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, as far as the environment continuation of the same would be the way I would describe it, still very competitive, still lot of private equity money out there, at the same time we do feel that there are opportunities that fit us extremely well. Our focus continues to be lifestyle brands, particularly brands that are targeted in the areas that we don't currently have a strong position in either categories, in the Outdoor or Sportswear area. We also are looking for global brands, we are looking for brands that have growth potential, we are not just bulking it up, but we are looking for brands that can grow at half single to low double-digit rates after the acquisition. And direct... either direct capabilities or the potential to be a direct to consumer brand is another criteria we look at. ", "Robert Samuels - J. P. Morgan", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "And at this time we have no further questions from the phone line. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Mackey McDonald, for any closing or final remarks. ", "Mackey J. McDonald - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks for joining us today. As I said, we are very pleased with the results and very confident about the future of the VF Corporation.

Please be aware that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana.", "Jean Fontana", "Good afternoon and thank you for participating in VF Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2008 conference call. By now you should have received today\u2019s earnings press release. If not, please call 203-682-8200 and we\u2019ll get you a copy immediately following the call. ", "Hosting our call this afternoon is Mr. Eric Wiseman, President and CEO of VF Corp.", "Before we begin, we\u2019d like to remind participants that certain statements included in today\u2019s remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. ", "Important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss another record quarter for VF Corporation. Revenue growth of 10% was at the top end of our guidance, and earnings per share growth of 14% was actually quite a bit better.", "Our Outdoor Coalition delivered another outstanding quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Image wear results were solid and contemporary brands results were right on track.  These results illustrate the power of VF\u2019s business model, strong brand and a lot of diversity in terms of products, geographies and channels of distribution.  ", "I\u2019m going to confine my remarks today to the areas that I believe are of most interest to you and then I\u2019ll turn things over to Bob Shearer who will provide more detail in numbers. ", "My first comment is about the current environment.  Those of you on our February call remember how I said then that business was very challenging out there and that we did not expect any meaningful recovery in 2008.  The bad news was that we were right and the good news is that we were right and planned accordingly. ", "We\u2019re still seeing lots of promotional activity out there exacerbated by cooler than normal weather in much of the country which means that seasonal goods are moving very slowly.  We are not seeing a material change in order cancellations and delayed shipments but retailers are tightening up the pipeline and becoming even more conservative in their inventory planning and orders. ", "Against that backdrop we feel very good about our first quarter performance.  As we noted in the release our international and retail businesses have powerful momentum and are working as a buffer against the difficulties of today\u2019s environment particularly on the domestic side.  We expect this momentum will continue which makes us comfortable with maintaining our annual guidance for 2008 with revenue and earnings per share expected to increase 9-10% respectively. ", "My second comment relates to our jeans wear results in the quarter specifically on the domestic side. Given the current environment in both the mass and mid-tier channels of distribution it may not be surprising that our jeans business was down in the first quarter.  Half of that revenue decline was due to disappointing over-the-counter performance driven in part by consumers migrating to the very lowest priced products.  ", "The other half was due to a combination of inventory reductions at retail, the shift in timing of certain programs in both our Mast and Lee businesses and the slow start to seasonal products that I just mentioned.  ", "I also remind you that we posted very solid gains in both our Mast and Lee businesses in last year\u2019s first quarter so we are up against tough comps.  On the plus side we are encouraged that we are at least holding our share of market in most areas.  In fact we are seeing market share gains in our Lee business. ", "The first quarter is not representative of what we expect for our jeans business for the year and we are looking forward to better results for jeans wear in the coming quarters as we indicated in the release.  Overall revenue comparisons for our global jeans business should turn positive starting next quarter and continue in the second half.  ", "While our domestic business is expected to run flat to down slightly for the next three quarters as the difficult macro environment continues, we do expect continued growth in our international jeans business.  On the domestic side we have a large array of programs lined up for the second quarter and beyond including integrated new product launches and door expansion programs that have been tested and proven successful.  ", "Internationally we expect growth to be fueled by our continued expansion into China and India as well as an additional seasonal delivery in Europe. ", "My third comment relates to our second quarter guidance.  While our full year guidance remains intact the second quarter is a bit of an anomaly this year in part because VF is becoming a more seasonal company due to our acquired companies and more retail revenues. ", "A few key points I want to make about the quarter.  First, our businesses remain very healthy as evidenced by the 10% revenue growth we expect in the quarter half of which will be organic.  In fact with the exception of sports wear we are looking forward to growth across our coalition with another exceptionally strong quarter in Outdoors.  ", "Second, higher levels of investment to support future growth particularly in Outdoor will have a disproportionate impact on profitability in our second quarter which is our seasonally lowest period.  Outdoor revenues should continue to grow at a double-digit rate but operating margins will be below those reported in last year\u2019s second quarter as we continue to make investments necessary to support the continued growth of our strong Outdoor businesses. ", "Third, bear in mind that last year\u2019s second quarter included $0.04 benefit from the sale of the HIS trademarks which we obviously will not have in this year\u2019s second quarter. ", "Fourth the acquisition of Seven for All Mankind and Lucy will be diluted to the tune of about $0.02 in the quarter. ", "My last comment relates to our outlook for the second half and the full year.  We stated in the release that we expect healthy results in the second half of the year.  Revenues continue to grow at a rate of around 8% with double-digit earnings per share growth.  These results are not contingent upon any meaningful recovery in the economy or consumer spending.  They are contingent upon our ability to execute well defined and developed plans for each of our businesses and I\u2019m confident we will be able to do just that. ", "Now let\u2019s hear from Bob Shearer. ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Thanks Eric.  Let\u2019s start at the top.  As Eric indicated our revenue growth of 10% was at the top end of our guidance of 8-10% growth.  We are very pleased with the continued momentum in Outdoor, the solid performance in Image wear and the contribution to revenues from our new contemporary brands coalition. ", "As noted in the earnings release our international and owned retail businesses continue to be big growth drivers for us.  Our international revenues rose 21% with double-digit increases in our North Face, Vans, Napapijri, Kipling and Reef international businesses.  In jeans wear international growth is being drive by gains in Europe and Asia as well as strong performance in Mexico and Latin America.  Not only are our international operations big top line growth contributors but during the first quarter they also drove significant profit gains from their higher than average profit margins. ", "Retail revenues grew 24% with our Vans, North Face, Kipling, Napapijri, Wrangler and Lee brands each growing their retail businesses at double-digit rates.  We ended the quarter with 641 owned retail stores opening 15 new stores during the quarter. ", "For the full year we expect to open about 100 new stores with a significant number of those scheduled for the second quarter.  These are all important factors in our growth expectations. ", "Looking now at total revenues, favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed to the increase for the quarter accounting for $56 million or 3% of the revenue growth in the quarter and adding $0.09 to our earnings per share.  Revenue contribution from acquisitions, Majestic, Seven for All Mankind, lucy and Eagle Creek was $141 million in the quarter, clearly a significant contributor or our revenue gain for the quarter. ", "Our organic growth was lower than that experienced during recent quarters, however our plans indicate more normal levels of organic growth beginning in the second quarter.  ", "Our gross margin jumped 160 basis points to over 45% in the first quarter. Mix accounted for 70 basis points of the improvement with the remainder resulting from efficiency improvements particularly in our U.S. jeans business. ", "SG&A as a percent of sales rose by a smaller amount, 130 basis points, which includes a 70 basis point impact relating to the higher SG&A ratios of our expanding retail operations.  First quarter SG&A also includes the expenses related to the Nautica Women\u2019s sportswear exit.  ", "Operating margins increased in our outdoor and jeans wear businesses.  Our contemporary brands coalition reported operating margins of over 15% which also contributed to the overall higher margin levels in the quarter.  Despite higher gross margins for the quarter, sportswear operating margins were lower for reasons I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, while image wear margins were also below prior year levels due solely to the inclusion of a full quarter\u2019s worth of Majestic results. ", "Now as to other details specific to individual coalition results I think Eric pretty well covered the jeans wear results so I\u2019d like to fill in a few more details related to sportswear\u2019s first quarter.  Both revenues and operating income for sports wear were below prior year levels.  In our release we noted the primary factors affecting revenues were first the decision by Nautica customers last year to reduce their product assortment, second lower sales of Nautica products to the off price channel.  We also noted we recently decided to exit our women\u2019s wholesale sports wear business.  ", "Given the consolidation in the department store channel and the challenging environment in the women\u2019s better sports wear category we weren\u2019t able to gain enough critical mass in this business and the expenses to support it have been pressuring profitability.  This action resulted in expenses in the quarter of $3 million and helps to explain the decline in sports wear\u2019s operating income and margins.  Decision will favorably impact sports wear margins in the second half of this year and next year as well.  In fact we indicated that sports wear margins should recover to double-digit margins in the second half of this year.  ", "Now I should point out as well that Nautica continues to have healthy women\u2019s sleep wear, and swim wear businesses and that we will continue to offer women\u2019s apparel in select Nautica retail stores and through our eCommerce site. ", "Wrapping up on sports wear we are pleased with the growth that we are seeing in John Varvatos and Kipling U.S. businesses.  ", "Interest expense rose to $22 million from $14 million in last year\u2019s quarter related to acquisition borrowings.  The tax rate was 33.3% in the quarter, a point below last year\u2019s rate and is indicative of what we expect for the full year.  Our tax rate has been declining as the result of our lower tax rates in our international businesses. ", "Income from continuing operations increased 11% while eps rose 14% on 3% fewer average shares outstanding in the quarter.  ", "Turning on to the balance sheet.  Inventories rose 13% in the first quarter.  As is often the case with our acquired companies inventory days within our most recent acquisitions are well above VF averages.  Inventory levels within our existing businesses increased 6% very much in line with organic revenue growth expected for the second quarter.  Obviously the reduction in inventory levels in our recently acquired businesses represents an opportunity for cash generation by year end. ", "Speaking of cash generation cash generated from operations was negative for the quarter which is typical for our first quarter as we build working capital to service our seasonally stronger quarters ahead.  We continue to expect that we will generate about $700 million in cash from operations for the full year.  Our debt to capital ratio remains low at about 29% and that is 25% net of cash on the balance sheet. ", "Now I\u2019d like to provide some additional color on the second quarter.  As indicated in the press release we expect to see continued strong top line growth of approximately 10% with about half the increase due to acquisitions and half from organic growth.  We expect to see the continuation of gross margin improvement in the quarter which should be up by about 100 basis points.  However, due to increases in the relationship of SG&A expenses to revenues and the fact that 2007 second quarter included a $7.5 million gain related to the sale of a business that is not repeated in 2008 our operating margin and earnings will decline.  Our operating margins are expected to be just above the 9% level in the second quarter while earnings per share should approximate $0.80 per share compared with the $0.93 in last year\u2019s second quarter. ", "Profitability in the second quarter will be impacted by a number of factors with the single largest factor being heavier spending within our global outdoor businesses to support continued long term growth.  Now that includes investments related to expansion into new geographic areas, new retail store openings and an increase in our global advertising spend.  In addition outdoors\u2019 distribution expense as a percent to sales will increase as we take actions to ensure on time deliveries during the heavier shipping periods of the second half.  Also keep in mind the second quarter for outdoor businesses represents only 18% of the total year\u2019s revenues.  That means that the investments during the quarter stand out more than they would in other quarters due to seasonality factors. ", "I want to be clear that while the second quarter will be impacted by the spending levels within our outdoor businesses, these businesses remain very strong.  In fact that is the reason we are willing to make the investments we have outlined.  Though operating margins for outdoor in the second quarter could be down 300 basis points, full year operating margins for this coalition should improve by 50-100 basis points and that includes the incremental spend during the second quarter. ", "Now there are two other factors impacting the second quarter although to a much lesser extent than outdoor.  First, our sports wear business will again be up against the tougher comps of last year\u2019s second quarter.  As in the first quarter the loss of revenues from a major customer is impacting the expense to sales relationships within this coalition.  Revenue and profit comparisons for the second half of the year will improve within our sports wear coalition.  While first half revenues are expected to decline by about 7%, second half revenues should increase by 2-3% due to easier comps versus last year and improved assortments in our retail stores. ", "Profitability improvements will result from the exit of the women\u2019s business and improved performance within our own retail business where mark down activity was severe during the latter part of 2007.  Our buying practices for 2008 in terms of quantities and assortments will result in lower risk for our store operations. ", "In addition, while our contemporary brands were accretive for the first quarter, the second quarter for these businesses represents only 12% of the full year revenues and this seasonality impact will result in these brands being diluted in the second quarter by about $0.02 per share.  Again this is a seasonality issue related to the changing relationships of quarterly results within VF.  The full year contribution related to these new businesses is expected to be about $0.10 per share. ", "Finally related to the second quarter it is important to understand that one we did expect that the second quarter would reflect the changing seasonality of our business as I have just outlined, two the heavier spending in outdoor was planned and three our full year projections continue to indicate improvement in our operating margins of about 40 basis points. ", "Now a few comments on our full year expectations.  As indicated in the press release we are confirming our full year guidance of 9% top line growth and 10% growth in earnings per share.  As Eric indicated the environment isn\u2019t getting any easier but taking into account current conditions we are confident in confirming this strong performance. ", "Eric? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Thanks Bob.  Before we take your questions let me close by highlighting why we are so confident in our 2008 guidance.  First, our projections include the benefits of new store roll outs and the strong performance of our retail operations including the anticipated improvement in profitability that results from our growing retail scale and higher mix of full price stores to outlet stores. ", "Second, our projections include a continuation of the strong growth and profitability of our international operations as seen in the first quarter. ", "Third, our forecast anticipates the continuation of the growth within our outdoor businesses both in the U.S. as well as overseas based on existing bookings. ", "Fourth, our jeans wear revenues are expected to stabilize so their annual revenue in 2008 should approximately 2007.  We have demonstrated in the first quarter we can maintain and improve the profitability of these businesses in this challenging environment. ", "Fifth, our sports wear comparisons should improve to a level where annual revenues and earnings are about equal to prior year amounts as we comp against a particularly challenging second half to 2007 and benefit from the exit of the women\u2019s sports wear. ", "Finally, our contemporary brands should continue to provide strong contribution to our 2008 results. ", "We\u2019d be delighted to take your questions. ", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "If anyone in our telephone audience would like to ask a question simply press the * key followed by the digit 1 on your touchtone telephone.  Again that is *1 if you would like to ask a question.  If you are on a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is disengaged.  It can block your signal from reaching us.  Again that is *1. ", "We\u2019ll take our first question from Robert Drbul with Lehman Brothers. ", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Hi good afternoon.  Eric I guess the question that I have for you\u2026you guys touched on it a little bit.  Can you elaborate more on the pick up on the spend on the outdoor side in terms of exactly what you are going to be spending the money on?  Can you put any metrics around the timing of it as to why you are doing it right now?  Just maybe elaborate a little bit more from that side. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Yeah, I don\u2019t have, Bob, specific dollar amounts by initiative.  I will talk about the text of initiatives for you though.  We have significant new store openings in outdoor in the second quarter that require immediate investment.  Those stores we know our outdoor stores work for us and will deliver for us in the second half and beyond.  Second we are launching the North Face eCommerce site on August 1.  The North Face marketing site goes live in June and we\u2019re stepping up and investing to create what we think is going to be a killer eCommerce site for VF Corporation.  We are also investing in marketing in both Vans and in North Face.  We are investing in both people and in advertising budget in this quarter to drive our business in the second half. Those are the three front end oriented things.  Last, as you can imagine with the growth of the North Face it strains our distribution center\u2019s operations to get the goods out in the third quarter.  We move so much volume in the third quarter. We are bringing staff on board in the second quarter to get organized and prepared to make the shipments we know we can make in the third quarter because we are going to have the inventory and we definitely have the orders. ", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay.  Great.  Just a follow-up for Bob.  On the foreign exchange and the $0.09 for the quarter, how should we think about that going forward in terms of this new guidance?  What do you anticipate or how have you factored that into your full year guidance? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Bob we have taken a pretty cautious view frankly relative specifically to the Euro which is by far what impacts us more than anything else.  As a matter of fact the $0.09 actually captures most of the benefit that we expect to see for the full year.  Again, if the Euro stays anywhere close to the $1.60 mark which is where we are today there is obviously some upside there.  So we have taken a cautious view.  Again, nearly all of it\u2026The $0.09 represents nearly all of the benefit that we have anticipated for the full year. ", "", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Great.  Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeffery Edelman with UBS Warburg.  ", "Jeffery Edelman \u2013 UBS Warburg ", "Good afternoon.  Eric could you address the jeans wear business a little more in terms of you said it was trending down to some of your lower price points as well as some retailer cut backs and inventories.  A lot of this has been a replenishment business anyways.  But the stores reduced their stocks and now you are at a lower level and you expect sales to be better.  Can you talk about the price point issue and why things should level off as we get into the second and third quarters? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Sure.  We do think that some of what happened in the first quarter will not be repeated.  Let me talk about those things first.  First, we did have the retailers did reduce their inventory as consumer trends got more and more negative in the first quarter.  The inventory expectations declined and there was less replenishment because there was less consumer take away and people were aiming at lower inventory targets.  So that definitely impacted us and we think we are at stable inventory levels now. ", "Second, it was cold out there and the seasonal businesses across all channels are off to a very slow start this year.  It will get warm and that stuff will sell but it did get off to a lower start.  We think the combination of those two events was responsible for about half of our decline in business in the Americas.  ", "On the other side of it there is just plain consumer slow down out there that has taken part of the other pieces of the slow down and on top of that in times like this some consumers flock to more value price points.  That happens in every channel of distribution where people that were shopping in upper scale department stores that are moving downtown, there are people from mid tier that are moving to mass and there are people in mass that are going to the very lowest price point.  As that happens and people go to the very lowest price point in the mass channel that is not where our strong brands exist nor where we want them to exist. So that has affected us as well. ", "Did that help you? ", "Jeffery Edelman \u2013 UBS Warburg ", "Yes it does.  Bob, for you\u2026is the first quarter a seasonal low for seven in terms of profitability?  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Actually Jeff the second quarter is more so.  The first quarter is stronger than the second quarter. ", "Jeffery Edelman \u2013 UBS Warburg ", "Because based on the numbers you threw out in terms of the contributions to sales as well as operating profit it looked as though those businesses had a roughly 15% operating margin in the first quarter which I believe is a good bit below what we were looking at expectations for the year so is there something else that might have depressed the profitability of those numbers? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "No.  You have to remember Jeff that when we talk about the acquisitions it does include Seven for All Mankind, it includes lucy and it includes Majestic.  Alright\u2026Majestic wasn\u2019t owned in prior years.  So it includes all of those pieces. ", "Jeffery Edelman \u2013 UBS Warburg ", "Okay.  I\u2019ll just\u2026.thanks.

Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing internationally and that a large portion of your growth was a strong result internationally and we are hearing Western Europe in particular is getting significantly weaker.  Does your guidance incorporate a weaker international environment and can you quantify how much exposure you have in some of the Western European countries?  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "The good news for us is our international business is becoming more and more diverse as well.  First of all we have seen a modest slow down in the Western European markets and that is reflected in our guidance for the year and in all of our forecasts.  The flip side of that is in India and China and Russia and Latin and South America we are seeing strong growth so all of that comes together in our international numbers and it is all reflected in our forecast including some new softness in Western Europe.  We have captured all that in our numbers, we think. ", "Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay.  Separate question\u2026can you quantify what the backlog was for the North Face for 2008?

When you gave guidance last, I think it was in February on a call, you reiterated it today and it seems to be the environment has probably gotten a little bit worse since then.  Can you help us understand exactly what your macro expectations are for those second, third and fourth quarters?  Do you think the environment or are you assuming the environment is going to stay this bad?  Are you assuming it is going to get materially worse or maybe improve a little bit?  Can you help us kind of get some broad perspective to understand what is imbedded in your guidance? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "I think in general we assume it is going to stay this bad.

That is a good answer.  That is helpful.  On the women\u2019s bit with Nautica you are kind of walking away from that business.  Can you help us understand\u2026women\u2019s has been such a tough category for so many companies for the last couple of years but it is such a huge part of the part of the branded apparel world out there\u2026can you help us understand what is your exposure to the women\u2019s side of the business?  What do you see as the opportunities there either in your existing brands or in acquisitions and how to increase, if you want to increase, that exposure? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Well it is a complex question and we have to talk about that question from a lot of angles.  For example in our Lee business in the mid-tier is very strong with women\u2019s and we are gaining share in mid-tier channel with our women\u2019s business.  The same is a strong women\u2019s business in the mass channel as well.  The North Face has a growing and strong women\u2019s business in both sports wear and outer wear.  I think the traditional department store kind of better sports wear lines are really, really struggling and I think that is where you see the other companies kind of really struggle.  We struggled to get a foot hold in that space while we launched the women\u2019s Nautica initiative into what probably couldn\u2019t have been worse timing in that space in the department store pad. ", "The other side of that\u2026as I said we are having some success with women\u2019s.  We think our businesses like Seven for All Mankind are having terrific growth in the contemporary space with women\u2019s and that sector \u2013 the contemporary space seems to be growing and we don\u2019t see that slowing down much.

One last question\u2026the switch to lower price point product in the jeans business, are you saying that there are some customers who are trading out of the Riders and Wrangler and Lee brands to private label?

I think within mid-tier there are people moving to Lee where we have a lower price point in that channel relative to the competition and we seem to be\u2026not seem to be we are gaining share.  We are gaining share partly because we have great products and partly because of the pressure on price. ", "In the mass channel there has been some movement to the lowest price points.  It is a very minor movement.  It is not like there is a mass herding mentality thing going on there but my guess would be kind of low single-digit erosion from us moving towards those price points.

", "Virginia Genereux \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.  Hey Eric and Bob and Cindy.  How about\u2026if you guys can talk about any seasonality of your international business?  It was 27% last year\u2026I think you said 36% in the first quarter which is a pretty nice growth rate.  Is it pretty consistent across the quarters or do you have quarters that are bigger internationally? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "We do have quarters that are bigger and actually as a percent of total\u2026now that\u2019s the way I will speak to it, Virginia, it is not necessarily dollars but it is a percent to our total business in each quarter.  Actually the first quarter is one of the larger quarters.  So I mentioned 36%.  Actually the second quarter that declines somewhat.  It will be closer to a 27% level.  For the full year right now we are looking for our international businesses being about 30%.  So there is some seasonality there as well. ", "Virginia Genereux \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s great.  I think you said to Bob Drbul that you have a pretty conservative currency forecast.  It doesn\u2019t sound like you think the Euro is staying at $1.60 or whatever?

So the second half we just have it planned a lot closer to the $1.40, which is not all that far from where we were last year.  Again we are just not building the kind of relationships we are seeing today.  ", "Virginia Genereux \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s good.  I think you are low.  You\u2019ll take it anyway.  How about Eric, what would you say as you think about organic growth you mentioned some dynamics that pressured organic growth\u2026I think you said you are looking for 5% or so in the second quarter.  How going forward what do you think we should think about as the rate for organic growth for the portfolio and the contributors to that? That is a tricky one. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "That is a complex question.  When we gave our guidance for the future of VF a few months ago we said that we think we can get 67% organic growth.  We absolutely still believe that.  There will be quarters and times when we exceed that over the next five years and there will be quarters and times when it is more challenging.  But we absolutely think that is the kind of numbers we can post with the brand portfolio that we have.  It is really complicated Virginia to get more specific than that because you have to speak to every market, every brand and every situation.  We have businesses that are far exceeding that right now; our outdoor businesses and our contemporary businesses are delivering organic growth at a much stronger rate than that in this particular quarter.  Our domestic jeans wear business delivered at a much lower rate than that.  Part of that is ongoing and part of that we think will go away. ", "Virginia Genereux \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  That is helpful.  How did you guys sort of manage the inventories so well, Bob?  Historically there have been rare occasions where a slow down in replenishment would kind of back up on you guys in your own manufacturing facilities.  It doesn\u2019t seem like\u2026if your kind of organic inventories were up six or seven and currencies were probably a big contributor to that\u2026it doesn\u2019t seem like that is an issue.  How do you manage the inventory that well kind of in your own facilities and at Nautica for that matter?  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "You are absolutely right, Virginia.  It really relates to taking a cautious view in the environment and you are right.  The point there is when you look at the jeans wear profitability, a challenged quarter to be sure top line, we did a good job of actually improving the profitability a bit.  Perhaps you are right on.  A lot of that does have to do with controlling those inventories.  So we did.  We took a very cautious look in terms of building inventories and if we have to chase a bit we will.

Those roll outs didn\u2019t happen in the first quarter but they will happen in the second and third quarters.  The other thing that will not be happening to us we don\u2019t think is we won\u2019t be going through the inventory reduction that we went through in the first quarter to get the inventory platform we are at right now.

", "Robert Shearer", "", "Right now it is about 60% full price \u2013 50-60% full price.  So 40-50% outlet. ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Got it.  Okay.  That\u2019s great.  Thanks a lot.  All the best. ", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Brad Stephens with Morgan Keegan. ", "Brad Stephens \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Hey, good afternoon.  Two quick ones.  Bob can you walk us through the third quarter and fourth quarter just directionally if you expect the back half up 15% is it more weighted towards one quarter or the other? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "It is\u2026I tell you it is pretty consistent\u2026the growth is fairly consistent in third and fourth quarters so given the seasonality overall with those businesses historically not a lot of change. ", "Brad Stephens \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Okay.  Second I think you said in your last call that your Vans bookings were kind of flat in the first half and you expected to see an improvement as the year progressed.  Can you give us an idea if you did see that improvement? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Yeah.  We did in fact.  Van\u2019s had a better first quarter than we thought they were going to have. ", "Brad Stephens \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "In going to the back\u2026the rest of the year?  Are you concerned about space? ", "Robert Shearer ", "", "I don\u2019t have an advanced forecast for the year in front of me but I believe it is up from our original plans. ", "Brad Stephens \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Alright thanks. ", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll hear from Eric Tracy with BB&T Capital Markets.  ", "Eric Tracy \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Good afternoon.  I just wanted to follow-up on the input calls and just general macro weakness Eric or Bob if you could maybe just talk about the potential levers that you have had to pull sort of within the supply chain or some sourcing initiatives that you could implement to extract margins going forward? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Well as we have historically done we are very, very careful relative to where we place goods so we try never to get over weighted in any one country. So that has been very, very good for us.  For example we are not over weighted in China where we are seeing some cost inflation to be sure of.  So what we try to do is keep a more flexible approach to our sourcing and that has worked pretty well for us. ", "Eric Tracy \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Is there anything within specific coalitions that have more opportunity to again sort of extract some margins for sourcing than others I guess is maybe what I\u2019m trying to get at. ", "Robert Shearer", "", "I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily coalition by coalition.  What I would say is that some of our newer coalitions and newer businesses still aren\u2019t quite as efficient as our heritage businesses where we have engineered our own plants in many cases and also taken those same benefits to our sourcing partners.  So we do continue to see some opportunity there.  A little bit more in our lifestyle businesses I guess is what I\u2019m saying rather than our heritage businesses. ", "Eric Tracy \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Fair enough.  Thanks guys.  ", "Operator", "", "At this time we have no further questions.  Mr. Wiseman I\u2019ll hand the conference back to you for any closing comments. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Sure.  Thank you for joining us and I\u2019ll make a quick closing comment.  Earlier this year we talked about guidance for the year of 9% earnings growth, 9% revenue growth and 10% earnings per share growth and we are very encouraged by the progress we have made in the first quarter delivering 10% revenue growth and 14% earnings per share growth.  We are also completely committed to making investments in the second quarter behind what has been our best growth story outdoor.  We are going to spend the money we need to spend to support this business and we know when we do that we will deliver a year that will do exactly what we promised; 9% revenue growth, 10% earnings per share growth.  ", "Thanks so much for joining us. ", "Operator", "", "That will conclude our conference.  Thank you all for your participation today.  We do hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I will turn the conference over to Jean Fontana.  ", "Jean Fontana", "", "Thanks for participating in VF Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2008 conference call.  By now you should have received today\u2019s press release.  If not please call (203) 682-8200 and we\u2019ll get you a copy immediately following this call.  Hosting the call this afternoon is Eric Wiseman, President and CEO of VF.  ", "Before we begin we would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today\u2019s remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in documents filed by the company with the SEC. ", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "I am delighted to be here to discuss another record quarter in both revenues and earnings per share for VF Corporation.  As I have done in the past I will keep my comments confined to those areas we think are of the greatest interest to our audience today and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob who will provide his comments on the financial results. ", "My first comment relates to the overall environment and VF\u2019s performance within that environment.  There continues to be a huge amount of concern out there about how the rest of the year will play out, speculation about conditions deteriorating even further and skepticism about companies\u2019 ability to meet let alone beat their numbers.  ", "Now all along we have shared this concern.  From the beginning of the year we have talked about how we expect the difficult conditions to persist throughout the year and yes conditions have been even more difficult than we could have foreseen and we are affected by this environment.  We have areas of our business that have not performed as strongly as we had planned, as all of you are aware.  ", "Adding to the picture is rising cost inflation.  In response we have had to tighten our belts and cut costs, buckle down on inventory and focus in an even more disciplined way on our execution in every area.  Make no mistake, it is tough out there but it is in times like these that the VF business model really proves itself.  No, we are not immune to what is going on in the market but we did deliver 11% top line growth and much better than expected earnings in the second quarter.  After carefully reviewing our plans for the back half of the year we are confident in our ability to achieve 2008 revenues of approximately $7.8 billion, an increase just over 9% and we have increased our earnings per share growth target from 10% to 12%. ", "Now there are several reasons why we continue to perform well in today\u2019s environment.  It starts with having the right brands.  We have been truly fortunate to have made some great acquisitions and to make these acquisitions pay off for us.  Brands like the North Face which chalked up a 40% increase in revenues this quarter or brands like Vans up 14%.  We also have great heritage brands like Wrangler that continue to generate strong profit and cash flow.  ", "We continue to invest in new brands that have a very bright future like Seven for All Mankind, Lucy, Kipling and John Varvatos.  Most recently we purchased 1/3 of the shares of Mo Industries which owns the Splendid and Ella Moss brands.  We have an option to acquire the remainder of the business early next year which would allow us to bring two more great brands into our company. ", "The second strength of VF\u2019s model is our diversity.  We embrace diversity.  Diversity in brands, diversity in channel distribution and perspectives and geographies and we have demonstrated we can successfully manage all the complexity that comes with it.  Two important elements of our diversity that are proving particularly beneficial to us this year are international and owned retail.  As you saw in the release our international revenues rose 23% in the quarter with 29% growth in our international outdoor business and 14% growth in our international jeans business. ", "Even excluding the benefit of foreign currency translation our international revenues were up a solid 8%.  A question I expect many of you have relates to what we are seeing today in our international markets.  There is no question that there are pockets of weaknesses overseas and that conditions are more difficult now than they were at the beginning of the year.  ", "Again, we are fortunate that we have such strong brands that continue to attract consumers and we are fortunate that our investments to build businesses in emerging markets such as Asia, Russia and South America are paying off helping to offset more challenging conditions in parts of Europe.  ", "We expect these soft conditions to persist.  We also believe our international business can grow 17% in the second half of the year and will be up 19% for the full year.  Also noted in the release was the fact our retail revenues were up 15% in the quarter.  We continue to be extremely pleased by how strongly many of our store retail concepts are performing.  The North Face and Vans stores in particular are experiencing strong retail sales growth driven by both new store openings and healthy comp store increases.  ", "We also noted we are seeing double-digit retail revenue growth in our Kipling, Napapijri, John Varvatos and Lee brand retail stores.  The first half of 2008 we opened 38 stores across our brands and we anticipate opening over 90 stores in the full year.  For the second half of the year we anticipate continued strong growth in our retail revenues of over 20%.  ", "Brands and diversity are important components of our model.  Another is execution.  I will quote our Chairman, Mackey McDonald, who has repeatedly said, \u201cWhile brilliant ideas are not uncommon, brilliant execution is rare.\u201d  I\u2019m extremely proud of our associates\u2019 success in executing our growth strategy.  The VF of today bears little resemblance to the VF of a decade ago because we not only laid out a plan to transform our business model, we executed it.  Today in extremely difficult business conditions we continue to execute.  ", "As I look at the balance of the year I am cautious and know it will be far from easy.  I also remain confident about our company\u2019s prospects not only for this year but the years to come as well. ", "Now let\u2019s hear from Bob Shearer on the quarter\u2019s financials.  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "We included a fair amount of detail in today\u2019s release so I\u2019ll keep my comments to just the highlights.  Starting at the top we achieved an 11% increase in revenues in the quarter which was actually a bit better than our guidance of 10%.  Once again, outdoor momentum provided us with upside in the quarter and image wear also contributed to the better than expected performance.  ", "We indicated we expected a 100 basis point improvement in gross margins in the quarter and that is pretty much where we came out.  In terms of operating margins we did achieve better than expected operating margins in the quarter which contributed to the better than expected earnings per share gain.  ", "Now you will recall last quarter we talked about our expectations for operating margins around 9% and that outdoor margins in particular were going to be down from the prior year\u2019s quarter due to spending in a variety of areas.  Outdoor margins in fact declined only slightly in the quarter with a decline due mostly to the seasonality of our growing retail business.  We did proceed with most of the investments we had planned.  ", "Fortunately higher than expected revenues and strong gross margins translated to additional profits that largely offset the spending.  As we indicated last quarter outdoor margins should increase for the full year 2008 driven by solid improvement in the second half with particularly strong comparisons in the fourth quarter which is the seasonally most important quarter for our retail business. ", "While we are on the subject of margins I\u2019ll make a comment about margins in our other coalitions.  Jeans wear margins were down 340 basis points in the quarter.  As explained in the release, 110 basis points of the decline can be attributed to the absence of the gain that we had in last year\u2019s second quarter related to the sale of a business.  Another 50 basis points of the decline relates to the cost saving actions we referred to in the release which primarily resulted from the closure of a higher cost manufacturing plant.  ", "These actions, the cost of which in the quarter was $3 million will benefit future profitability by nearly $6 million per year.  In addition the jeans wear margins were impacted by a disproportionate effect of foreign currency translation in revenues versus profits considering the seasonally lower second quarter for international jeans operations. ", "As indicated in the release we do expect strong and stable jeans wear margins in the mid teens for the full year.  I should note the jeans wear margin comparisons will be particularly strong in the fourth quarter as you recall that last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating income reflected unusual operating expenses amounting to $8 million which we do not expect to repeat in this year\u2019s fourth quarter. ", "Now in terms of sportswear margins, as anticipated they were down in the quarter.  Most of the decline was related to the Nautica volume decline which came from two sources; the loss of a men\u2019s sportswear customer last year and the exit of our women\u2019s wholesale business.  Otherwise Nautica revenues would have been about flat with the prior year\u2019s quarter. ", "We indicated in the release that sportswear margins should improve to double-digit margins in the quarter.  Coalition\u2019s margins should be just below 10% in the third quarter and we expect margins recovering in the low to mid teen levels in the fourth quarter.  Now you will recall that in last year\u2019s fourth quarter sportswear margins were depressed primarily due to very high levels of promotional activity in our Nautica outlet stores.  We are very confident the issues we had last year have been corrected. ", "In addition, last year\u2019s margins were impacted by the losses from our women\u2019s sportswear business which won\u2019t be a factor in this year\u2019s fourth quarter considering our exit from the women\u2019s wholesale business earlier this year.  As a point of reference our core Nautica men\u2019s wholesale sportswear business has consistently been generating margins in the mid teens and we look forward to finally getting back to more normal operating margins for our sportswear coalition. ", "The contemporary brands margins were quite strong at 16%.  In fact margins were better than we had anticipated another reason for the stronger than expected second quarter earnings.  Image wear too had margins that were a bit stronger than we had anticipated due to higher volume and cost control initiatives. ", "Just to summarize second quarter operating margins they declined in the quarter from prior year levels due primarily to changes in our business.  Specifically the seasonality impact of our growing retail business, lower sportswear profitability and the aforementioned items impacting the comparisons within jeans wear but were much better than anticipated due to stronger performance in outdoor, contemporary brands and image wear as well as tight management of costs throughout our businesses. ", "Looking at the full year we continue to target an increase of operating margins of approximately 30 basis points.  We expect relatively stable margins in the third quarter and then a substantial improvement in operating margins in the fourth quarter.  I\u2019ve touched on some of the items which will benefit fourth quarter margins but just to summarize, first, fourth quarter is seasonally the most important period for our fast growing retail business which enjoys operating margins that are well above our corporate average in the fourth quarter.  ", "Our retail business will represent a bigger percent of our total business compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Second, we are looking for substantial improvement in sportswear margins.  Third, you\u2019ll recall that last year\u2019s fourth quarter jeans wear operating income and margins reflected unusual expenses that totaled $8 million so our jeans wear margins will have much more favorable comparisons this year. ", "Turning to our tax rate in the quarter at 28.5% it was well below that of the first quarter reflecting the favorable tax resolutions noted in the release.  This related to the outcome of audits every several tax years particularly in international jurisdictions. ", "Which brings us to the bottom line.  We originally anticipated the decline in our second quarter earnings per share so we are very pleased that we in fact beat last year\u2019s number by $0.01.  To be sure the tax resolutions helped us by $0.07 per share but the quarter also included $0.04 worth of expense reduction activities.  ", "Earlier in the year we indicated our intent to repurchase 2 million shares in 2008 which we completed in the second quarter.  We have 3.2 million shares remaining in our current authorization.  In terms of our balance sheet to reiterate what we said in the release inventories rose by 10% in the quarter but more than half of the increase was due to the company\u2019s acquired in the second half of 2007 where days are considerably higher than VF averages.", "Our inventories are in very good shape throughout all of our coalitions as this has been and will continue to be an area of intense focus for us.  As Eric indicated earlier, we feel very good about the balance of the year.  Despite the headwinds our brands are performing and our top line is solid.  We have confidence in the growth we expect in our retail and international businesses and in our ability to manage costs and inventories to maintain our strong profitability, drive high cash generation and fuel future earnings growth. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Before we turn the call over to Q&A I\u2019d like to give Mackey the opportunity to say a few words in closing.  Mackey is retiring effective August 1 after 25 years with the VF Corporation including the last 12 as CEO and the last 10 as Chairman of our Board of Directors.  He is a tough act to follow for sure.  Because of his leadership we are in a very strong position to both competitively and financially succeed in the years to come.  ", "Mackey McDonald", "", "I would like to add my congratulations to our VF associates for an outstanding performance in such a challenging environment.  My thanks to Eric and the VF management team for building a diversified business model and brand portfolio that continues to grow consumer demand and margins even with these headwinds. ", "Also my thanks to the many friends we have in the financial community whose analysis and challenges for these many years have inspired us to constantly work to transform our business model and we are proud of the results.  I will miss the exchange of ideas but the process will continue and the confidence in the VF business model will continue to grow. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "At this time we will open it up to your questions.  If any of you have lots of questions for Mackey I know he\u2019d love to take them.  ", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers. ", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Eric, when you look at the rest of the year and the assumptions and you really did a good job laying out your comfort level in terms of your assumptions for the second half of the year, can you elaborate a little bit more on your assumptions around the retail business in terms of comp trends in the different formats and your assumptions especially in the fourth quarter and your comfort level around the comp trends by each format of your retail establishments? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "It is a very complicated question because of the number of retail formats we have at VF Corporation and the number of countries we have stores in worldwide.  So when you look at any of our\u2026.just looking at one brand you could be looking at a brand that has stores in 20 countries so that makes it very difficult to answer that question. ", "I will tell you that in general our comp store growth assumptions in the back half of the year aren\u2019t as high as the comp store growth we achieved in the first half of the year.  So we are a little bit more conservative than our run rate in terms of growth assumptions.  We are still planning comp store growth but not at as high a rate as we did achieve in the first part of the year.  The dollar growth will be bigger of course because of the importance of the fourth quarter to all of our retail stores.  ", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "The other question I have is just on the sportswear business.  Especially your assumptions in the fourth quarter.  Around the Nautica business when you think about the trends we have seen in the department store business similar question just in terms of how you are comfortable with your assumptions in the sportswear business as you look at the department store channel or the primary channel for the Nautica business as you go into your assumptions in terms of that segment? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "The Nautica business as we all know has been challenged with both internal execution issues as well as environmental issues or external issues.  The biggest issue that affects its profit contribution is in the fourth quarter of last year the Nautica business had a really tough fourth quarter.  A lot of that was driven around mark down money both in our own retail stores and through our wholesale customers.  ", "We think we have got our arms around that and know we have a chance to do dramatically better from an earnings standpoint from Nautica in the fourth quarter and we are pretty confident based on the trends we have.  We are not expecting a big turnaround this year in the revenue part of the business.  We are expecting improvement in profitability in the back half of the year. ", "Was your question profit related Bob? ", "Robert Drbul \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Yes. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group. ", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "Eric are the pockets of weakness that you mentioned in the international markets primarily related to Europe or do they involve other markets as well? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Primarily Europe.  I commented on the last quarterly call that unlike what we experienced in 2007 we were beginning to see some weakness in the UK and Italy and Spain.  That hasn\u2019t improved at all.  We don\u2019t expect it to improve with the forecast we have been given but it is really a Western European softness that we talked about in the first quarter call and we acknowledge again today. ", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "Are sales in the Eastern European market as well as emerging markets, not only Russia but China and perhaps even India starting to show some traction in terms of sales momentum? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "We have had great momentum over the last year or so in the markets you mentioned.  China, Russia, India and certain parts of Mexico and Latin America.  We have got traction in those markets and are getting strong growth in those markets. ", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "Are the operating margins in those markets as strong as they are in both the U.S. and Western Europe? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "No they are not.  We are investing for growth there and we are getting the growth but we are making the investments to build our brands at this time. ", "John Shanley \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "Can you give us an idea of what the currency benefit in the quarter was in terms of foreign sales? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "On the bottom line it was, the EPS line it was just a couple of pennies and the top line it was 3 percentage points. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "", "I was hoping to get a little more color on the operating margins for the quarter.  Outdoor obviously came in a little bit better than expected.  I think you said on your last call the plan there was for about 50-100 basis point improvement over last year.  I\u2019m guessing you are more positive on that now given where Q2 came in? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "You are talking about for the full year? ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "For the full year, yes. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "We continue to expect that improvement.  Remember that the second quarter is a smaller quarter so it doesn\u2019t have quite the impact you might imagine so we still expect to see the same level of improvement that we talked about in the quarter. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "On jeans wear margin down there about half of that was for the reasons you mentioned.  What was the other half?  Was it just a function of volume?  Can you maybe speak to the volume being down there?  Is this for the same reasons you saw in the first quarter? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "It was.  After you sort through the unusuals it was down about a point.  Taking into consideration the unusual items.  There is one other thing that does stand out.  That is we did recognize a $4 million provision in our U.S. businesses associated with some troubled retailers. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "Are you still seeing trading down at Wal-Mart?  You spoke to that in the last call. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Yes I spoke to that in the last call and I think in general in every channel of distribution customers are experiencing some trade down.  That helps us in some places because if there are people who didn\u2019t used to shop at Wal-Mart that are shopping there we have great brands for them there.  But the people within Wal-Mart who are trading down to the lowest price point that is not where we are. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "Lastly on the margins.  Obviously your international retail businesses performed very well for the quarter.  Can you just speak to the profitability of those businesses and how that profitability compares to a year ago? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Just on the international retailers? ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "Both international and retail, not international retail. ", "Robert Shearer", "", "In any given quarter profitability is obviously impacted by the number of new stores opening.  So on the quarter retail businesses overall in the second quarter actually reduced the overall profitability, reduced our overall margins and again it has a lot to do with the number of store openings that took place in the quarter.  Again, the exact thing that we see and of course the businesses grow.  So in the second quarter as we talked about the seasonality of those businesses has impacted any given quarter with the second quarter being the lowest quarter of revenues had that impact.  ", "So it grows and we would expect to see more of that kind of thing as we go forward.  Now in the fourth quarter however that situation reverses itself with the fourth quarter being a very strong quarter and profitability of our retail businesses being quite strong in the fourth quarter with the improvement in retail driving up the fourth quarter margins. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "How about the international side? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Relative to retail? ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "No.  Just relative to a year ago in terms of the profitability of that business. ", "Robert Shearer", "", "The thing, once again, keep in mind on the international side that particularly in jeans once again it is the seasonality issue.  The second quarter for our international jeans business is the lowest quarter for that business.  So what happens is the currency impact drives the revenues up somewhat but there is just not a lot of profits so it doesn\u2019t have the same impact on the overall profitability.  So, the profitability overall was pretty much comparable to last year but again because of seasonality it is low in the second quarter. ", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert Baird", "", "On the tax rate obviously you saw a benefit in the quarter.  Are you still looking at for the balance of the year 33.3% in terms of the tax rate? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Right about 33% for the last two quarters. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse First Boston. ", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse First Boston", "I thought I\u2019d take this opportunity Eric given that it is Mackey\u2019s last call to have you perhaps prioritize your view on the opportunities and the opportunities of the highest importance or the highest return on opportunities whether it is retail, emerging markets, acquisitions if you look to take this company to the next level if you will in the coming years.  How do you think about the growth opportunities for this company and where do you think are the best, easiest high return opportunities are that you are going to pursue most aggressively as the CEO? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "I\u2019ll try to do in 60 seconds what we laid out in early January in four hours about what our growth plans are for the next five years because that is what our agenda is today.  This corporation hasn\u2019t really changed and certainly hasn\u2019t changed since January.  ", "We see terrific opportunities in lifestyle brands.  We are winning where we have strong lifestyle brands.  We\u2019ll continue to invest in those brands and continue to get growth particularly right now in the outdoor space.  We talked about terrific outdoor growth contributing in our path from $7 billion to $11 billion.  ", "We have also talked about increasing our international business from 28% of $7 billion to 33% of $11 billion over the next five years and increasing our owned retail business from 14% of our business to 22% of our business.  So international growth in total and owned retail are big, big drivers of growth. ", "At the same time we have really large businesses and big U.S. customers.  In our growth plan we have those business relationships baked in $600 million worth of growth.  We will continue to make acquisitions along the same path we have talked about.  Our priorities right now are in outdoor and in our contemporary brand space.  We have made a commitment to get into the contemporary business.  When we talked about it in January we had just Seven for All Mankind and Lucy and now we have added the 1/3 ownership of Mo Industries to that opportunity and are still looking at that space.  ", "I tried to be quick.  It is a long subject but those are our priorities. ", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse First Boston", "If you think about a fixed resource environment at least hypothetically do you see emerging markets international as a greater priority than retail or acquisitions or do you see all three being equally important? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "I think part of our success is we are able to invest in and get growth from many different agendas.  I think for us to be sitting here five years from now as successful as we are today we\u2019re going to invest in all of those in a balanced way that we laid out in that plan because we want to be strong in all those areas.  We think that is what will keep us strong five years from now. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets. ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "I was wondering if you could give a little color on how the bookings are shaping up across the coalitions, not specific numbers but maybe just a little bit more color.  ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "We\u2019re having trouble hearing you.  Could you speak up? ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Is this any better?  So, I have three questions.  The first one if you could give us just a little bit of color on how the bookings are shaping up across all the coalitions.  Secondly, if you can give us any sense of why the reason behind the reduction in new store growth.  I think there was maybe a fall out in some stores there.  ", "Lastly just in terms of the mid teen margin expectations in the back half it sounds like if I understand you correctly you are expecting some positive comp in the retail doors but at a lower level than you experienced in the first half.  That seems a little more conservative.  What do you assume will occur in the department mass channel wholesale side of the business?  What trends are you expecting there in order to hit your projections? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Let me deal with the bookings piece because some of our businesses have bookings and some don\u2019t.  Probably the best way to answer that is our revenue guidance for the year got moved up a tick to $7.9 billion.  In this environment and I\u2019m sure you will appreciate this Todd but in this environment we have good indication of bookings or we would not be that aggressive with our revenue outlook as tough as it is out there.  So where we have bookings they are strong and strong enough to support increasing our revenue guidance just a little bit.  ", "In terms of reduction in new store expectations I think our guidance at the beginning of the year was 75-100.  So the guidance we have put in this draft is over 90.  So while we haven\u2019t really reduced that there is some execution lease\u2026.we haven\u2019t changed our strategy as much as the opportunities are actually falling into the high end of the range of what we thought was possible. ", "The last question on margins I\u2019m going to turn over to Bob.  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t hear.  What was the question? ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "The last question had to do with mid teen operating margins in the second half of the year, is that right Todd? ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Yes, and I was curious about what your expectations were on the wholesale side of the business and the department store, mass merchant area.  What trends are you expecting? You said you expected a little bit of a deceleration in the comp store sales trend in your own stores so I was curious what you were expecting on the department, mass channel? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Specifically in the mass channel, Todd, our margins should hold with where they have been historically.  So we are not anticipating any significant decline relative to\u2026you talk about margins I assume you are talking about the operating margin level? ", "Todd Slater \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "I\u2019m just talking about business activity.  Do you expect those partners to continue to lets say, outside of the discount, the mass, the mid tier, the Penney\u2019s, the Kohl\u2019s to Macy\u2019s to the better stores do you expect those comps to still be negative if they continue to have down comps are you still comfortable with your assumptions? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "We are comfortable with our assumptions and we think we factored in conditions at retail in terms of the numbers we put out there in our margins.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch.  ", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "First, can you give us a sense on your retail stores how the outlet comps were versus the full line store comps and if there was any change in the relative performance between those two?  Secondly, I just wanted to clarify for the fourth quarter on your own retail is it still primarily North Face and Vans as the key driver or is there something else you are expecting to kick in this fourth quarter as well?  Finally, I might have missed it but if you haven\u2019t given an update on sourcing costs I\u2019d love to hear it.  ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "I\u2019ll take a shot at the first two of those and let Bob swing into gear on the sourcing costs.  I do not have, Robbie, specifics for all the outlet stores we have worldwide versus full price stores we have worldwide and what the comps are for those.  I will tell you as a general rule and this is going to be a statement of the obvious but our strongest brands that have retail formats, those stores have really strong comps.  Stores like our John Varvatos stores, our Napapijri stores, our North Face stores and our Vans stores are having very, very strong comps in this environment. ", "Our pure outlet stores aren\u2019t faring as well.  So in the range of performance at the high end you have our strongest, best performing brands overall and at the low end you have some of our outlet operations.  I hope that is helpful to some degree because that is as good as I can do with what I have.  ", "I\u2019m not sure I understood your fourth quarter retail question. ", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "My question was you hold out the North Face and Vans in particular, I believe, this quarter in the outdoor coalition so as I\u2019m looking at retail and the strength you are expecting for the fourth quarter this year by brand is it North Face and Vans primarily that is the driver to the growth or are there some other brands that I should be thinking about on the retail side that helped with that profit mix shift you are expecting?", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Fore sure our owned, full price retail execution at The North Face and Vans are performing very strongly for those brands and are a big contributor to the growth numbers we gave you for both The North Face and Vans.  In fact in the North American part of the Vans business the retail business, the owned retail business is over 50% of the business.  They are very successful and they are performing well. ", "Then I\u2019d have to go back to my earlier comment that all of our strong brands have a good holiday business and we expect that to continue.  ", "Robert Shearer", "", "You were talking about profitability, right, in terms of margins in particular as well?  ", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "I understand the retail mix shift.  I\u2019m just trying to conceptualize how much is this really you are expecting very strong comps at North Face and Vans in particular to drive that retail mix shift in the U.S. to support the fourth quarter earnings growth. ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Of course Nautica is a piece of that as well particularly from the profitability side.  As we have talked about we had a particularly tough quarter last year in the fourth quarter.  We do expect to see some significant improvement there. ", "Robert Ohmes \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Just on the sourcing costs? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "We have been working hard at getting in front of cost increases that have been anticipated by us and others. Net of cost reductions that we see and again are working very diligently against we think that our overall product costs right now look like they would increase in the low single-digit area. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jared Orr \u2013 Morgan, Keegan. ", "Jared Orr \u2013 Morgan, Keegan", "", "I see your corporate expenses came down $10 million year-over-year from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2008.  I was just wondering how that was accomplished and what the outlook for the remainder of the year was for the corporate expenses? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Corporate expenses have been running down.  We indicated and again it is a little bit of a catch all so we just have to be a little bit careful with that because some miscellaneous items flow through there.  We have been cautious about our spending.  In this environment we felt it was the prudent thing to do and for VF Corporation we\u2019d like to see those dollars against promotional activity within our businesses. ", "Jared Orr \u2013 Morgan, Keegan", "", "You got a $0.02 dilution for contemporary brands in Q2.  Our math it looks like it is a [inaudible].  Are we doing this correctly or is there any accretion better than the guidance? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "The accretion related to the acquisitions was better than we anticipated by a few pennies.  The Seven for All Mankind Business, the contemporary brands coalition really had a strong quarter particularly from a profitability side so it was about $0.02 or $0.03 stronger than we had anticipated. ", "Jared Orr \u2013 Morgan, Keegan", "What level of accretion do you have embedded for the whole year? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "That number was around $0.10 I believe and we are still on track or maybe even a little bit better.  Our plan is, again we are running a little bit stronger than our plans had indicated. ", "Jared Orr \u2013 Morgan, Keegan", "Your OpEx do you know what assumption or Euro rate you are using for the third quarter and fourth quarter? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "Four the third quarter we use 155, again just a little bit below where it is today and for the fourth quarter 150.  That is what is built into our expectations. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Christian [Blue] \u2013 Thomas Weisel. ", "Christian [Blue] \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "", "I just wanted to ask about some of the SG&A and investment in the outdoor coalition.  Did some of that get shifted into 3Q? ", "Robert Shearer", "", "No there really wasn\u2019t any shift.  There were a couple things that took place there.  One the volume was higher so some of that spending we felt would stand out more in the second quarter didn\u2019t so much because of the increase in volume.  That is a way to absorb expenses.  ", "Another factor was that we pointed out when we laid out the second quarter and provided the guidance we also talked about an area like distribution.  Once again with just taking an awfully close look at our costs we were able to actually reduce our distribution spend by being more efficient on the distribution side.  So again really addressing those areas we felt represented a higher expense to us and really getting on them and we had better performance overall so we were really pleased with that.  ", "So no it is not a shift into the third quarter.  It is just better absorption and a little bit lower spending overall than anticipated. ", "Christian [Blue] \u2013 Thomas Weisel", "[Audio breaks up]", "Robert Shearer", "", "Areas that will drive future growth and will drive revenue growth in areas and other areas. ", "Operator", "", "We have no further questions in the queue at this time. ", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Thank you.  I appreciate you all joining us.  We are quite proud of what we accomplished in the second quarter.  It has been a long time since we had to work in this difficult of an environment and I am very, very pleased that we have the business model we have and proud of the management team and associates at VF that are so focused on executing and making this environment be as good as it can be for our shareholders.

Baird & Company", "Operator", "Welcome to the VF Corporation third quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jean Fontana.", "Jean Fontana", "By now you should have received today\u2019s earnings press release.  If not, please call 203-682-8200 and we will get you a copy immediately following the call.  Hosting the call this morning is Eric Wiseman, President and CEO of VF.", "Before we begin we would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today\u2019s remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results of operations or financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "As you saw in this morning\u2019s release we announced record third quarter results and we indicated that we expect record results in the fourth quarter as well.  I\u2019m extremely proud of the achievements of our brands and the VF team in what is certainly a challenging environment.  We\u2019re expecting 2008 to be the record year in our 109 year history, which speaks volumes I think about the strength of our business model and our people.", "We\u2019ve consistently said that we\u2019re not immune to market challenges but we do believe we\u2019re positioned better than most to withstand them successfully.  First, because of our diversity in brands, product categories, geographies and channels of distribution.  Second, because we\u2019ve built a portfolio of some of the most powerful brands in the industry which will continue to attract customers in both good times and bad.  Third, because we have a sound long-term plan for growth and a long track record of superior execution.  Fourth, because we have a team here at VF that\u2019s passionate about winning, experienced at facing and overcoming challenges, and committed to delivering superior results.", "Now with that as a backdrop, this morning we announced record third quarter revenues and earnings.  Earnings per share rose 13% in the third quarter.  We exceeded our earnings per share guidance which called for an increase of 9% with the help of additional tax credits, but we were right in line excluding the unusual items.  Revenues were up 6.4% which was below our original target of 9% but that is probably not surprising given the slowdown at retail that began to accelerate in September.", "We also announced that we continue to expect record revenues and earnings in the fourth quarter.  Since market conditions have become much more difficult than we could have possibly foreseen, we are tempering our outlook and lowering our fourth quarter guidance for both revenues and earnings.", "I should also point out that we did announce an increase in our quarterly dividend rate from $0.58 to $0.59 per share.  2008 will mark our 36th consecutive year of higher dividend payments to our shareholders.", "More specifically regarding the change in our fourth quarter guidance, recent global financial challenges have led us to reduce our expectations for the upcoming holiday season.  Our previous guidance for an 8% revenue increase and a 20% earnings per share increase.  We now expect a 3% to 4% increase in revenues and a 1% to 5% increase in earnings per share.  We\u2019re planning for higher revenues in our outdoor and contemporary brand coalitions while we anticipate slightly lower revenues in our jeanswear and image wear coalitions.", "Operating margins should be flat to up slightly with continued expansion in gross margin as our retail revenue growth continues.  At the same time we\u2019re not going back on advertising and product development investments.  In fact we\u2019re planning higher spending in both areas in the quarter versus last year to keep our brands front and center with consumers.", "I want to stress that the change in our fourth quarter guidance is entirely related to recent external market conditions both here and abroad and not to brand specific issues.  As you know we\u2019ve met or exceeded our plan in each of the first three quarters; however we now believe that consumers will be much more selective in their spending and we believe VF is well positioned to get our fair share of that spending on apparel given our strong brands and our global reach.", "We remain confident in the health of our brands, their long-term prospects for growth and in our ability to achieve our long-term targets of $11 billion in revenue and a 15% operating margin by 2012.  ", "Now next you may be wondering, given these conditions how are we approaching our planning for next year?  In terms of how we\u2019re planning for next year, I\u2019d say realistically and cautiously.  I\u2019ll not make any specific comments about our revenue or earnings expectations for next year at this time but I can say that we anticipate the economic conditions will remain challenging throughout 2009 and that we are planning accordingly.", "We will aggressively manage our costs and continue our focus on inventory control, and as I mentioned previously we have a long track record of superior execution in both good times and bad and will deploy these skills in full to navigate our way through the challenges we face today.", "One question also related to next year that we hear a lot is about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of cost inflation and to what degree we can raise our prices next year.  We\u2019ve said that at this point we expect a net increase in cost of about 3% through the first half of next year.  We believe our size and diverse sourcing platform provide us with a competitive advantage in this environment and we\u2019ll continue to work aggressively to manage the impact of cost inflation throughout the year.  At this point we believe we can offset most if not all of this increase in cost through selective price increases particularly in those cases where we\u2019re bringing new product innovations to market.", "Another question you might have is how the credit crunch is affecting us and our ability to fund our operations.  Fortunately, and this will come as no surprise, our financial condition is very solid.  We have no liquidity issues and our cash flow is strong.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob Shearer who will provide additional details on the quarter.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I\u2019ll start with highlights of the quarter.  As Eric mentioned, third quarter revenues rose 6.4%.  This was driven by a continued momentum in our outdoor coalition and a strong contribution from our new contemporary brands coalition.  In this challenging environment jeanswear, image wear and sportswear each reported modest revenue declines in the quarter.", "You\u2019ll recall that we previously anticipated a 9% increase in third quarter revenues.  The shortfall was pretty much across the board reflecting weakening economic conditions as well as the impact of a strengthening dollar which accounted for about 1% of the roughly 2% point difference versus guidance.", "As you\u2019re no doubt aware, the market weakness has extended to Europe and other international markets and our business there was softer than previously anticipated.  However, international revenues still grew by a very healthy 22% in the quarter driven by also a 22% increase in our international outdoor business as well as continued growth in our jeanswear businesses in Asia and Latin America.", "In the quarter international revenues accounted for 34% of total revenues.  By year end we expect international revenues to account for 30% of total revenues.  So we are making very good progress toward our goal of achieving 1/3 of total revenues from international markets by 2012.", "Expansion in our direct to consumer business has also been fueling our growth this year.  As noted in the release our retail revenues were up 12% in the quarter and accounted for 14% of total revenues.  Again, we\u2019re certainly feeling the impact from the slowing economy in our retail businesses but we also noted that we achieved double-digit growth in retail revenues in our Vans, The North Face, Kipling, Napapijri, John Varvatos, lucy and Lee brands in the quarter.  For the full year retail revenues should account for 15% of our total revenues, so again we are making progress as we look for retail revenues to account for 22% of total revenues by 2012.", "We opened a total of 20 stores in the quarter.  The brands accounting for most of those new stores were Vans, The North Face, 7 For All Mankind and Napapijri.  In the fourth quarter we\u2019re on track to open an additional 30+ stores.  That will bring us to a total of approximately 90 new stores opened in 2008 and that\u2019s right in line with our target of opening 75 to 100 new stores this year.", "Our retail stores continued to perform very well for us.  We have a very disciplined process by which we approve new store openings, we track their financial performance very carefully, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in opening new stores across our strongest brand concepts.", "Turning next to gross margins.  As you saw in our release, gross margins continued to expand in the quarter rising by 50 basis points.  This improvement is driven by our growth in lifestyle businesses with our retail revenue growth being a primary contributor to the expanding gross margins within these brands.", "SG&A as a percent of revenues grew by 60 basis points in the quarter.  The cost reduction initiatives in charge related to unremitted taxes and duties referred to in the release accounted for 50 basis points of that increase or $12 million.  The cost reduction initiatives were concentrated primarily in our jeanswear and sportswear coalitions and totaled $5 million.  The annualized benefit from these actions in future periods will total $8 million.  And as to the charge for unremitted taxes and duties during the quarter, we recognized a duty and tax related issue, that\u2019s VAT, within our 7 For All Mankind business that arose prior to our acquisition of the brand.", "That gets us to the operating income line.  Our operating margins were about flat with prior year levels but the cost reduction and tax and duty charges of $12 million I just discussed impacted operating margins by 50 basis points.  So on an apples-to-apples basis operating margins would have been above prior year levels.", "Looking at operating margins by coalition, we saw the benefits of continued strong volume growth as well as expansion in our very profitable international businesses contribute to an 80 basis point improvement in outdoor operating margins.", "We also saw higher margins in our sportswear coalition.  You\u2019ll recall that we indicated that we expected to see sportswear margins return to double-digit levels by the fourth quarter.  We\u2019re pleased to see sportswear operating margins above 10% particularly since it includes expenses related to some organizational changes that were included in the cost reduction initiatives that I discussed earlier.  The total cost for those actions in the sportswear operating income number was $1.5 million.", "Jeanswear margins were down as the level of promotional activity, particularly in the US, picked up during the quarter.  In addition higher sales of lower margin new fashion product moved gross margins lower.  The jeanswear operating margin also included the impact of cost reduction initiatives that totaled $2.4 million in the quarter.", "The operating margin in our contemporary brands coalition reflects a charge of $6 million related to the tax and duty issue that I previously mentioned, and that impacted this coalition\u2019s operating margin by 630 basis points in the quarter.", "We were also pleased by the operating margin increase achieved by image wear in the quarter.", "Our income tax rate in the quarter was 28.3% compared with 33.7% last year as mentioned in the release.  We benefited from a significant tax credit in the quarter which accounted for the lower tax rate.", "And that brings us to the 13% increase in EPS in the quarter.  The $2.10 we reported includes the net benefit of $0.07 from the tax credits and unusual items.  The tax credits benefited EPS by $0.14 per share while the cost reduction initiatives and tax and duty provision cost us $0.07 in EPS in the quarter.  Also, versus our guidance EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 per share from the stronger dollar.", "Now a few words on our balance sheet and financial condition.  As Eric noted, our financial position remains strong.  In the release we noted that cash flow from operations is expected to be between $650 million and $700 million this year.  By year end we expect to pay down our outstanding commercial paper which is approximately $360 million, and we also expect cash on the balance sheet to be above the $226 million recorded as of the end of the third quarter.  We have $1.3 billion in lines of credit through a strong diversified base of domestic and international lenders and no long-term debt repayments due until October of 2010.", "Considering the environment our management of working capital is an area where we put intense pressure on our operating units and our results reflect our progress with days outstanding and our receivables actually down a bit and our increase in inventory in line with our Q4 top line growth expectations.", "As we look toward the end of the year with continued pressure on controlling our inventory levels both within VF and at retail, we believe that inventory comparisons will show further improvement.  We now expect the 2008 year-end inventory levels will be only a couple of percentage points above 2007.", "Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 28.8% at the end of September.  Net of cash this ratio would be 25.7% barring any acquisition activity between now and year end.  Our debt-to-cap ratio by year end should be in the low 20s and on a net of cash basis below the 20% level.", "To follow up on Eric\u2019s comments on the fourth quarter guidance, we\u2019re now expecting a 3% to 4% increase in revenues; that\u2019s all organic growth; versus our previous expectation of an 8% increase.  On the top line 2% points of the difference is related to the assumption of a stronger dollar versus our prior guidance when our assumption was that the Q4 Euro rate would approximately 150 versus today\u2019s assumption of 135.  The remainder of the top line difference is related to the tougher retail conditions existing today and particularly based on what we\u2019ve seen in the past two to four weeks.", "In the fourth quarter we expect improvements in operating margins in our outdoor, contemporary and sportswear coalitions.  We expect continuation of the expansion in gross margins in the quarter as retail grows and accounts for a larger portion of fourth quarter revenue gains.", "And as Eric mentioned, we are continuing to invest in areas that will kept our brands healthy and growing.  In fact our advertising spend is expected to be 15% to 20% higher than in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  You\u2019ll recall that the 2007 fourth quarter included restructuring costs that approximated $14 million representing a 70 basis point impact in that quarter.", "In terms of just a few other data points, the tax rate in the fourth quarter should approximate 32% again reflecting a couple of cents worth of anticipated credits; capital spending should approximate $120 million in 2008; depreciation and amortization should be about $160 million.", "And now, back to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "In closing let me say that our track record of strength, stability and excellence in execution makes me confident that we\u2019ll emerge from this current economic cycle stronger than ever.  While times like these necessitate that we intensify our focus on both costs and inventories, we\u2019re fortunate that we have the financial resources that will also enable us to continue to make smart investments in our brands to keep them strong and healthy.  I\u2019m very encouraged by the fact that in this environment we expect to deliver 7% to 8% revenue growth and 8% to 9% earnings growth for our shareholders in 2008 and to have our sixth consecutive record year.", "With that we\u2019ll open the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Bob, what was the impact on foreign exchange in the quarter, and how are you thinking about that into the fourth quarter and as you look into next year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Starting with the third quarter, as we said a little bit different rate particularly on the Euro than we anticipated but still helped revenues by a couple percentage points and added $0.05 or $0.06 a share.  Now again, what I referred to in my comments earlier was versus our guidance again so a little bit less than that.", "In the fourth quarter, once again assuming the 135 Euro versus our prior guidance so obviously having some impact there versus the prior guidance.  So actually of course the Euro being below last year\u2019s fourth quarter actually pulls our revenues down by about a percentage point, and in the fourth quarter it will cost us about $0.03 a share.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Eric, a couple questions for you.  Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing by brand in terms of orders as you get into the spring period, and specifically if you could share a number on the Northeast spring backlog, that would great?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I don\u2019t have specific numbers for every brand at VF in front of me but I will tell you that there\u2019s caution out there and we\u2019re seeing that caution reflected in our order base going forward.  Our stronger lifestyle brands continue to do better than our other brands in terms of spring bookings but our long-term guidance for brands like The North Face, we\u2019re not seeing any signs that\u2019s going to slow down based on what we now know.  Probably not as specific as you\u2019d like but that\u2019s my answer.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital", "On inventories, are there any inventory areas that you\u2019re concerned about either of your brands on the wholesale level or at the retail level, and specifically on contemporary?  There have been some 7 products in the clubs in the off price.  I was just wondering if you could just maybe talk about where the inventories are and the run rate of that business specifically?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Let me comment on the 7 For All Mankind inventory that\u2019s in the clubs.  We are aware of that.  We were not made aware of that by anything we did internally.  We don\u2019t know specifically how we got there but it\u2019s not our policy to do that and if we find out how it got there, if it came from one of our customers, they will no longer be a customer of that brand.", "Bob can comment on the channel inventories.", "Robert K. Shearer", "On overall inventories, again as I mentioned in the comments, a lot of pressure.  We put a lot of pressure obviously on operating units knowing the impacts that excess inventories can cause.  So no, there really aren\u2019t any pockets.  If we saw inventories getting a little bit higher than they should have been, again we took a lot of actions to work those down.  As I said, by the end of the year we expect to see even better comps in our inventories.  It\u2019s just an area that we\u2019re going to continue to put more and more pressure on.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in Europe and how that has transpired for you maybe by brand or by region?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "We\u2019ve started talking about slowdowns in select European markets I think on the first quarter call.  I think what we\u2019ve seen is a widening of that trend, more across Western Europe.  I would say that in total Western Europe kind of looks like the US right now in terms of slowdown in our business.  Interestingly our brands are still doing well.  We had strong growth from our international outdoor business in particular and strong double-digit growth in the outdoor business in Western Europe.  And obviously markets for us like China and Mexico and Latin America are doing very well for us right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "On the outdoor side, one of the lowest growth rates you\u2019ve put up in that business in some time but it sounds like you\u2019re expecting it to bounce back a little bit in the fourth quarter.  Can you share with us why you\u2019re comfortable that the revenue rate will bounce back in the fourth quarter in that business?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Part of the answer there of course is the retail side.  Our retail business in the fourth quarter is by far the largest quarter and even though we\u2019re planning that a little more conservatively it\u2019s a factor obviously.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "So there\u2019s not some assumption that the wholesale business is going to snap back on a year-over-year basis?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Retail is a significant factor in that improvement.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "I also want to ask Eric about two of the decisions you mentioned in the release.  I know the dividend increase is very small but is there anything we should read behind that?  And also so many companies are kind of in capital protection mode right now given just the massive uncertainty out there.  The decision to increase marketing spend, how are you thinking about capital allocation and what you\u2019re going to do with your cash through this environment especially in the context of your previously stated strategy to pursue acquisitions where they make sense?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "On the dividend question, we have made a $0.01 per share increase in our dividend payment.  It\u2019s as I said our 36th consecutive year of increasing our dividends to our shareholders and we are confident in our position and in our future and wanted to share that with our shareholders.", "On the increase in advertising spending, we have been adamant all year that we have a long-term plan to build our brands around the world and that implies with it investment in brand development and investment in product development.  We have encouraged if not insisted that each of our coalitions not back off on those investments where they\u2019re making progress.  I think that\u2019s smart for us long term.  I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.", "I think in this environment if you have good marketing and advertising, it\u2019s a great time to show it.  If you believe consumers are going to be much more selective in the choices they make when they\u2019re spending, I\u2019d rather have the best products supported by great brands that they\u2019re seeing in the media on a regular basis with compelling advertising.  I just think that\u2019s the right thing to do and we can afford to do that and will continue it.", "Bob, did you want to deal with any part of that now?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I think that covers it.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "As you invest behind these brands, it sounds like a lot of it\u2019s on the international side but it sounds like you\u2019re also continuing to invest in your domestic businesses behind the key brands you want to grow.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure.  A good example is in our mass jeans business and you\u2019ve seen the television commercials that we run for the Wrangler brand, and we think that\u2019s helping that brand do well in the mass channel.  It\u2019s been flat for the last two quarters but if you look at everything going on in the world, we\u2019re happy with flat in the last two quarters.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "So how do you see this playing out?  If some of your competition out there is retrenching, pulling back on spending and just trying to preserve capital and protect their balance sheet while you guys kind of have the balance sheet to probably be a little more proactive in this environment, as retailer bankruptcies emerge do you see risk out there in the market place in terms of a lot of dislocation where you guys can come in and take market share?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "That would be our wish and it\u2019s why we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brands.  It\u2019s times like these that strong companies I think have a great opportunity to invest in their brands and if they invest wisely, I think that they\u2019ll gain market share.  We\u2019re hoping that we invest wisely.  We\u2019re confident that we have the right brands and the right products out there right now that with these investments I hope we will gain share and outperform the market.  I\u2019ll remind you that we\u2019re going to have a 7% to 8% top line growth this year in what has been the most difficult year any of us have had to deal with in a long, long time.", "And on the acquisition front, I think there may be some opportunities that come up from good brands that are struggling to make it through this liquidity crisis right now.  We may have some opportunity there as well.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse First Boston", "I was surprised that you said in your cost inflation expectations for next year you\u2019re still holding at 3%.  You\u2019re not seeing inflation moderate in your business?  You\u2019re not expecting it to moderate the way the rest of the world is seeing inflation come back into normal levels?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I probably could have been a little bit more specific in that comment.  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do that.  My comment was that similar to the comment we made a couple weeks ago out in San Leandro at The North Face and Vans meeting.  We have real good visibility the first half of the year because we\u2019ve contracted for most of that production and for most of those raw materials, and that\u2019s the time we\u2019re seeing a net of 3%.  ", "You\u2019re right.  A lot of the commodity prices have come down recently and the whole question about what the cost of labor will be for the back half of next year is still unknown.  My comment was really more geared towards the first half and we\u2019re working hard to make the second half even better.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane - Citigroup.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "I just have a quick question on your jeanswear business.  Did you still see down-trading away from your brands in the jeanswear business domestically?  And if so, have you adjusted your prices in order to better compete in this segment?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I\u2019ve said this all year.  There has been a consumer trend towards thrift this year in the US market for sure.  We\u2019ve benefited some from that because as more customers have gone to thrift we have the largest branded presence in the mass channels.  So we\u2019ve picked up some of that business.  There have also been programs that are less expensive than ours that have been successful in the channel as well but we think we\u2019ve been really a beneficiary of that.  Yes, there has been an increase requirement of promotional investment this year to stimulate consumer demand.  We\u2019re seeing that for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Shanley - Susquehanna Investment Group.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna Investment Group", "Bob, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the performance of the retail stores.  Were the comps pretty much at your expectations or were some of the divisions a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker than you would have thought they would have been in the third quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Actually the comps were pretty much on expectation as again I said in my comments off a bit but still our full price stores posted upper single-digit kinds of comps.  That\u2019s across the board.  Obviously some higher than that.  I will also tell you that for the fourth quarter we\u2019ve planned that down a bit by a few percentage points but yes, overall the strong brands just continue to perform whether that\u2019s at wholesale or at retail.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna Investment Group", "Was the outlet store business also as strong as the in line stores?", "Robert K. Shearer", "No.  The outlet stores weren\u2019t.  That would be the area that was a little bit different.  Actually tougher comparisons there and I think that\u2019s where the effects of the economy seemed to hit us a little bit harder from that standpoint.  But not as much on the full price stores.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna Investment Group", "Turning to Europe for a minute, can you give us a little bit more color in terms of how the various brands performed in key markets?  Were there any markets that were particularly strong?  I recall in the first and second quarter you had commented specifically about Russia being a major growth opportunity.  Is Russia still viewed as something that\u2019s going to be a growing component of the European business or has that slowed down?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I\u2019ll try to deal with that question though it\u2019ll be difficult on a by brand basis.  I think at the first quarter review we talked about Italy, Spain and the UK beginning to show signs of weakness.  The situation there has not improved.  In fact it may have deteriorated in terms of the macro-economic situation in each of those countries.  I think that other Western European countries are getting involved in this malaise right now.  Certainly Germany and France are showing some signs of slowing down on a macro-economic level.", "Most of our brands in Europe had double-digit growth in the third quarter so we have outperformed those markets at this moment in time.", "Your question about Russia, we think Russia long term is going to be terrific for us.  We are continuing to invest in there.  We are investing behind our jeans and outdoor brands there.  We think it\u2019s the right long-term thing to do.  In the last 60 days, has there been economic interruption in that market?  Yes there has, just as there has been in the United States market.  It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not focused on our long-term potential there.  In fact this might be a great time for us to pick up some share there.", "John Shanley - Susquehanna Investment Group", "A question about the advertising spend going up 15% to 20%.  Is that across the board or are there some components of the company that are going to get a richer advertising expenditure capability and some that are going to be cut back?", "Robert K. Shearer", "It is pretty much across the board.  As Eric mentioned I believe, jeanswear is clearly a part of that.  Obviously we focus our advertising spend on a brand-by-brand basis and also a specific new product launch as well.  We\u2019re driving those dollars toward those areas that are clearly the strongest areas such as in the jeanswear business what\u2019s working really right now is differentiation and newness in product.  So that\u2019s where the dollars are going.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan.", "Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan", "You talked about the top line weakness of the past few weeks.  I\u2019m looking at your fourth quarter guidance.  Can you talk about what you assume in terms of the promotional environment for the fourth quarter, especially looking at brands like North Face that have pretty high price point items in terms of winter jackets for the fourth quarter?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "In general we\u2019re dealing with a moment in history that has lots of moving parts and we all know that.  There\u2019s a lot moving around and very recent moving parts.  In general our assumptions for the fourth quarter are that this environment of the last four weeks carries forward.", "In general that means that we\u2019re going to have to make some more investments in moving our goods.  We are confident that we can deliver the guidance that we put out there and that it does assume that there will be some promotional investments that are just going to be necessary in this environment to get things across our brands.  I don\u2019t unfortunately have specific guidance for each of our brands but in general that\u2019s true.  I think that\u2019s a prudent approach for us to take for the fourth quarter.", "Bob, is there anything else?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I guess I\u2019d just say a little bit more promotion in perhaps the jeanswear area than outdoor.  You mentioned specifically TNF.  We\u2019d expect a little bit more dollars to be spent in the jeanswear area than some of our other brands.", "Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan", "As a follow up to that, you talked about your expectations for margin improvement for the outdoor and contemporary coalitions for the fourth quarter.  Can you talk just roughly about how much of that margin increase is due to the seasonality of having more retail versus just business year-on-year?  If you can just give us that half of it is or some rough number just to quantify it a little?", "Robert K. Shearer", "In the gross margin in the fourth quarter?  Is that what you\u2019re referring to?", "Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan", "Right.  Gross or operating margin.  How much of it is just due to having more retail as a percent of the mix?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Most of it actually.  Most of the margin expansion that we\u2019re seeing does in fact come from the stronger gross margins and overall profitability of our retail business in the fourth quarter.  Now that\u2019s more so in the outdoor side.  Our retail business in contemporary is still not a big piece of the total so that\u2019s a comment that\u2019s driven more in outdoor.", "Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan", "In terms of spending, can you kind of talk through your thoughts about spending the money on advertising versus maybe on share buy-backs?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "The amount of money that we\u2019re spending on advertising we think can have a material effect on our brands in key markets.  I\u2019m not sure that the amount of money that we\u2019re spending would have any material effect on our number of shares outstanding but we do think for the long-term success of our business we want to continue to invest and build these brands on a global basis.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I\u2019d say the long-term success clearly as Eric said and also to position ourselves to take advantage of some of the opportunities that we talked about earlier we expect to see as a result of this environment.  We think it\u2019s exactly the right time to spend behind our brands and make sure that they stay strong and we\u2019re able to take advantage of those opportunities as they arise.", "Evren Kopelman - J.P. Morgan", "Just to confirm, you did not buy back any stock in the third quarter, right?", "Robert K. Shearer", "That\u2019s correct.  We did not.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "Can you speak to the credit environment and the impact across your customer base of channel partners?  What are you seeing there and what are you doing to address any potential issues that might arise?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure Jim.  Bob would love to do that for you.", "Robert K. Shearer", "What we\u2019re hearing is probably the same thing that you\u2019re hearing from others, and that is some conservatism relative to the buys from retailers.  The way we respond to that is what we\u2019ve mentioned earlier, and that is making sure we keep our inventories low and clean.  That\u2019s the best thing that we can do.  We plan a little bit more cautiously clearly and again the area that\u2019s most critical there is the control of inventories.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "I guess what I was speaking more to is perhaps some risk to the receivables.  Are you making any further adjustments to your allowance for doubtful accounts, any change in terms with specific retailers that you\u2019re dealing with?", "Robert K. Shearer", "No change in terms, and if you look on our balance sheet you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve always taken what we believe is a pretty conservative view relative to our reserves associated with AR.  The other thing I\u2019d point out is that as of the end of September our days were actually down a day.  So yes, it means increased focus for sure on AR, staying on top of it.  Again we\u2019ve not changed terms and just a lot of pressure in terms of collecting.  So far we\u2019ve been able to manage through that.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "With regards to your outlook, in an environment like this how much faith are you putting in booking numbers?  Have you seen order cancelations?  What\u2019s kind of the wiggle room you\u2019ve given yourself based on the order book and the potential for cancelations?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "A lot of our [inaudible] revenue comes from replenishment so bookings are not critical to every piece of our business.  They are critical to some or more important to some pieces.  We\u2019ve not seen material cancelations of orders.  We just haven\u2019t seen that yet.  The discussions we\u2019re having about forward business with our customers are thoughtful and cautious, and we think that\u2019s the smart way for everybody to approach planning right now.  That\u2019s what our customers are doing and how we\u2019re approaching it as well.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "A point of clarification on your assumptions for comps in the fourth quarter.  Bob, I think you\u2019d said down a couple of percentage points.  Is that down from where it had been trending in the high single digits or down a couple percentage points on an absolute basis?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Down from where it had been trending.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners LLC", "I realize you\u2019re not prepared to speak in detail about \u201909 but I did have a follow up to Omar\u2019s question.  Philosophically if the revenue lines go backwards, what happens with advertising spend?   Do you still believe that if the environment gets even more difficult that it\u2019s the appropriate thing to do to continue to invest at the expense of the earnings line?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "We\u2019re not expecting our revenue line to go backwards.  We think our revenue line is going to grow in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s reflected in our decision to continue the investment in our brands.  I can\u2019t get into hypothetically what might happen next year at this time though.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I think the important point there is that when you look at the fourth quarter and just in terms of how we manage our overall costs, again we\u2019ve obviously been active on the cost reduction front and that\u2019s reflected in our fourth quarter.  So with the volume reduction from our previous guidance we\u2019re still looking at operating margins on an adjusted basis considering the restructuring in last year\u2019s quarter to be about flat.", "That\u2019s the way we continue to manage and again we reduced the anticipated volume and are still looking at those kinds of numbers.  We\u2019ll continue to look at other areas of spend so that we can spend behind the advertising dollars.  So there\u2019s not one specific point where we would stop the advertising spend but it\u2019s part of the overall equation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon Joseph - Wachovia.", "Shannon Joseph - Wachovia", "I was wondering if you could give a little more detail about your plans for repaying commercial paper, whether you plan to use cash flow or draw on your bank revolvers?  And also I was wondering if you could give an update on the Mo Industries\u2019 acquisition?  I know that you have an option to purchase the rest of that in early 2009.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I\u2019ll start on the commercial paper front.  We anticipate actually rolling over.  Now understand that we\u2019re at the high point.  At the end of the quarter it\u2019s our high point in terms of commercial paper and we begin generating a lot of cash in the fourth quarter.  We\u2019ve been seeing that and we paid down our commercial paper from that high point at the end of September.", "We do have some rollover requirement in the months of October and November.  For October we\u2019ve actually been able to cover most of that.  It\u2019s not easy to be sure.  The cost is a little bit up from what it would normally be as you can imagine, but on an opportunistic basis we have been able to roll the commercial paper over and we expect to be able to do that in November as well.  The biggest factor there is the strong cash generation so that we\u2019ll pay down the commercial paper by the end of the year.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "On the Mo Industries question, I\u2019m pleased to report that the Splendid and Ella Moss brand continue to perform well in this environment.  We\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s likely that we would complete this acquisition early next year and I think that\u2019s still the guidance that we would give; that\u2019s still our intention.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz - R.W. Baird & Company.", "Mitch Kummetz - R.W. Baird & Company", "Let me start with your outlook.  You\u2019ve talked about the revision there being attributable to external factors but as I look at the outlook across your coalitions it would seem that relative to what the outlook might have been as of the last quarter that Q4\u2019s coming down the most for jeanswear.  First of all, is that accurate?  And if that\u2019s the case, is that business more susceptible to the external factors?  Is it more of a function of the increased investment in that business that\u2019s being dragged down by maybe a lower sales rate than previously expected?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I\u2019m not sure what exactly you\u2019re looking at to come to that conclusion.  Our numbers would suggest that the fourth quarter was reduced by each of our businesses pretty proportionately.  There was not a big variation.  All of our business leaders are reacting to the economic and financial crisis that we\u2019ve all seen in the last four weeks and trying to react responsibly, but what we saw as we got our numbers in worldwide from all our businesses was pretty evenly distributed across the board.", "Mitch Kummetz - R.W. Baird & Company", "Thinking about it a little differently in terms of the revision to the fourth quarter outlook, is it more an impact on the international business than the US business because there\u2019s a bit of a double whammy there just in terms of currency coming in and then also just the global economic slowdown hurting the international business?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I don\u2019t think that the international business environment is necessarily more difficult than the business environment in the Americas, but yes there is a double whammy because we lost about 2% points of growth versus our prior forecast in the fourth quarter from currency conversion.  That does affect that as well.", "Mitch Kummetz - R.W. Baird & Company", "I know you don\u2019t really want to speculate on hypotheticals for 2090, but as I look at the currency impact I think you\u2019d said it was about a $0.05 to $0.06 add in Q3 and then going to about a $0.03 drag in Q4.  I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019d expect that if the Euro stays at $1.35 you\u2019d expect that to intensify into \u201909.  I\u2019m curious, given how you hedge that exposure where would the drag peak?  Is it kind of midway through the year assuming that we\u2019re staying at similar currency rates to where we\u2019re at today?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Again we really would prefer not to comment on that and more on that later.  I guess all I\u2019d caution you there is just be very careful because obviously the currency impact varies significantly by quarter.  So in the first part of the year it helped us a little bit more in the first quarter; not as much in the second quarter; a little bit more in the third quarter and obviously that has a lot to do with the fluctuations in our overall business.  So again we\u2019ll provide a lot more details on that a little later.", "Mitch Kummetz - R.W. Baird & Company", "Where would you expect your Q4 interest expense to come in?  And I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d expect your share count to stay pretty flat to where it was in Q3?", "Robert K. Shearer", "The net interest number in the fourth quarter should be right around $22 million.  Your assumption on share count being flat is accurate.", "Operator", "At this point Mr. Wiseman, there are no further questions.  I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you.", "Eric C.

Good afternoon, and thanks for participating in VF Corporations' fourth quarter and full year 2008 conference call. By now you should have received today's earnings press release.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual during our year end call we have coalition leaders with us today. So following the opening remarks by me and Bob Shearer we will hear from them about their business in the fourth quarter and their outlook for 2009.", "As you saw in this afternoon's release, 2008 marked our sixth consecutive year of record revenues in earnings per share, which in this market underscores what you can do when you have a great team managing a great business model.", "Now the past several years we have made a lot of change at VF. We have added growing higher margin lifestyle brands, we have expanded our direct to consumer and international businesses. And we have exited under performing businesses and these changes have resulted in a business model that is strong and resilient.", "On January 14th, we provided an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter. Today the reported revenues were down 2% as anticipated, while earnings per share were $1.5 which is at the high end of our guidance.", "Cash flow from operations came in stronger then we expected at $679 million versus our prior guidance of $650 million.", "We also provided preliminary guidance for 2009 which we are confirming today. Revenues will be down slightly in 2009 at a low to mid single digit rate while earnings per share are expected to be about flat with the $5.42 reported in 2008.", "In this environment we think this speaks volume in our confidence in our brand strength, our capacity to control cost to protect our profitability and most importantly the quality of our people.", "We enter 2009 with our balance sheet and liquidity in excellent chain. Our brand portfolio was healthy and a highly diversified and I remain very encouraged by our long-term opportunities for growth.", "And we remain interested in acquisition however we will be very disciplined as we consider additional acquisitions, never losing our focus on maintaining our strong balance sheet.", "We have indicated that we expect 2009 to be a very difficult year. We do not expect any improvement from the conditions we saw on the fourth quarter. No one can predict what the coming months will bring, but I have confidence in our continued ability to navigate through the challenges inherent in such uncertain times.", "You will recall that we achieved record results in the first three quarters of 2008. We were up against some pretty tough comparison as we enter 2009. It should be no surprise to you that we will have our difficult most difficult comparison in our first quarter, you will hear more about this from Bob in a moment.", "Throughout 2009, we will continue to aggressively manage cost and inventories while at the same time we will invest prudently in the best growth opportunities for our brands both here and abroad.", "And in 2009, we should have another year of very strong cash flow currently anticipated to be about $700 million. To hear more about our financial results here is Bob Shearer, Bob?", "Bob Shearer", "", "Thanks Eric. I will start with revenues which on a constant currency basis were flat in the quarter of 2007. Our reported revenues were down 2%, for the 2% was $39 million negative impact from foreign currency translations.", "Now as point of comparison, the average rate of the euro in 2008 quarter was 133 compared with 144 in last year's fourth quarter.", "Moving down to P&L gross margins decreased by 100 basis points, our expending retail business contributed positively to gross margins by about 170 basis points.", "Offsetting this positive impact were the following. One, the cost of aggressively managing inventories. Two, the unexpected and unfavorable movement of international currencies against the euro. And three, a highly promotional retail environment.", "Operating income declined by $71 million, with $41 million of the decline related to our cost reduction initiatives. Nearly all the $41 million is captured in the SG&A line and relates primarily to our cost reductions. As you are aware we have taken an aggressive approach to reducing cost and we expect that our actions will result in cost savings of $100 million annually beginning this year.", "In addition, to the expense of the cost reduction initiatives our SG&A ratios were impacted by an increase in advertising spend and higher volume in our owned retail stores.", "Foreign currency translations negatively impacted operating income year-on-year by $4 million. And the tax rate in the quarter was 24.1% versus 27.4% in last year's quarter and you recall that 2007 rate benefited by favorable tax resolution and we had a similar, although smaller benefit in this year's quarter.", "Our declining tax rate reflects the benefit of the growth in our highly profitable international businesses where our effective tax rates are substantially lower, this benefit will favorably impact future years as well.", "And that brings us to earnings per share. Our EPS was $1.05 in the quarter and that is at the high end of the guidance we gave back in January. The cost reduction actions impacted earnings per share by $0.30 while foreign currency translation cost was $0.02 per share in the quarter.", "Now turning to balance sheet, we are obviously very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet at year end, a strong cash position with low debt and substantial liquidity is a pretty good place to be considering the overall economic environment.", "Cash at year end was $382 million compared to $322 million at the end of 2007, our debt-to-capital ratio was 25% versus 26% at the end of 2007 and if cash is netted against outstanding debt that ratio will decline to below 20% at the end of 2008.", "We had no commercial paper borrowings at year end and of our total debt only 5% is due within one year.", "Inventories were only up slightly at year end and this is an area we will continue manage aggressively. In fact we expect some reductions in total inventories by the end of this year.", "Cash flow from operations was a very healthy $679 million above our most recent guidance of $650 million. And I should also point out 2008 marked our 36th consecutive year of higher dividend payments. Our dividend continues to be priority for us in providing strong shareholder returns.", "And now a few words about our guidance, we are planning for a challenging year, with the continuation of existing economic conditions. On a constant currency basis revenues in 2009 should be flat to down slightly.", "We indicated in our release, that reported revenues could be down by a low to mid single digit percentage rate reflecting a negative impact from currency translation of three to four percentage points.", "As a point of comparison, our current plan anticipates a euro rate of 133 compared with an average rate of 147 in 2008.", "We look forward to another year of record revenue in our outdoor and action sports business given the continued momentum of our brands. Revenues of our contemporary brands businesses are also expected to grow significantly. This reflects strong organic growth as well as the anticipated completion of the acquisition of the remaining two-thirds of Mo Industries Holdings, Inc;Owner of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands in the first half of 2009. Expecting continued challenges in the overall economic environment we anticipate modest revenue decline in jeanswear, sportswear, and image wear businesses.", "As you are aware our international business is concentrated in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses and our expectation for a stronger dollar will effect the comparisons in these businesses throughout 2009, with the greatest impact expected in the first and third quarters. Those are the periods when our international businesses are strongest.", "On a constant currency basis, we expect our international revenues to grow at mid to high single digit rate in 2009. Given our currency assumptions our international revenues on reported basis could be down slightly.", "In terms of our expectations for direct to consumer business this too has been in area of strong and consistent growth for VF. As we leverage the strength of our life style brands to expand our retail store base.", "During the year we opened the total of 89 stores that's right in line with our goal of opening 75 to 100 stores annually. For 2009, we are taking a more cautious approach to our store opening plan and currently anticipate opening approximately 70 stores.", "These openings will include new stores for our 7 For All Mankind, Vans and The North Face brands on a global basis. Our store expansion should again result in solid growth in our retail revenues and earnings in 2009 with the strongest contribution in second half of the year.", "And related to our expectations for margins in 2009 we expect to see a modest improvement in gross margins this year as we benefit from the on going change in our mix to a higher margin lifestyle businesses. And the continued expansion of our direct consumer businesses.", "Our expectations also reflect the continuation of a challenging economic environment. Operating margins are expected to improve by about 50 basis points in 2009 over the 12.3% reported in 2008.", "Now keep in mind that, that absorbs the impact of the substantially higher pension expense which by itself represents an approximate 120 basis points impact on operating margins.", "Now considering its unusual nature the increase of approximately $90 million in pension will be reported as a corporate expense in SG&A. So you will not see that impacting the reported results of our collations. The pension expense will be spread fairly equally across the next four quarters and finally a stronger dollar assumption and translating foreign currencies could impact operating income by $40 million to $45 million again the biggest impacts will be felt in our first and third quarters.", "Our tax rate in 2009 should be fairly comparable to the 28.9% reported in 2008, ranging between 28% and 30%. And that brings us to our EPS expectations for 2009.", "Earnings per share in 2009 should approximate for $5.42 reported in 2008 as we said in the release that includes the impact of the higher pension expense which will represent about $0.50 per share.", "In addition, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation included in our plans will be about $0.30.", "We also provided an outlook for the first quarter as Eric mentioned we will be up against very tough comparisons. The economic environment has clearly worsened since the first quarter of 2008. Accordingly we indicated in our release that first quarter revenues could be down by 5% to 7% for the 4% impact from foreign currency translations.", "Our pension and change in foreign currency translation rates will have significant impact on the comparability of our earnings on a quarterly basis. The pension expense impact earnings per share will approximate $0.11 to $0.12 each quarter.", "While the change in foreign currency translation rate will have the greatest impact on earnings in the first quarter and third quarters once again reflecting flow of international profits during the year. Accordingly, we expect that earnings per share in the first quarter will decline significantly reflecting an estimated combined impact of $0.20 per share from these two items.", "In addition, the movement of international currencies against the Euro will have a significant negative impact in Q1 versus last year's quarter.", "Now that's on top of the translational impact previously mentioned and of course the negative volume will also result in tougher comparisons in our first quarter. Accordingly, we currently expect that earnings per share for the quarter will approximate $0.90 to $0.95 compared with $1.33 per share reported in the first quarter of 2008.", "2009 should mark another strong year of cash flow for VF. We expect cash flow from operations of $700 million this year. Cash balances at year end could exceed $600 million.", "We have no significant long-term debt payments due until October 2010. In addition, we have $1.3 billion of available in unused lines of credit. We will continue to be very focused on managing our working capital and expect inventories to be down on a year-over-year basis.", "We also will be reducing capital expenditures in 2009 which should approximate $110 million compared with $125 million in 2008. All in all, we believe we are very well prepared to face the challenges of 2009.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks a lot Bob, we will begin now here in from the coalition President starting with Angelo LaGrega President of our Jeanswear Americas coalition.

Our global supply chain provides us with a strategic advantage as we effectively balance internal production with core sufficient sourcing.", "However, due to significant expenses associated with retail bankruptcy during the year and core reduction initiatives during the fourth quarter, operating margins declined in 2008.", "We showed number of successes with the Wrangler brand this year. In the mass channel we did see a shift to opening price when products including some private label. However innovative new fits and finishes particularly in our Wrangler Jeans company line, allowed us to gain new racks and floor space as we enter 2009.", "We also saw a very positive results from 250 Wrangler shops that will be expanded to over 1000 in 2009. We increased our ad spending during the year, launching successful campaigns with both Brett Favre and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. The introduction of our ultimate riding jeans for women was a huge success on our western channel.", "At Lee we faced particularly difficult conditions in the mid tier department store channel.

Leaving us with the best inventory position in years.", "I am realistic as we enter 2009, but optimistic as I consider our opportunities. There is no doubt this will be a challenging year. And in fact we expect our revenues in 2009 to be down slightly.", "We will focus on driving results to new product innovation and new distribution. Fortunately many of these concepts have been fully tested and validated in 2008, and we look leverage our successful flagship brands with existing and new customers.", "The decisions we made in 2008 allow us to enter 2009 with a very streamlined cost structure which together with our focus on revenue growth will support our efforts to deliver superior operating profits and cash flow to our shareholders.", "I remain very energized about what is happening at jeanswear. With some of the most recognized brands in the world. We have a great team of people in place to execute our strategies that are more focused than ever and understanding and giving consumers what they want.

The early mid on 2009 is that the retail environment made very challenging. 7 For All Mankind stores are performing inline with our expectations and we look forward to adding 9 to 15 new stores this year. However, the 7 For All Mankind wholesale business remained difficult to project as the better department store and specialty store customers continue to be very cautious for their future order commitments.

And we will take our first question from Robert Drbul, Barclays Capital.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Hey, Bob, how are you doing? ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Good. Good afternoon. I guess the first quarter is, is a specific question on cost savings added for the $100 million, is it fair just take $25 million on a quarter or is there any more detail in terms of how to think about that?", "Bob Shearer", "Bob, it grows throughout the year as you might imagine, so it's a little less in the first quarter and it grows throughout the year, so it will be more of an impact from the fourth quarter than the first. ", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then on the contemporary businesses, Mike, if you could talk a little bit more in term of I guess when you look at the business performance in the fourth quarter and the assumptions for 2009, I guess the first question is how much of the growth that you are projecting in contemporary comes from the Mo acquisition and the completion of the Mo acquisition. And then I think and then if you could maybe just put in a little bit more in terms of the organic assumptions that you have and perhaps like what you expect the retail business to contribute just to get the growth after seeing the fourth quarter performance in that business.", "Mike Egeck", "Let me speak to the organic growth question first, it is a very tough environment out there and our plans don\u2019t assume that it gets better, we are also not assuming its gets worse. So, the organic growth for 7 really comes from market share gains, from some very selective new distribution and from our own retail stores and our e-commerce. The timing on the Mo Industries acquisitions is still to be determined. So, we can't speak specifically to the growth from that particular acquisition or we do plan to complete it sometime in the first half of the year.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then on the inventories are there areas of inventories that you guys are concern with either at wholesale or at the retail level in terms of where the system is right now from the orders etcetera any cancellations that you are concerned about as you look at the first half of this year?", "Mike Egeck", "No, Bob, are you asking a both that retail and what we have internally is that your question, yes, actually our inventories again we have seen improvement throughout the year and something that we thought about actually early in the year, and it really varied by channel of distribution, specific actions we are taking to align inventories. ", "So, right now we feel pretty good about the inventories at the retail level and as we said our inventories that we are holding were relatively flat in the year. And what I would also add to that is that actually the quality of those inventories or even a little bit better. So in other words when we match up the inventories against anticipated sales on a near end basis, we like what we see relative to the quality. So, we did, we took a lot of steps, it costs us in the fourth quarter to be sure, we took a lot of steps to get those inventories in line and we are very aggressive in doing so and that\u2019s why the quality is there and that\u2019s also how the level got where it is.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "", "And then, just my last question is on the jeanswear businesses. So when you look at the loss of Mervyn's and Goodies. How much of your revenue base goes away in 2009, has you even begin the year with the loss of those two partners?", "Eric Wiseman", "", "We won't talk about that specifically. What we will tell you about is that relative to all of these factors and maybe other retailers that maybe a bit more trouble.

What is your strategy for 2009 for pricing the 7 brands? I know one of your competitors lowered their prices on some of the more higher in jeans, is this something you would consider doing or you planning on cutting the number of styles offered?", "Mike Egeck", "", "Hi, this is Mike and I will take that question. We had there some of our competitors drop their price, we do not believe that\u2019s the correct thing to do and based on what we know on the reactions from the retail community that we serve it's not the right thing to do. What we are seeing is we are seeing softness in jeans over $200. We run our product and price range from about $150 to over a $300, what we have done is increased the offering we have between $150 to $200, that seems to be the right answer for matching consumer demand at the moment.", "Kate McShane - Citi", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And I was little surprised here that you are still opening 70 stores this year, and although its opening at a slower rate its still just below the low end of, generally where you see opening stores. Are you continuing to open because of the benefit you might get on the leases?

We had the intention of opening 100 this year. Last summer, we are beginning to plan this year. We dialed that fact by about 30%, 70 that\u2019s our target number of stores. We obviously don\u2019t have all of those committed to but its lowering than what we have done has the economy not turned the way it is, its straight situation because there is some terrific lease opportunities out there. And we have to be very thoughtful that when we pulled that trigger with which brands and in which markets, but we will do that and get 70 by the end of the year we think.

And our portfolio of brands was getting pretty big, and the reality is that the outdoor world and the action sports while they have somethings in common, there is more that they have that our separate terms of kinds of consumer, where they sell and which channels and trade shows they go to.

Is it all cost cutting or can you just give me sort of the basis large pieces on the gross margin in SG&A side that get me there and what is supposedly pretty tough environment. Thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, just looking at the individual pieces, again this is full-year '09. In the gross margin area just as we have been seeing our retail business and expansion in retail will help drive the gross margins up there. So, again considering the overall climate and the comparisons of first quarter, second quarter and how that trended throughout the year. We think overall that gross margins might expand 50 basis points to 200 basis points, again with a large piece of that being driven by the retail expansion. ", "In the SG&A side, again a little bit of a mix bag just as you pointed out. So  once again retail we will drive the SG&A percentages up somewhat not as strong as the gross margin obviously. So, we expect some improvement there in retail profitability. And then yeah, the cost reduction as the significant benefit and the pension is an offset to that. So, overall the SG&A will be up to a lesser extent and gross margins maybe flat to 50 basis point, so that\u2019s how we net out to the 50.", "Robert Ohmes - Banc of America", "", "Thanks a lot.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "You bet.", "Operator", "", "We go next to Eric Tracy with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Eric Tracy - BB&T Capital Markets", "", "Good afternoon.

So, that\u2019s why we specifically made a comments Eric, we are going to capture the big increase in pension and in corporate expenses because of its nature.

We do expect and again this is I am always careful to say this, we do expect operating margins within jeanswear to improve 2009 versus 2008 and that's a result of number of things and the cost reductions and initiatives that we took are obviously a piece of that. Again remember that our jeans business is a global jeans business. The numbers that we put on jeanswear are globally.

You see on the gross margin standpoint do you see jeanswear costs to be going down substantially as well to help offset some of the promotional pressures you might be seeing?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, again from the restructuring initiatives, you know the cost, the cost will go down from a product cost standpoint. We expect cost to be relatively stable.", "Christina Chang - Susquehanna", "And then do you expect to, how do you expect position your domestic jeanswear brand should given, how consumers are behaving, the fact that, I should say they are shifting towards more opening price point products. Are you thinking of going either lowering over your price point or are you thinking of putting more features product and go down maintain your current price level?", "Angelo LaGrega", "I will take that this is Angelo, based we have a couple things going on within our business.

First of all, that mid tier channel is only relatively small part of our overall mix. We have a very balanced distribution base with the core and life style and Mo and our own retail. So, we are not actually exposed to anyone channel becoming particularly promotional. But in any case we have not really seen it with our brand.", "So, it's really just not something that we had to concern our selves with yet. Just to borrow little bit of what Angelo has said about jeanswear. We have been same team. The pricing of Vans shoes particularly is really not prohibitive given the great scheme of things within the overall athletic footwear world.

One of the challenges that we pointed out in my comments is that, what we are seeing right now is what other companies are experiencing the same thing, is some of the fluctuations and within currencies within Europe or countries that are in and around Europe. So for example, the pound. The pound has valued significantly against euro. We hold inventories in euros and when we sold those products in the UK that does impact our profitability.

When we acquired the lucy brand it was headed in direction toward more casual women sportswear and we acquired the brand because the Lucy name does have authenticity in the activity base particularly around yoga and gym.

Could we say how much of your overall business is driven off of pre-book orders versus reorders and what is your ability to chase assuming, with the possibility out there that maybe the environment does improve a little bit. What is your ability to chase and maybe gets some incremental reorder business relative to your guidance?", "Eric Wiseman", "", "That's a really good question, and it's a really nearly almost impossible one to answer as it differs by business by market, and we think of the number of brands we sell in the number of product categories we sell, the number of countries do we sell it is very different.", "Our jeans wear business can change,  basic products very, very efficiently and caught up in a very short window of time. On more technical, outer wear goods around the North Face a lot of that stuff is pre-booked in advance, and we purchase to our book to our order book, and it is very tough to chase some of that some of that stuff there, so it's hard to give an answer that will meaningful as the percentage of the answer around the world. It\u2019s also different getting goods into Russia or China versus Italy or the US.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird", "", "Okay. That's fare enough. All right that's all I had, thanks and good luck.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Thanks, Mitch.", "Operator", "It appears there are no more questions at this time.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "If there is no more questions, I thank you all for joining us on the call, appreciate your support in 2008, and we are going to get back to making 2009 happen.

Corporation second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Please be aware that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana of ICR. Please go ahead.", "Jean Fontana", "Good afternoon, thanks for participating in the V.F. Corporation second quarter 2009 conference call. By now you should have received today\u2019s earnings press release, if not please call 203-682-8200 and we will get you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting the call this afternoon is Mr. Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of V.F.", "Before we begin, we would like to remind participants certain statements included in today\u2019s remarks and the Q-and-A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. ", "Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations or financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company in the SEC.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019ll start the call today with a few opening comments. Then we\u2019ll have Bob Shearer walk through our financial results. We also have with us today Karl Heinz Salzburger, who is President of our international business, who will provide a quick update on our Asia business; as well as Aidan O\u2019Meara who is President of our Asia Pacific business, who\u2019s going to speak more specifically about China.", "Now there\u2019s no question that conditions remain very challenging and our results this quarter reflect that. Having said that we remain confident in our business model and strategies and we do see signs that conditions have begun to stabilize. We noted in today\u2019s release that we are comfortable with maintaining our full year revenue and earnings guidance.", "On our first quarter release we indicated that our second quarter revenue and earnings comparisons would likely be the most difficult of the year, even more difficult than what we experienced in the first quarter. Revenues were down more in the second quarter than in the first. However, our earnings decline was in fact less, which we found encouraging as a testament to our focus on controlling costs and reducing inventories. ", "There were several items in the quarter that I would like to touch upon particularly as they relate to our key strategic growth drivers. Let me talk for a moment about the performance of our four largest brands, Wrangler, The North Face, Lee and Vans. As combined they represent about 60% of our total revenue base. ", "Starting with our two big Jeans brands Wrangler and Lee the second quarter was clearly more difficult for us than the first, but in the U.S. market revenues of our two big brands, Wrangler and Lee, were down 6% and 4% respectively, but we indicated in our release that second quarter results were not indicative of what we expect for the second half of the year. ", "There were a number of factors pointed out in the release that were specific to the second quarter, that should be partially mitigated in the second half of the year as we rollout new programs and roll into our important fall core denim season. We continue to gain share on our biggest core denim businesses and those businesses are the most important to us in the upcoming season.", "In addition, we are definitely seeing signs of stabilization in our European jeans business and believe that\u2019s the most difficult comparisons are behind us there. We are also looking forward to continued strong growth in Asia. Our two big Outdoor and Action Sports brands, The North Face and Vans continue to have solid momentum and are clearly outperforming the mark.", "To reiterate, a couple of facts that is in the release, during the quarter on a currency adjusted basis, global revenues of the North Face brand were up 4%, while Vans revenues rose 14% with increases both domestically and internationally. In this environment, those are results we are proud of and we are. We continue to support the growth of these brands with investment in new store openings and international expansion.", "Of course retail and international expansion are two significant growth drivers for us. Our retail revenues grew 4% in the second quarter and first six months of the year. While we don\u2019t normally comment on comp store performance for our stores, I believe it\u2019s worth noting that Vans stores posted positive comp store gains in the quarter, which is why we\u2019re investing in additional Vans stores this year.", "If you recall that in 2008, our direct-to-consumer business accounted for 16% of total revenues. This year, with quite deep recessionary conditions, our direct-to-consumer business will continue to grow and should approximate 17% of total revenues. So we continue to make progress toward achieving our long term goal of 22%. International revenues were down 4% in the quarter in constant dollars and 5% for the first six months of the year.", "However, we did see international revenues increase in our Vans, 7 For All Mankind, The North Face and Kipling brands on a constant dollar basis. You\u2019ll hear much more today about our success in Asia, but we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum that we have there. Now, these successes while gratifying did not obscure the fact that we experienced steep revenue and operating income declines in most of our businesses during the quarter. We anticipated this, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier.", "However, with this very difficult quarter behind us we\u2019re now looking forward to easier to that and bottom line comparisons in the second half of the year. I should point out that we do not expect improving market trends. Indeed unemployment is expected to continue to increase in the coming months and consumer spending is likely to remain quite depressed.", "There is a much speculation about big inventory reductions by retailers and the possibility of revenue and earnings balance later this year for both retailers and wholesalers, if restocking and in response to a pickup in demand becomes necessary. While we believe retailers are doing everything they can to minimize inventory risk in this environment, we believe it\u2019s too early to speculate about the effects of a possible improvement in consumer demand. We will continue to work closely, with our retail partners to keep inventories lien and to protect our profits.", "In summary, we believe we\u2019re well prepared to navigate our way through the second half of 2009. The most difficult comparisons should be behind us and we remain highly focused on achieving our plans for the balance of the year. ", "We will remain vigilant on cost and inventory. We will continue to make prudent investments behind our biggest growth opportunities. We will continue to explore opportunities to add new brands to our portfolio and we will maintain and protect our balance sheet.", "Now let\u2019s hear from Bob.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks, Eric. On the service revenues which were down 11% in the quarter with foreign currency translation accounting for three percentage points of the decline. Our gross margins this quarter rose 10 basis points to 43.9%. We\u2019re benefiting from expanding gross margins in our Outdoor and Action Sports businesses and that\u2019s a testament to the strength of those brands.", "In addition, our own retail operations continued to contribute positively to the gross margin comparisons. We were really pleased with the improvement in this area considering the pressures that this environment places on overall gross margins. SG&A as a percent of revenues rose 180 basis points, of this increase 140 basis points is related to higher pension expense.", "With the remainder, do to our continued investments in growing our retail store base that obviously implies that outside of these factors, our SG&A relationships are remaining stable, despite the revenue decline resulting from this challenging environment. The aggressive cost reduction actions that we initiated at the end of 2008 are clearly paying off. ", "The tax rate in the quarter was 25% that was right on track with our expectation. We continue to realize the benefit of substantially lower effective tax rates from our international businesses. For the full year, we anticipated a tax rate of about 27% and that brings us to earnings per share. ", "We said last quarter that we anticipated our second quarter would reflect the toughest comparisons for the year in earnings per share. That implied obviously, that a decline in a quarter will exceed the 31% reported in the first quarter. In fact, the decline was slightly less at 28%. Improvement came primarily from one, the strong results posted by our Outdoor and Action Sports coalition and secondly, better than anticipated results in jeans wear. ", "Related to coalition results, as we did last quarter we concluded a table with the release that provides revenues and profits on an as reported and constant currency basis. As the coalition results, I\u2019ll begin with Outdoor and Action Sports, another solid quarter year. Reported revenues were down 2%, however, adjusting for currencies revenues actually rose by 2% with increase in both American and international businesses. ", "The main drivers of growth were our two big brands, The North Face and Vans where revenues were up 4% and 14% respectively on a constant currency basis. Also as noted in the release, we experienced strong growth in our Asia and direct-to-consumer businesses where we saw revenue increases of 32% and 19% respectively for this coalition. Operating margins in Outdoor and Action Sports were strong in the quarter arriving by more than one full percentage point despite continuing investments to expand our direct-to-consumer business reflecting the higher gross margins that I referenced earlier.", "Looking forward, we expect stronger second half comparisons for our Outdoor and Action Sports coalition, driven by our growing and owned retail business, which is seasonally strongest in the second half and continued expansion in operating margins. ", "Now, turning next to jeanswear; Eric made a few comments about our Wrangler and Lee brands at the beginning of the call. Just to reiterate what was in the release, total jeanswear revenues in the quarter were down by 12%, that\u2019s again in constant dollars. However, we are encouraged by the fact that we continued to gain share in our Wrangler men\u2019s, Lee men\u2019s and women\u2019s and our core Riders women\u2019s businesses driven by the success of new product innovations and shop and shop investments at retail in these brands.", "Now there were several factors that affected revenues that were specific to the second quarter. First was a reduction in certain non-core Riders brand programs including seasonal and plus size programs. Now, this reduction has the biggest impact in the second quarter especially related to the seasonal products and will be less in subsequent quarters. We also noted a shift in the timing of product shipments with our customers continuing to tightly manage the flow of products.", "Finally, all of you are aware of the Goody\u2019s and Mervyn\u2019s bankruptcies last year, which has resulted in a loss of volume this year. Our conditions continue to be difficult in Europe, but we are seeing signs of stabilization. In fact the sharp declines in the Eastern Europe and Scandinavia markets that we discussed last quarter have moderated and these markets are now seeing declines more in line with the rest of Europe.", "Our international revenues declined 12% in constant dollars in the quarter, reflecting difficult market conditions and to a lesser degree, the ongoing exit of our mass jeans business. Now a bright spot in the quarter, were China where jeanswear revenues rose 10%. ", "Despite the drop in revenues and operating income, we did see our jeanswear operating margins improved a bit in the quarter a benefit of our cost reduction actions. We do expect better comparisons in the second half of this year and than experienced in the second quarter for our global jeanswear businesses keeping in mine the factors specific to the quarter. ", "In the first quarter revenues in constant dollars were down by only 1%. For the first half in total, jeanswear revenues in constant dollars declined by about 6%. So, comparing first half to second half revenues, we expect that second half comparisons in constant dollars will be more inline or even somewhat better than those in the first half, and certainly much better than those reported in the second quarter.", "On a reported basis second half revenues should be down at high single-digit percentage rate. Now we remain cautious about the outlook for our European jeans business. We\u2019ve seen significant declines in retailers open to buys versus last year and while market conditions have stabilized, they are expected to remain week. Having said all that, our brand and product repositioning efforts for Wrangler and Lee in Europe are nearly complete and we are gaining new distribution.", "Despite challenging market conditions, we are well-positioned in Eastern Europe which we continue to view as a good market for us longer term. Asia offers outstanding potential and our business there enjoys not only extraordinary growth but strong profitability as well. ", "Now a few words about sportswear; we continue to feel the effect of a very weak and promotional environment, department stores, which is impacting our Nautica brand. Our retail partners are focusing heavily on value pricing and holding their open to buy for in season purchases. A few other factors contributing to the revenue decline were said in the release include a planned decrease in special programs in the off price channel and our exit of the women\u2019s wholesale business in mid 2008. ", "On the positive side our launch and all Lord & Taylor doors is a success and our business there is running above our plan. It\u2019s also worth noting that our Kipling revenues in the US rose by 3% in the quarter. ", "Now looking towards the second half of the year there again, we expect to see improved comparisons on both to that and bottom lines, reductions in our special program business and the exit of the women\u2019s line accounted for over 60% of the decline in first half revenues for this brand.", "While our sales of Nautica products to off price channels will be down for the full year, second half comparisons will include an increase in this business, which is already booked on a lower impact from the exited women\u2019s business as we close that business in the first half of last year and we continue to anticipate double-digit margins as we benefit from aggressive actions taken to reduce both inventories and cost.", "Turning now to our contemporary brands business, revenues were up 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis in the quarter with the increase due to the acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands. ", "The acquisition added $16 million in revenues in the quarter while all retail channels of distribution are challenging upper tier department and specialty stores have been particularly weak. In fact the number of specialty stores is declining at an accelerated rate and that a high number of specialty stores that existed at the beginning of the year have been closed due to the tough economic environment.", "In terms of the Coalitions largest brand, 7 For All Mankind, global revenues declined 12% in the quarter or 8% in constant dollars. As noted in the release, a decline in our U.S. wholesale business was partially offset by significant growth in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses. In addition we continue to reduce our sales to the off price channel.", "During the quarter our revenues in this channel declined by 25% and we expect a similar decline through the year in total. While this loss of revenue hurts our comparisons, we believe reducing our business in this channel was the right strategy to maintain the high integrity of the 7 For All Mankind brand.", "Our global expansion strategy for the 7 For All Mankind brand continues to be relevant and shows progress. For example, international revenues rose 34% in constant dollars in the quarter and our direct-to-consumer business more than tripled in the quarter. ", "Globally year-to-date we\u2019ve opened six retail stores with a total of 20 planned for the year. We\u2019ve tested Splendid and Ella Moss products in several 7 For All Mankind stores with strong results and we\u2019ll be rolling these products out to additional stores during the year, and we\u2019ll be opening our first Splendid store in LA, in the third quarter as planned.", "Now, there was a particularly challenging quarter for this Coalition in terms of operating income and margins. The second quarter is the Coalition\u2019s seasonally lowest revenue quarter, magnifying the impact of the volume reduction. ", "In terms of the second half of the year, we expect strong revenue growth driven by the addition of the Ella Moss and Splendid brand. We\u2019ll also benefit from additional new store opening remarks and continued growth internationally in our 7 For All Mankind brand. Margins should return to double digit levels as our inventories will be much better aligned at retail and accordingly we should see a lesser impact from customer inventory adjustments.", "Finally a few commence on our Imagewear business. There\u2019s no question that the second quarter was a challenging one for our Imagewear Coalition, with revenues down 19% and comparable declines in both our Image and Licensed Sports businesses. As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s call, our Image business has been hurt this year by particularly high unemployment rates in sectors that have impacted our industrial uniform and protective apparel businesses.", "While unemployment rates continue to rise, the rates of increase have slowed considerably. Our License Sports business also had difficulty revenue comparisons in the quarter. The decline in revenues here reflects the weak retailing environment, which has particularly impacted sales of discretionary products like team sports apparel. ", "While we don\u2019t expect improvement in the employment picture in the seconds half of the year, we do see easier comparisons in both the Image and License Sports businesses, as we anniversary a difficult seconds half last year that followed very strong first half in 2008.", "Now on a broader VF scale, Eric touched on our retail and international performance. I should add that we\u2019re on track to open at least our targeted number of 70 stores this year, with 17 stores opened in the second quarter and 36 stores opened year-to-date. Our balance sheet, liquidity and cash flow continue to strengthen. In terms of our balance sheet and cash flow, we noted in the release that we had $385 million in cash and equivalents at the end of June, above the $276 million at the end of June 2008.", "Our focus on reducing inventories is really paying off with inventories down 9% from prior year levels. Reducing inventories will remain a big focus for us in the second half of the year and we continue to expect that our year end inventories will be down 10% or by $100 million from year end 2008 levels. ", "This reduction in inventories is helping to drive strong cash flow from operations, which should exceed $750 million this year. It bears repeating too, that our liquidity remains strong with $1.1 billion available in lines of credit no long term debt payments due until late 2010 and then only $200 million is due.", "In terms of our guidance as Eric noted, we\u2019re still anticipating that revenues will decline 5% to 7%, with currency translation accounting for about 3% of the decline. Last quarter we also talked about the transactional effects. Most of the translational effects of currency on our results nicely anticipated, the major impact was in the first quarter and we do not anticipate any material transactional currency impact in the second half.", "In terms of earnings per share, we\u2019re holding to our current rates of $4.70 to $5, despite somewhat better than anticipated earnings in the second quarter and upside from currency as the euro rate has improved from our prior expectation of 130. We think it\u2019s prudent to maintain our guidance at this time given the uncertainty and challenges in global economic conditions.", "Now, with the first half behind us, this guidance implies that second half comparisons will improve over those of the first half. As Eric indicated in his opening and in the press release, comparisons are expected to improve as we anniversary a challenging second half last year. ", "In addition, while currency will be less of an impact in the second half versus first, it will be a significant impact in the third quarter considering first that this is the biggest quarter in both revenues and profits for our international business and second, currency rate differences.", "I would also remind you as you considered your estimates for the third quarter last year\u2019s third quarter included a net benefit of about $0.07 from favorable tax settlements. Now recall too that our fourth quarter results last year were impacted by $0.30 in cost reduction actions that we won\u2019t have this year. So, fourth quarter earnings comparisons should be the strongest of the year.", "So, that wraps up my comments. Let\u2019s hear an update from Karl Heinz Salzburger on our Asia Pacific business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Bob. Currently, our own businesses are concentrated in the fastest growing Asian economies, China and India, both of which have very good prospects for sustained future growth. The more mature markets like Japan and Korea, we had more limited back exposure and we worked predominantly to partner either distributors or licensees.", "Most of our brands have a presence in all countries, throughout the region with this partner. There is a total Asia revenue based which should approximate to $300 million this year, approximately half was generated in China. Our two largest businesses are Jeanswear and [Inaudible] accounting for 45% and 20% respectively, with the remainder coming from our Kipling brands and 7 for All Mankind.", "We move from using licensees to building our own platform in the region starting in \u201895 when we launched the Lee brand in China. We followed with a launch of Wrangler in 2003. 2006 we formed a majority owned joint venture in India to enable the growth of our brands there.", "In \u201807 we converted our license to North Face business in China to advance model and those have formed a joint venture with Mitsui for our Napapijri Brand in Japan. Our Vans brand launched in China just last year with excellent results to-date and this year we formed a new subsidiary in Japan for our contemporary brands and also converted our Kipling business in China, from a distributor to an owned business.", "During the past several years, we have focused heavily on building our capabilities in Asia, and our efforts have paid off with a 44% compound annual growth rate in revenues from \u201806 to \u201809. ", "In terms of our most recent results, in the second quarter our Asia business rose 13% and is up 18% year-to-date. The slower growth in the second quarter versus the first and the revenues are 24%. Due to the timing of shipment, we continue to expect our revenues this year to be up about 25%.", "Stronger growth we expect in the second half is due to continued strong brand momentum, particularly in China, as we increased our investments and market gain for our Feeder North Face, Lee and Vans brands; additional door openings and easier comparisons versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, when global market conditions deteriorated.", "India is an important opportunity for us, as we\u2019re taking a more patient approach there as a more organized recent distribution network evolves. We are prepared to accelerate our efforts there when the time is right. We will also proactively develop our partnerships in all other markets; we see many growth opportunities with our licensees and distributors, particularly in Southeast Asia. ", "We are organized to capture potential in Asia, the great brands in the talented management team. We are confident that we can ultimately build a 1 billion business there. China will be the key driver of that door and right now Aidan O\u2019Meara will speak more about the opportunities. ", "Aidan O'Meara", "Thank you, Karl. Our business in China is up 27% Year-to-date is expected to be up 30% this year. We\u2019ve been growing organically by expanding the footprint for our established brands there particularly The North Face and Lee. 2009 will mark the first full year for our Vans brand in China and are very pleased with the traction to that brands has with results exceeding our initial expectations.", "This year in China we expect to add about 250 doors across our brand bringing us to a total of 1,000 doors including counters by year end. 20% of which we own and operator all in tier 1 cities. Looking to the future, we are focused on achieving market leadership in three key categories, action sports, outdoor and jeans, where we have strong brands with proven relevance to Chinese consumers.", "Over 80% of the growth we are planning in China over the next five years will come from our Lee, The North Face and Vans brand. Same time we will continue to selectively bring other V.F. brands on to our platform as we are with Kipling this year.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Aidan. As you heard the second quarter was every bit as challenging as we anticipated. However, we are confident in the V.F. model, realistic in our expectations for the second half and we are confirming our guidance for revenue and earnings for this year.", "At this time we will take any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research.", "I was wondering if you could breakdown how much of your gross margin improvement was during the quarter from mix and how much was from the new retail doors you opened?", "Bob Shearer", "In the quarter, the second quarter you asked about, right.", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research.", "Yes, please.", "Bob Shearer", "There was about a 40 basis points improvement from retail.", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research.", "Although sales were a bit weaker than we were expecting margins were much better than we were expecting so can you quantify how much cost saving contributed to margins this quarter and how should we think about the impact of cost savings for the rest of the year.", "Bob Shearer", "Yes, as we said earlier in the year, related to the $100 million, first of all we are still on track to achieving that and as we said and as we were achieving and as we get throughout the year we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re on track, not only for $100 million, but also to see that relatively evenly split over the four quarters. ", "So, in the first half you got about half of that. Second half we expect to get to about half of it and again on a quarter-to-quarter basis it\u2019s pretty evenly split. So, that\u2019s been a significant factor. Things like, things like the pension, the increase in the pension expense, stand out obviously a little bit more in the second quarter than they do other quarters because it\u2019s just a smaller quarter.", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research", "Any opportunities potentially find more cost savings in the second half?", "Bob Shearer", "Again, we always have opportunities to reduce our costs. I know that many companies might say the first places they\u2019re going to go is in the advertising expense area, but that\u2019s not where we look. We\u2019re looking other spots. So yes, we could reduce our expenses, but we\u2019re working hard to protect the advertising spend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Eric, I just got on just like one big picture question and I have a couple of sort of finer tuned questions. First, in the press release and when you talked about a little bit, you talked about some signs of stabilization. When you look at it from the portfolio of the total business globally, can you maybe just give us one or two of your biggest stabilization data points that gives you the most encouragement as you look to the back half of this year?", "Eric Wiseman", "I know Bob, VF really well, so you know how complicated it is to make statements about all of our brands on a global basis, some data points, though. The health of the Vans brand and the fact that Vans brand had a good wholesale business globally and positive comps. Now, the positive comps aren\u2019t as high as they were a year ago, but they are running at about the same kind of positive levels for the first part of this year. So, that tells me that there\u2019s some stabilization.", "We see it in some of our own stores, where our trend line has flattened out a little bit lately. So, those are two indications that we have. We obviously, have pretty good look at bookings for the fall. Now our business is for bookings and replenishment, but bookings look like people are planning trends to be about where they are today. Does that help you, Bob?", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Planning where they are in terms of the run rate of the second quarter for the businesses?", "Eric Wiseman", "The recent run rate for those businesses is yes.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "When you talk about, I guess same thing and when you talk about bookings for the sportswear segment, is that down about the same run rate for the back half of the year, as what you just saw in the second quarter? I guess can you give us a North Face booking for the fall period?", "Eric Wiseman", "The answer to the question about Nautica is, yes, since the bookings are about the same rate we\u2019ve seen. The bookings for fall are at about the same run rate as they have been. I honestly don\u2019t know off the top of my head, Bob, what the North Face bookings are for fall.", "Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then just one more question for me is on the retail business, the direct-to-consumer, when you talk about all the positives, what\u2019s been the biggest disappointment as you guys have gone through the first half of the year on your own retail business?", "Eric Wiseman", "I\u2019m struggling to think of a biggest disappointment. I don\u2019t think that any of our retail stores are significantly under performing their space. That means that, I can\u2019t think of a biggest disappointment, Bob. I mean, because I have to compare them to other specialty retail and we\u2019re not underperforming our competitors in that area; and in most cases we\u2019re doing better.", "Bob Shearer", "Bob, to that point, what we said was that we were going to be opening stores on a more cautious basis this year end, and in those formats that have proven themselves a very successful. So, that to me means we are not doing a lot of testing with other brands. We\u2019re again opening stores where the results and returns have been strong, so no real disappointments from that standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Slater - Lazard Capital.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital", "When do you think the retail channels will be clean enough and inventory aligned enough where the demand you can actually start to see actual increases in open to buy or in order growth? Perhaps maybe you could look at it from both the U.S. and sort of the rest of world perspective for us. ", "Eric Wiseman", "I think we can comment best on the U.S. picture. I think that our retail partners, most of the suppliers, including us, have done a really good job over the last six to nine months to get inventories inline with plans and by that, Todd, I mean that our inventories are inline with what everybody is predicting to have happen in the business. We don\u2019t have any situations that I\u2019m aware of where we have inventories out of line and are hoping to work through them before the fall season happens.", "Everybody is pretty much where they want to be. I think the retailers have done a good job with that and it\u2019s reflected some in our revenue line, because they have purchased from us less than they\u2019ve been selling for awhile to get in that position, but it\u2019s the right place to be. Our inventories are also inline. We mentioned earlier we were going to reduce our inventories this year by $100 million and we\u2019re on track to do that.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital", "Right, but your inventories are inline. The retailers are maybe getting better aligned, but they\u2019re not yet increasing orders, or their open to buys aren\u2019t increasing. When do you think they will be at a comfort level where they can start growing orders again, fall is going to be down. Do you think spring still will be down, but down less or flattening out, or maybe even up? I\u2019m just curious, what\u2019s your viewpoint?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, for Fall I think we are aligned with whatever with each retailer based on their plan. I don\u2019t think anybody is going to bet and get out of in front of that. I think everybody is going to chase and we look forward to it.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital", "So, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if open to buys are still down for spring?", "Eric Wiseman", "I don\u2019t know, how I think we\u2019re going to learn a lot about that in the next 90 days to 120 days.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "I wanted to ask you about the gross margin line. Really solid number and I think you\u2019re up a little bit. I know there\u2019s some mix shift going on in there, but still up year-over-year in this environment. Inventories were down more than they were last quarter. ", "Talk about the sourcing out of the equation, you have kind of some of these retailers out there talking about huge sourcing opportunities with deflation year-over-year and the inflation we were seeing last year in the second half. What kind of opportunity is that for you or if you guys already so efficient that that\u2019s not necessarily as big as an opportunity.", "Bob Shearer", "First of all, we didn\u2019t see the big increases like some did in the first half of the year and I think we probably talked about that in the past. What we are seeing and built into our prior guidance was some improvement in the second half. So, yes, our costs were down in the second half of the year.", "Clearly built into the numbers in the second half of the year, we do expect to see improvements in our overall margins year-over-year for sure. So, that it keeps us kind of even on a full year basis, which again in this environment we think is pretty strong. So going forward, we\u2019ll see. ", "We still have a lot of negotiating yet to be done, but for us again, we just never had the big increases; seeing some improvements in the second half, and we are just going to keep pushing on it.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "How much of that gross margin improvement is kind of less promotional environment, or is it versus kind of a sourcing opportunity?", "Bob Shearer", "In the second half, I would say it\u2019s a little more heavily weighted to the promotional environment; and last year, especially in the fourth quarter we talked about some actions that we took to align inventories and that always costs us as well in the gross margin. So I would say it\u2019s a little bit more heavily weighted for that than the cost side; but costs are a factor.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Okay and then a question on kind of the M&A environment, there is the Eddie Bauer transaction that has been in the press recently, what the financing out there looks like, how you feel about that what to any extent you can provide insight on what your thought process was with Eddie Bauer, would be helpful?", "Eric Wiseman", "Related to the financing, Omar, again with our credit rating, we\u2019re in good shape. We have access to financing for sure and at better rates than most. So, financing is not a challenge for us. It\u2019s not holding us back from making appropriate acquisitions. As a matter of fact, again capacity is good and also the rates where they are today and also are more compelling. Is that what you were looking for?", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "So, what is holding you back? Are you still seeing the same opportunities? Do you still want to be aggressive or less aggressive given kind of the uncertainty out there? Are prices still too high?", "Eric Wiseman", "I would say that we\u2019re aggressive. There are plenty of opportunities. We\u2019re actively involved in many discussions. We obviously pursued the Eddie Bauer opportunity unsuccessfully.", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "One last question, the announcement of the new Board Director, was there an opening on the Board or just more of a strategic addition, kind of given changing focus of the company going more international?", "Eric Wiseman", "Our Board and our Nominating and Governance Committee has kind of an ongoing succession planning process. We\u2019re always scanning for new candidates and we added Rick Carucci to our Board today, recognizing that we have some upcoming retirements on our Board.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan.", "Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan", "Question on the jeanswear coalition, the margins were a lot better than we expected, especially compared to the first quarter when margins were down 400 basis points. Can you talk about, what drove the up operating margins, especially in light of the weaker top line performance compared to Q1?", "Bob Shearer", "Evren, this is Bob. Sure, it\u2019s evidence of the cost reduction efforts. So, that\u2019s a big part of it and running the business very, very cleanly, especially from an inventory standpoint. As you know, excess inventories can really impact the margins in a big way. We\u2019re always quick to provide for any excess inventories and our cost reduction efforts that we initiated at the end of last year are, as I said in my comments are really helping us and really paying off.", "Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan", "Then similar question on the Outdoor Coalition; again, margins were up compares to Q1 when they were down, which also is surprising, given I think last year you had talked about the seasonality of the retail business for the weakness in the second quarter end margins? Again, can you talk a little bit about, what drove those strength in margins in this quarter?", "Bob Shearer", "Number one, our gross margin is a little bit different there. Again, we obviously did take a number of cost reductions and cost control actions there as well, but in our outdoor business, most of that resulted from improvements in our gross margins.", "Evren Kopelman - JP Morgan", "", "Finally, what for the Euro, what do you assume for the second half what rate?", "Bob Shearer", "Yes, right now we are assuming in our numbers, we are assuming a rate of 137 and that\u2019s compared to the 130 number that we previously put out there. So, obviously, that\u2019s improved a bit and helping us a bit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan.", "Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan", "", "First of all, on CapEx, it looks like CapEx was down to about $20 million this quarter versus 35 last year Q2. Can you just talk a little bit about where the delta was on that, and what you are looking at for full year CapEx?", "Bob Shearer", "", "Yes, most of that is it has to do with stores and the timing of store openings. On a full year basis and we said earlier in the year that it was one of the areas that we would also be careful with, be cautious about. So, we expect our total CapEx on a full year basis to be maybe $10 or $15 million below last year, so right around the $110 million mark.", "Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan", "So, there is a little bit of a pickup in the second half, then?", "Bob Shearer", "", "A bit.", "Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan", "Then you spoke a few minutes ago in response to a question about advertising and maintaining advertising. Is it basically the intention to maintain advertising as a percent of sales, or to maintain it on an absolute dollar basis?", "Bob Shearer", "Mostly on a percent of sales, and we will probably be down about 50 basis points when the year end. So our advertising expense as a percent of sales has been running up over the last several years and we\u2019ll just back off a bit from that, but again, only maybe a 50 basis points reduction and, yes, that is as a percent of revenues.", "Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan", "Then, Bob do you have the pension expense for the quarter in actual dollars?", "Bob Shearer", "", "It\u2019 spread pretty evenly. So, the $90 million increase that we talked about earlier in the year is pretty well spread evenly throughout the quarter. What happens is, only because of the lower revenue, it has a bit more of an impact in our overall SG&A relationships.", "Jeff Mintz - Wedbush Morgan", "All right, but it\u2019s about a quarter of the $90 million?", "Bob Shearer", "Year-over-year, that\u2019s right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robbie Owens - Bank of America.", "Robbie Owens - Bank of America", "The first question I might have missed the Vans, if I may have this wrong, and Eric, I guess maybe it\u2019s a question for you, but I think Vans, if I recall, was flat in the first quarter or flattish in the first quarter, and then grew 14%. Was it mostly same store sales at your stores that drove that or did you see a pickup in orders from accounts or did you actually open a pretty good sized new account?", "That\u2019s one question. The second question is on the European jeanswear business. I know business is tough in Europe, but do you have a sense of whether there are any market share competitive issues for Lee and Wrangler over there? I\u2019ll just stop at those two.", "Eric Wiseman", "I\u2019m looking for the Vans number here for the first quarter. I will tell you that the performance of the Vans brand has been balanced, meaning that we have growth in comp stores. We also have been opening a fair number of new Vans stores and our wholesale business has been growing. ", "So, it has been a brand that\u2019s working for us and it grew in the quarter in Europe as well, and we launched it in China, they were small this year. So, I can\u2019t think of top of my head replace, where we have Vans declining at all.", "Bob Shearer", "Robbie, to your first quarter point, yes it was down. It was down a small amount, a small percentage in the first quarter. That was driven on the international side, but we\u2019re happy to report on the international side. We\u2019re really seeing some strength in that business now and it\u2019s much improved in the second quarter. So, as a result of the international piece, the U.S. was up in the first quarter. The second quarter was strong overall, U.S. as well as the international side.", "Robbie Owens - Bank of America", "I\u2019m just more to maybe understand just generally what\u2019s going on internationally? What drove that swing in Vans on the international side?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "As Eric mentioned before, we had a strong result in Asia. That was one piece. We show a stabilization of a relatively weaker Q1 also in the European businesses.", "Robbie Owens - Bank of America", "Then my second question on the jeanswear business in Europe and competition in market share?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, as you know I would say we are on track in our repositioning effort of Lee and Wrangler. That\u2019s going on as we had planned. Especially in Wrangler, we saw good results. We actually won last month the Grand Prix Awards income for the best advertising campaign. In Wrangler, we\u2019re very confident that we see good momentum. We are getting into distribution, where we have not been before. So Wrangler, I would say, is ahead of our repositioning plan, while Lee we are on plan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paula Torch - Needham & Company.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company", "I actually have a couple of questions on the contemporary business. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the 7 For All Mankind businesses in terms of the product. More specifically, maybe talk about what is the most popular fits or styles, if they are the same in the U.S. as they are in Europe; and if you can maybe talk also about the price points, maybe what price point is your sweet spot for Seven, has that changed significantly and does that vary between distribution channel? Thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "I will try to address some of your questions. I\u2019m afraid, I don\u2019t have all the information that you\u2019re requesting. The product line for 7 for All Mankind is largely a global product line. So there is consistency in the style in how we work the brand around the globe. It\u2019s not 100% true, but largely true.", "The next comment I would make is about your question about exact fits and stylings that are working well for us now. I\u2019m afraid, I can\u2019t answer that. I just don\u2019t know that at the brand level for all of our brands. I will comment that there has been a reduction in the AUR, is the only way I know to think about it, of the prices where consumers are buying many of our brands, including 7 for all Mankind.", "In this environment, consumers are spending their dollars a little more cautiously. So we\u2019re selling more jeans today in the $150 to $189 price point as a percentage of our total than we were last year, and less in the $200 to $300 price point. There\u2019s been a slight down. Fortunately, people are, our stores that we\u2019re opening are working for us and that\u2019s proven out to be a good investment and we intend to continue to invest in those stores. I think that\u2019s about everything I know.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company", "Okay and just maybe to follow up on that, what percentage of maybe the Seven business is. I would assume that it\u2019s mostly concentrated in that $150 to $189 as a percentage of your total sales, right? In terms of, I guess, SKU count? Would that be fair, or\u2026?", "Eric Wiseman", "I can\u2019t accurately answer that question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Just a couple of questions here, I guess. First just on the comp, for your company-owned stores, if you could give me the overall comp number for that second quarter that would be helpful. In the first quarter, I think it was down mid-single. I think your guidance for the year, you\u2019re talking about mid-single digit decline. I was wondering if you have any color about the second quarter, how that performed?", "Eric Wiseman", "Let me check that. I think its very mid singles.", "Bob Shearer", "It\u2019s very similar. It actually improved a bit from the first quarter.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. So I think you had mentioned that you saw, obviously Vans. I think, come positively you said and then, I think you said The North Face if I\u2019m not mistaken come positively as well and you saw improving trends in aggregate as you went through the quarter?", "Bob Shearer", "", "Yes, actually, I don\u2019t think we said that. We don\u2019t generally provide comps by a brand basis. We did point out the Vans piece as being positive. We really didn\u2019t talk about any others.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Okay, but in terms of the year, you are still looking for a mid single-digit decline overall for your direct-to-consumer businesses?", "Bob Shearer", "", "We are.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "Then just switching gears for a second, on the North Face, first quarter constant currency you are up 14%. You are up 2% here in the second quarter. I know second quarter is not a big quarter for you, obviously; but in the context of this, you went into the second quarter, your backlogs were up, I believe, double-digits for The North Face business. Is that primarily a level of shipments just still for the third quarter, or did you see anything going on in terms of the timing of shipments?", "Bob Shearer", "", "I\u2019m not sure I fully got the question. We are not seeing any significant changes in terms of timing within the North Face business and I would also remind you that the retail, especially in the second half of the year I\u2019m not sure if this is what you are driving at or not but does it have a significant impact, as it does in a number of our brands. So, the second half we do expect what I did say was we expected the comparisons to be stronger in the second half and the seasonality of retail has something to do with that, obviously.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "", "I guess the last question I have here is for either Karl or Aidan. Just if I caught you correctly, you said the Asia pacific business is a $300 billion business, and you see overtime it could be a $1 billion business? Could you maybe you put some parameters about when that is maybe I missed that, just a point of clarification.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "We expect the business to continue at a growth rate of around 30%. I think we can use that as a benchmark in terms of our expectations as we look out. At an annual rate of 30%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Maggie Gillian - Gillian & Company.", "Maggie Gillian - Gillian & Company", "Could you talk a little bit about the go forward strategy for Nautica? It seems to be indefinite still.", "Eric Wiseman", "No, it\u2019s not indefinite at all and we are committed to the department store channel. We spent a lot of effort this year improving the product styling of our product, and we think we were successful with that. We are investing more in our shop-in-shops, particularly with Macy\u2019s; and we have seen the change this year has been consumer shifts in all brands towards more value pricing.", "So, we\u2019ve had to react to that Maggie, as has everyone else. That was not in our playbook when we started the year, but it certainly has become part of our playbook as the year has unfolded. We\u2019ve reacted to that by designing into those more value price points for the time being, whether that\u2019s the most relevant place for all these brands to be.", "Maggie Gillian - Gillian & Company", "Somewhat related question, but more general one, could you talk a little bit about the performance of your outlet stores versus your regular specialty stores?", "Eric Wiseman", "Is then an across VF question?", "Maggie Gillian - Gillian & Company", "Yes, pretty much.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. I think like many, our outlet stores are performing consistently well. It gets back to the same value play, Maggie. People are looking for value, when they\u2019re shopping in the outlet centers and our outlet stores are doing pretty well. Less so than our more premium priced stores where it\u2019s a struggle selling, everybody is struggling at that price effect.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I\u2019m hoping you can talk about your comments about stabilization in the European jeanswear business. That\u2019s a very abrupt change and telling from your comments following Q1. Can you put a little more color on that, please?", "Eric Wiseman", "Let me just make a couple of comments about that, Jim. Then I\u2019ll ask Karl Heinz to comment as well. I talked about the Eastern European business in my commentary and we do need to be a little bit careful with that. We anticipated a good year in Eastern Europe. Even in a tough environment, our business has been very good within Eastern Europe and we expected that to be an area that was going to be a pretty strong business for us.", "So, when we had to pull that down it was versus our plans. As we talked about at the end of the first quarter, we had to pull it down versus our plan. So, what we said now was that it has stabilized somewhat and it\u2019s acting more like in Eastern Europe, it\u2019s acting more like the rest of Europe, which is a good thing. I think the important point there is that it\u2019s not deteriorating, not continuing to slide.", "So again, that\u2019s we wanted to make that point. That we had a number of questions on that related to, \u201cCould it get worse? Is it going to continue to go down?\u201d So it hasn\u2019t, which is the good news, but it\u2019s still a challenge for us versus our original plans and it\u2019s still down from what we originally planned. Anything else, Karl?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "No, I think Bob said at of all. There\u2019s not too much to add here on this.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Glick - Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "Just a follow-up on the same topic, we\u2019ve talked a lot about your jeans business in Eastern Europe and not as much about Western Europe, which obvious is a bigger market and your business is really distorted by that concentration of jeans in Eastern Europe. ", "Can you give a better sense of what\u2019s happen across your brands and what the tone of business is in Western Europe, is it which consider that region as also having stabilized has it gotten worse as the year has progressed has it gotten better? Any kind of color or some specifics on constant currency trends in Western Europe and I know it\u2019s hard to generalize every market is different but if appreciate some color on that.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "As you mentioned, it\u2019s hard to generalize; but the common point is what we can say, it\u2019s certainly a tough environment at the moment. It\u2019s a growing market and the challenges we see are all there. I think that the change to Q1 is that we have stabilized this negative growth and we don\u2019t expect further deterioration. That\u2019s the big change compared to a couple of months ago.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "In Western Europe, as well as Eastern Europe?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "In Western Europe as well, yes.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "Okay, and any is Spain still the toughest market there and how are things and if you could give a little bit of commentary on UK, France and Germany?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "Yes, as we know the economy in Spain is probably amongst the most challenging in Europe, so that\u2019s reflected in general in our businesses not only in jeans, but certainly also in jeans. We have some issues not only we have, their certain pressure on key dealers in Germany, you probably have heard about, which I went into kind of Chapter 11 European version of Chapter 11. So there are certainly challenges. The European economy is not immune from this major pressure we have. We see actually work rate.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "So it\u2019s fair to say in Western Europe, then just to wrap it up -- that the trends have been consistent Q1 to Q2, but fell off from Q4?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "I didn\u2019t get the last question. Did you say?", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "", "Just I wanted just to confirm that Q1 and Q2 trends in Western Europe are fairly similar, which represent a big fall off from obviously Q4 trends?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "Yes, we could say so.", "Operator", "We have no more questions at this time.", "", "Eric Wiseman", "Okay. Thank you all for joining us on the call and for your interest in V.F. We\u2019ve come through our most difficult quarter of the year. We\u2019ve gained share in our biggest brands. We are positioned for the second half, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks.", "", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s call.

Baird", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", " ", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the VF Corporation third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Please be aware that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana of ICR.  Please go ahead ma\u2019am.", "Jean Fontana - ICR", "Thank you, good afternoon, thanks for participating in VF Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2009 conference call.  By now you should have received today\u2019s earnings press release.  If not, please call 203-682-8200, and we will send you a copy immediately following the call.  ", "Coaching the call this afternoon is Mr. Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF.  Before we begin we would like to remind participants certain statements included in today\u2019s remarks in the Q&A session may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  ", "Forward looking statements are not guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations, or financial conditions of the Company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the Company in the SEC.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you Jean and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today.  Our third quarter results clearly signal that the worst effects of the recession may be behind us.  And they tell us that even during incredibly difficult conditions, VF\u2019s diversified business model and operating discipline can enable performance that is superior to many companies both within and outside our industry.", "For example, excluding foreign currency effects, our revenues were down only 3%.  And excluding the dual impacts of pension expense and currency in this year\u2019s quarter, as well as the $0.07 in unusual items in last year\u2019s quarter, on an apples-to-apples basis, our earnings per share would actually have been up 4% from last year\u2019s third quarter. I think that speaks volumes about our ability to leverage the strength of our brands, while remaining laser focused on managing costs and maintaining liquidity.  ", "To reiterate the high points of the quarter: two of our powerhouse brands, The North Face and Vans, continue to show very good momentum in the face of what is arguably the worst period of consumer spending in recent history. In this momentum is the result of creative and disciplined brand management and prudent investment, not short term changes in pricing or distribution.", "Two of our other powerhouse brands, Wrangler and Lee, are also continuing to perform well here in the US.  Wrangler continues to be an important mainstay for our big mass market in western specialty store customers, who rely on the brand\u2019s reputation, quality, and innovation to drive traffic and repeat purchases. We play the similar role with its mid-tier customers, where it continues to outperform its competitors with consumer driven product innovation.", "It is no secret that Nautica has not performed up to our expectations during the past couple of years, and you have rightly questioned the prospects and the timing of a turnaround.  So we are also very pleased that our sportswear operating margins rose nearly 400 basis points in the quarter to 15.8%, driven by higher margins in our Nautica wholesale business.", "Revenue comparisons also improved in the quarter, that we noted we continued to expect mid single-digit declines for the second half of the year in total. We do not expect much near term improvement in overall retail conditions.  But we do believe our work to improve Nautica\u2019s products, brand positioning, and profitably have significantly strengthened the brand\u2019s foundation.  ", "Our retail revenues continued to rise in the quarter, as we continued to selectively add new stores across our strongest brand concepts.  We remain very disciplined in our approach to new store openings, choosing to expand only those concepts that would drive both top and bottom line growth. ", "And last, our financial position remains extremely strong.  We are beating our inventory reduction targets.  We will end the year with a healthy cash balance.  And we are raising our projection for cash flow from operations to near record levels.", "But to be sure, challenges remain.  Our European jeans business remains under pressure.  While conditions in Europe have stabilized, the market for higher-end jeans like Lee and Wrangler remains difficult, as it does here. Similarly, our contemporary brands business in the US continues to feel the effect of very weak conditions in upper tier department and specialty stores.", "However, our 7 for All Mankind revenues are likely to be only slightly below prior year levels, and that includes a planned double-digit decrease in their off price business and the brand should continue to enjoy mid-teen operating margins this year.", "The growth opportunities we identified at the time we purchased the brand, international expansion, retail-store growth, and product line extensions remain intact, and we continue to see excellent long term potential for the brand.", "Our image wear business is in a tough spot.  Its uniform business is very sensitive to employment conditions and until those improve, this business is likely to remain challenging. But the team there deserves much credit for keeping customer relationships strong, and for aggressively managing costs that have kept the operating margins of that business at healthy double-digit levels.  So we have excellent leverage in place when conditions do improve.", "We are looking forward to ending 2009 on a solid note, with both revenue comparisons and double digit growth in fourth quarter earnings per share. For the year, we strengthened our guidance on both the top and bottom lines.  We now anticipate that revenues will be down about 6%, including a 2% currency impact and we are establishing a new range for earnings per share of $4.80 to $5.00, $4.85 to $5.00, which is at the high end of our prior guidance.", "One other area I would like to touch on before turning the call over to Bob.  In the last several weeks, there has been a tremendous amount of buzz about the potential for reorders and replenishment, given leaner inventories of retail and improving comp store comparisons. ", "It is true that inventories at retail are down a lot from prior year levels.  It is also true that comp store comparisons, while still negative, are becoming less bad. Both of those factors bode well for stronger retail industry margins near term. However, we are going to continue to adopt a cautious approach to planning our business, as we believe that consumer spending will remain challenged as unemployment continues to rise, credit remains tight, and savings rates remain above historic levels.", "We do not believe that global economy is out of the woods, just yet.  Despite these challenges, I have great confidence that we have the right strategies in place to emerge from these very difficult times, stronger than ever.  We have great brands with lots of runway for growth still ahead.  Our profitability is strong, with operating margins at double digit levels, and our balance sheet is in great shape.  ", "Let us hear more on the quarter now from Bob Shearer.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I am going to start with revenues, which were down by 5% or 3% in constant dollars.  That is an improvement over the declines reported in both the first and second quarters of this year.  ", "Now moving down the P&L, we are pleased to report another quarter of strong gross margins.  In fact, at 44.3%, gross margins are only slightly below the record level of 44.4% that we achieved in last year\u2019s third quarter. This continued strength in gross margins can be attributed to expanding gross margins in our outdoor and action sports and US jeans businesses, as well as a positive impact of our growing full priced retail business with its higher margins. In fact, we expect this momentum in gross margins to continue into the fourth quarter, when our margin percentage should exceed 45%.", "Once again, our retail growth will play a role in this improvement, but we also expect to see expanded margins across many of our businesses across the globe, in the quarter, reflecting operating efficiencies and the strength of our brands.", "SG&A as a percent of revenues rose 60 basis points, and that includes the impact of our higher pension expense, which represented an increase of 100 basis points to the quarter. Retail growth, with its higher SG&A relationships, also increased the overall expense ratio to revenues, while our cost management efforts reduced the percentage. Regarding the fourth quarter, the SG&A relationship to revenues will remain relatively flat, to up slightly from the prior year period.  For the quarter, the SG&A percent will be helped or lowered, by the absence of the restructuring charge in Q4 2008 and the related benefits from those actions. However, the quarter will also reflect increases from higher pension expense and growth in our retail business.  ", "Now our lower tax rate in the quarter reflects a reduction in our anticipated annual effective tax rate.  From last quarter\u2019s call, we said we had expected of about 27% for the year. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to approximate 26%.  We expect that our lower tax rate for 2009 will be sustainable going forward. ", "That brings us to earnings per share, which were $1.94 in the quarter.  Earnings per share in the quarter included a combined $0.17 per share impact from pension and currency. In addition, as we disclosed last year, the prior periods\u2019 quarter included a net $0.07 benefit from unusual items, primarily one-time tax benefits and restructuring. So, on a more comparable basis for excluding these items, earnings per share would have increased by 4% in the quarter.", "Now taking a quick look at our coalition results, and I will start with Outdoor and Action Sports.  Revenues were about flat, with those of the prior year\u2019s quarter but up 3% in constant dollars, driven by strong growth in our North Face and Vans brands.  ", "Our direct to consumer business continues to be an important growth driver for us with revenues up 17% overall and double digit growth in our North Face, Vans, and Napapijri brands. We were especially pleased to report record operating income and margins for the coalition in the quarter.  It is a real achievement by our Outdoor and Action Sports teams, especially given the challenging environment. And we expect this strength to continue in the fourth quarter as well, with even higher revenue growth and continued operating margin expansion in the quarter versus prior year levels.", "Now in terms of our jeans wear business, as anticipated, revenue comparisons improved in the third quarter versus the second.  On a constant currency basis, revenues were down 7% in the third quarter compared with the 12% decline in the second quarter. The improvement is especially evident in our domestic business which was down 6% in the third quarter, compared with the decline of 12% in the second quarter.", "In the US, our Lee brand continues to gain share.  With revenues down only slightly, we are by about 1%.  We are also pleased that our Wrangler brand remains in a very strong position in the mass market, with enhanced brand signage now in place with our largest mass market customer. Our overall mass market revenue comparisons, however, continue to be hurt by the loss of certain non-core Riders brand programs, as we discussed in the second quarter. But just as we indicated then, our core Riders Missy business continues to gain share.  ", "Now as Erick noted, our European jeans business continues to be challenging due to weak market conditions that seem to be impacting most players in the jeans wear sector. In fact, industry reports indicate that total European retail sales fell for 16 consecutive months in September, while unemployment continues to rise. Our international jeans wear revenues declined 10% in constant dollars in the quarter.  With the clients in our European business partially offset by continued strong growth in Asia, where our jeans wear revenues rose 17%.", "Now despite the revenue declines in our jeans wear businesses, our Global Jeans Wear Organization has done a great job of maintaining operating margins at historically strong levels. We should see this again in the fourth quarter with margins nearly double those of the prior year\u2019s quarter.  ", "Expanding gross margins, in our US jeans businesses, in both the third and fourth quarters, and for our international businesses in the fourth quarter, are playing an important role in our overall strength in jeans wear profitability. Now to be sure, operating margins last year were impacted by charges related to cost reduction actions.  But on an apples-to-apples basis, that is taking out the impact of the charges, our jeans wear operating margins will still reflect a healthy increase driven by the stronger gross margin comparisons. ", "And no doubt, you have all noted the big improvement in our sportswear coalition results this quarter.  Sportswear revenues rose 4% in the quarter with a 52% increase in operating income, and operating margins reaching nearly 16%.", "Now we did note that the revenue increase was helped by a shift in the timing of our product shipments but we are on track to achieve overall better comparisons in the second half compared with the first and operating margins should remain at double digit levels in the fourth quarter. ", "We made a lot of improvements in the operating model for our Nautica business, in particular, as reflected in our second half profit projections. I also wanted to add a comment about our Kipling US business during the quarter. We agreed to distribute Kipling handbags on an exclusively basis to Macy\u2019s Department Stores in the US, starting Spring 2010. We will roll out Kipling handbags and accessories to about 375 stores by the first quarter and expect to rollout to all doors within a year\u2019s time. ", "Turning now to our contemporary brands business, revenues rose again this quarter with the increase due to this year\u2019s acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands, it should be no surprise that given conditions and opportunities in department and specialty stores our 7 For All Mankind brand revenues declined in the quarter. But as we pointed out in the release, despite the challenges presented by this environment, our 7 for All Mankind global teams will achieve strong double digit operating margins for the year, reflecting the overall strength of this brand and its potential moving forward. The bright spots for the brand in this environment were in our direct to customers and Asia businesses both of which experienced strong growth in the quarter. Globally, year to date, we have opened 13 retail stores and expect a total of 20 new store openings for the year in total. ", "In the release, we stated that we expect much stronger revenue on operating margin comparisons. In the fourth quarter, for our contemporary brands coalition as whole, revenues for our 7 for All Mankind brand should actually be up in the quarter as we benefit from new store openings and continued growth internationally. For the coalition overall, we anticipate the returns of double digit operating margins in the fourth quarter. ", "Finally, a few words on our image wear business. Story here remains pretty much as it has in the past couple of quarters, high and rising unemployment levels affecting our uniform business while poor attendance at major leagues sporting events and the highly discretionary nature of sports-related apparel products has dampened sales of our licensed team apparel products.", "Eric pointed out on his opening that we have maintained double digit margins in our image or uniform business despite the challenged top line. That means that when conditions improve, our cost structure should provide good leverage for profitability improvements. For the fourth quarter, coalition operating margin should be relatively stable, a significant improvement from prior quarter comparisons this year. ", "Our press release touched on our retailing international performance and I have a couple of comments here. On the international side first, revenues decline on a constant currency basis with a decline of 6% in our European business which accounted for 70% of total international revenues in the quarter. Partially offsetting that was an increase of 32% in our Asian business which accounted for about 12% of total international revenues in the third quarter. ", "In the fourth quarter, we do expect to see an increase in our international revenues on both the constant currency and reported basis. We see continued momentum in our business in Asia with a revenue increase comparable to that which we achieved in the third quarter.", "In terms of our retail business, our direct-to-consumer revenues rose 6% in the quarter with 23 new stores opened in the period, primarily, full priced formats. We now expect to open over 80 stores this year. It is a bit more than previously planned. As Eric noted, we are being selective in our store openings. We are investing on those concepts that provide strong financial returns and strengthen our brands\u2019 equity with consumers. ", "Our focus on inventory management is really paying off for this year. Inventories were down 13% in the quarter and are now expected to be down by the same amount over year-end 2008 levels. This has contributed to even stronger than anticipated cash flow from operations. You probably saw that we raised our cash flow guidance between now, I think that could approach $800 million, very close to our prior record of $834 million achieved in 2007. ", "I also should point out that during the quarter we put our strong cash flow to work, purchasing 750,000 shares of VF stock. We expect the purchase of similar amount in the fourth quarter as well bringing the total to 1.5 million shares for the year. ", "I think Eric covered our revised guidance pretty well. But just to reiterate, full year revenue should decline by about 6% versus our prior guidance of 5% to 7% decline. Foreign currency rates will account for 2% of the decline. Full year earnings per share expected to come in between $4.85 and $5, which are at the higher end of our previous range of $4.70 and $5. We have given ourselves $0.15 worth of flexibility for the fourth quarter, even if there remains much uncertainty regarding consumer spending for the upcoming important holiday season. In this environment, we believe in staying on the side of caution.  ", "With that, we will take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instruction) Our first question is from Robert Drbul from Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul \u2014 Barclays Capital", "Couple of questions, first on the Nautica business, can you give us an update on the year-to-date, why you guys have done well or where your shortfalls and sort of. And as you think about the business for next year for the Nautica business, any ideas in terms of both top line and bottom line are higher for next year as well. And then on the 7 business, can you give us a dollar numbers around the off price business and sort of the negative impact that has had on the business being negative right now or down sales and percentage of sales of 2009 versus 2008 sort of how to think about that business?", "Eric Wiseman", "I will start with the Nautica comment and talk about what changed this year. You might remember Bob, going back on the first part of this year; we were redoing the Nautica business coming into 2009 with updated products that were more expensive in price point, better built. They were worth more money but not in this environment and that really affected the first half of this year but we took our average price points up or we tried to, which was the right thing to do going into, what we did not know is going to be a recession. The change for the back half of the year has been, we have adopted more value price points and more value products and that is working much better for us as you might imagine in this environment. I cannot comment specifically on 2010 at this point, but we will do that in February when we cover 2010. On the 7-For-All-Mankind question, I do not know if we have that information available.", "Robert K. Shearer ", "It is not specific dollars Bob, but what I can tell you is that the reduction in the off-price channel is about 15% from the prior year, I know you are looking for specific numbers. But it has impacted our year overall and we think it is the absolutely right thing to do for the brand.", "Robert Drbul \u2014 Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then is there a longer-term, more philosophical questions in terms of looking at the numbers, I guess going forward in the 2010 without talking specifically to 2010 guidance? Eric when you look at the various puts-and-takes of the business, pensions versus foreign exchange and the benefit of not having the $0.30 issue in the fourth quarter of this year. When you plan forward in the next few years, how should we think about it from core operations perspective in terms of long-term VF targets versus the pension or foreign exchange issues that you had as you look forward to 2010? How should we think about that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Bob, I am not sure about what you are looking for. In terms of FX, as we look forward in the early part of next year assuming that especially euro-versus-dollar holds where it is, there could be some impact there or some benefit because as you know, our first quarter and our third quarter are by far our largest international quarters. So it could help the first quarter somewhat. In the third quarter right now we have to say that not a big impact, one way or the other but those are clearly the two largest quarters where we may see some impact next year, and what else, so in terms of other factors, what else is it that you are looking for?", "Robert Drbul \u2014 Barclays Capital", "So I guess the question that I am looking at is when we consider our numbers for 2010 and you look at what you have reported thus far for 2009, let us say there is about $0.70 of numbers, $0.70 of earnings impact from this year. Is it fair to look at the business and say long term VF is at 8%, targeted 8% to 10% grower and we could get the core operations of 8% plus getting back some of the pension hits or the foreign exchanges that we had this year?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, I will comment on 2010 related to the pension because it has obviously been a factor in this year\u2019s numbers. As we look forward, if the market held where it is today, and as we have explained in the past, the increase in pension expenses worth this year obviously driven by the value of the assets in our plan. And right now, if the market stays where it is right now, that would reduce our overall expense next year by something like $15 or $20 million. So that would be a favorable impact for us as we look at next year just like the other currency piece that we just talked about.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Duffy from Thomas Weisel Partners Group", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Group", "You speak to the same store performance of your own stores as you progress through third quarter and what kind of expectation for comp share built-into the fourth quarter outlook?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well as you know Jim we do not provide specific comp store data we have and as we look into the next quarter clearly we are expecting improvements. We are beginning to see that in our stores. So overall, the one business, our largest business in terms of retail which represents about a third of the number of stores that we have from the retail standpoint in the quarter, showed comp stores increases in the mid, single digit, so we are really pleased with that. Overall for VF the comps were flat to down just slightly. Then in the fourth quarter we do expect to see some improvements from that.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Group", "And where are the comparisons that we are going against in the fourth quarter from last year? They were positive, correct, if I remember?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes by just a small amount Jim, just a few percentage point.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Group", "Okay, and then there is general expectation in the retail channel that demand could exceed supply of inventory on hand at retail? Could you guys speak to your opportunity to chase business? Which of the business plan like jeans, where are you may be able to capitalize on some of that access demand and which are some of the ones where the  lead times are longer, and if the inventories are gone, there is no business to done?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Jim I know you appreciate how complicated or how complex VF is, and so there is not an easy answer to that question but you are right, our jeans were our business, it is one category where we have lots of capacity in this hemisphere and its quick turn capacity. We have raw materials, held-on consignments, we could go from purchase order to the DC in 20 days for the products that we make here, the other end of that, of course, is long lead time, equipment, sleeping bags and tents that we make in Asia, where we could not react if there was an uptick between now and Christmas. But we do have a meaningful part of our business here in this hemisphere where we are in a position to react. ", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Group", "Eric is there any other categories where you wished you had more inventories?", "Eric Wiseman", "Jim our approach this whole year has been that we are going to take inventory out and chase sales, if we are blessed with the opportunity to chase sales. So it looks like that opportunity maybe coming through, and we will be thankful to have it but I am glad that we did not build excess inventory hoping that demand will get better.", "Operator", "The next question from Kate McShane from Citi Investment Research", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research", "Could you just help us understand Bob\u2019s comment at the end, addresses a little bit but I wonder if you could go into a little bit more specific about, why is there no increase at the high-end of your guidance today. And the reason I ask is just sound like things are getting much better both on the currency front and inventory since sequentially your inventory is so much better than last quarter and the first quarter. So could you just explain what has gotten so much better from the low-end of your guidance or what scenario disappeared and why isn\u2019t there that confidence to raise that guidance from the higher end today?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well Kate, relative to the overall range, we have eliminated some of the uncertainties that we had, that is why we gave ourselves a fair amount of flexibility in $4.70 to $5.00 and after having other quarter behind us maybe a little bit better look. At the fourth quarter, we obviously felt better about going to the higher end of the range. We just, as we look at the holiday season as I have said, we just mentioned it in my final comment, there is still some fair level of uncertainty relative to overall consumer spending, unemployment levels, all of those factors, so we are trying to take a cautious approach and we just think that the prudent thing to do in this environment. ", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Well Kate, we are well-positioned in terms of overall profitability. As Eric said we are in a position we believe that we will respond a little faster than most in terms of our ability to catch up or chase business and we will be very, very happy to do that if we have the opportunity to do it and that obviously would be great for us in the quarter but it is just not, not planning that way.", "Eric Wiseman", "Well Kate, it is true that we saw like many, an improvement in consumer spending during the back-to-school period and that carried over into the early part of October. But all the information that we have on the economy suggested that there is more unemployment to come. It suggests that the credit problems are severe and not fully recognized? How that shows up in holiday spending? I do not know, but it does lead us to say we are not ignoring those hard economic facts and they are putting us in the position where we are being a little bit cautious about it.", "Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research", "That is great and then I wondered if you could just comment or give some commentary around the North Face and the backlogs that you have seen from the North Face for spring?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, the spring order positions are stronger in the mid, single-digit area. And that is a global number maybe even, yes maybe a little stronger on the international side.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad from Credit Suisse", "Omar Saad - Credit Suisse", "Wanted to ask a follow-up question on the SG&A operating expense line, I mean you guys did a great job on the gross margin line this quarter, pretty healthy gross margin. I know your supply chain is one of the most sophisticated and efficient out there. It is a little bit of surprising in the expense number by looking at what you tracked down in the first half. Your year-over-year spending was down, something in the order of $50 million, $60 million, $70 million whereas in the third quarter it looks like your spending was maybe down a little bit a few million dollars. Is there something structurally different about the third quarter or is there some new expenses coming on and even focus on expenses for the whole year. Given some of the commentary about the over arching environment, it is a little bit of a surprise to see spending not a little bit tighter in the quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "No Omar, I look at it obviously in terms of the ratios to revenues and couple of factors obviously that the pension, which I know you are very well aware of, is represented about a 100-basis point so that is moving the ratio up. The retail business as well again we expect to see a very strong gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter and really see the retail investments pay off but the retail business and the gross in our retail business is pushing the SG&A up there as well. So as we look at the fourth quarter, as I indicated in my comments, we are anticipating a very strong gross margin growth in the fourth quarter, some of that is due to retail, some of that due to a number of other factors in terms of inventory controls and that kind of thing. But retail is a factor so we have got pension, we have got the retail piece, we have the overall cost management efforts as well, going the other way in the third quarter so we net out to a bit off.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "But nothing, there is nothing specific", "Eric Wiseman", "No there is nothing that really, really stands out in the quarter.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Maybe in the marketing, advertising front that you are still maintaining that kind of high-level of investments that you have in the past?", "Eric Wiseman", "We are and that is the point. In terms of the advertising expense, as a percent of revenue we were down 50 or 60 basis points but still spending at a fairly high level, particularly as on a ratio to revenue.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, alright. I also want to talk about the sales, the philosophy of sales versus inventory. The inventory keeps getting cleaner and cleaner for you guys, do you feel like, I mean, it seems to me at some point you cannot grow sales without inventory. Is anybody out there who were willing to take a little bit more of risk on inventory and it did not sound like you guys has some ability to chase the course but philosophically, it is hard to grow sales without inventory. I wanted to see how you feel about that?", "Eric Wiseman", "We just want to be in a position to react to that. If you look at our inventory, and turn to our model we have around a 100 days of inventory, Bob will probably have the confirmation of that but that is about the number. We could supply three months of incremental sales without making another piece of product. We think that puts us in a reasonable position to chase. We are going to react to that pretty quickly, fortunately our supply chain engine, as you commented on, is well-developed and we are in the position to react very quickly if we need to.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then last question. Cold weather, I mean it has been freezing the last few weeks, you have been hearing things about undersupply of coats, jackets anything you are seeing in the North Face business? Or any other businesses than can corroborate that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, the cold weather always helps the North Face business and this year is no exception.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Tracy with FBR Capital Markets", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets", "Actually I just wanted to touch on pricing if I could, obviously a trend towards moving lower price point value on new products. Could you talk a little bit about which brands, or coalitions are best positioned to partly capitalize on? On that and pick up incremental volume and then which might be sort of negatively impacted from a margin perspective?", "Eric Wiseman", "Complicated question Eric. All of our brands have reacted to this economic environment by introducing value prices, valued products to their consumer base. In some cases that meant a reduction in prices, in some cases we are just seeing the velocity in the brand at a slightly lower price point that it was last year bringing us to an effectively lower AUR. Not necessarily lower margin but a lower AUR in the products that we are selling. So we can maintain our gross margin rate, the challenge becomes in maintaining the top line if your AUR is down which we are seeing. I do not think that we have a brand that is unable to react to that, they just react to it differently in a different orders of magnitude that our mid-tier and mass businesses have less of a need to react to that, because in this environment there has been more shopping in these channels.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, even though I mentioned that there would be some, be it North Face or even 7 For-all-Mankind, incremental volume play that you could pick up by maybe squeezing out some of those lesser brands within a given channel, it may drive some of the  volumes up there?", "Eric Wiseman", "Overtime throughout this recession, we have lost retail customers through this recession. And there are competitors who are weak; more of our brands are strong. And we do think we are taking share in many of our brands in many product categories.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, fair enough. And then just in the retail quick, the incremental doors that you are now looking to this year, could you and Bob break out what the difference is, full price versus outlets?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Yes, it is about 80% full price. Though it is clearly our expansion in retail right now is clearly driven by full price stores. The outlets, any outlet store openings are only driven by our capacity to move excess products. So the balance, I guess I would say the imbalance, in terms of our overall store count is clearly getting more and more heavily weighted towards the full price stores.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay and then geographically speaking, domestic versus international?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Yes, it is still by far because of the retail format and also because of the partnership arrangements that we have outside of the US. The US continues to comprise a much a higher percentage, they have this year in terms of new store openings and in terms of total store count and still represents something like 75% or a little bit higher of our total stores.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sean Martin from Piper Jaffray", "Sean Martin - Piper Jaffray ", "First on the jeans wear business, obviously Asia was up 17%, US seems to be improving, but Europe seems still to be a weak spot, can you give us any flavor on which particular countries or areas are seeing the impact in Europe", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, my first comment would be that in general, the European jeans market is tough; it is not something that is unique to VF, it is a market-wide challenge in Europe. Our model in Europe is a little different than some of our competitors; we invested heavily for growth in Eastern Europe in the last several years and got that growth. We built a nice business there. That business has been challenge by difficulty in the economies and the collapse of currencies, which has resulted in the reported revenue decline that is disproportionate for us. ", "So while the market in total is tough, the way our business model was constructed overtime was we have a disproportionate share in the market that got tough. That has shown up in our numbers.", "Sean Martin - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, fair enough. In terms of the order bulk for next year, I think you talked about the North Face obviously being up mid, single-digit globally. Last year you mentioned that you were seeing a little bit of caution for this spring order book. Can you talk about, in relative terms, how you are feeling this year versus last year, heritage brand versus lifestyle, or domestic versus international orders?", "Eric Wiseman", "We do not have the same visibility as we do in our outdoor business relative to those positions as you know. A lot of our jeans business for example you mentioned that a more traditional businesses or gone on a replenishment basis. So a very different business models so we talked about the outdoor business because we can and we know there are positions elsewhere we really do not have a lot of good data.", "Sean Martin - Piper Jaffray ", "And lastly, you are building up obviously a significant amount of cash in the balance sheet, anything on the acquisition front that you guys are looking at right now?", "Eric Wiseman", "Cannot comment specifically but I can tell you we are busy and active. I would like to make some acquisitions but do not have anything we can talk about now.", "Sean Martin - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay and then last question on, you recently announced a retail license brand segment, any thoughts on moving one of your wholesale brand to a licensing model or has there been any work on that front that has been completed yet that you are willing to share?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, we hired a leader to lead that effort here, and he is in his first 90 days of his assignment and we are looking at how we could acquire brands to satisfy that needs. Are there brands that are active in our portfolio, or are there brands that are no longer active in our portfolio? How do we bring that to market and make sure that as we work with our large core of customers we add that part of the mix that we do with them. So we are going down that path and nothing to report quite yet, it is still early days.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS Investment Bank", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Couple of questions on the gross margin comments made on the fourth quarter you said you were looking for 45 which is probably the highest gross margin we have seen, looking back at almost any quarter and I wonder if maybe you can walk us through a bit of the puts and takes that you see driving us above levels on the past there?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Sure, I will do that Mike. Well you are right; it would be high for us. Yes, so when you look at last year, first of all point it out that the restructuring impacts we had last year had no almost impact on the gross margins. So, last year\u2019s number is clean from that stand point. We talked about retail in terms of our retail business it will move the margins up by a hundred basis points so that is part of the improvement. The rest of the improvement, again to the 45% or even a little above the 45% level, it is primarily driven by operations and I guess the things that pleased us the most are we are seeing the expansion in gross margin in our largest businesses and in my commentary I talked about that the jeans wear businesses both in the US as well as on the international side and that is very important. There were some questions earlier about European business challenge to be sure about what we do expect to see, a much better quarter in the fourth quarter and a lot of that driven by stronger gross margins.", "So, those are the kind of things that we are looking at that are particularly strong and obviously the kind of thing we are looking for in the fourth quarter. So, about a hundred basis points and the rest driven by the expansion I talked about and then just over-all improvement in the efficiencies in running our business with very clean inventories.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Just a quick follow to that, what if you maybe higher level above supply chain? I think you saw about 25% of your own manufacturing?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "That is about right.", "Eric Wiseman", "Mostly in jeans, I believe, is that right?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "That is right.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "And when you think about owning that process with comments we heard today, with jeans wear revenues continue to be down. It seems that you expect a relatively flat or slow snap back overall for the economy. When we think about the new normal level of purchasing retail in your markets, do you think it is that close for any kind of capacity reduction in those buys you guys owned, in your own factories?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "We do not see that in our current forecast while we do own that capacity and it is mostly organized on our jeans business. That jeans also sources a large amount of what they do, close to half of the jeans we sell are sourced. So we have a balanced approach to our total supply chain that include own capacity and source goods that are flexible.", "Operator", "For our next question is from Robbie Owens - Bank of America and Merrill Lynch ", "Robert Ohmes - Bank of America and Merrill Lynch", "I just have a quick question that maybe you can help us with? If you look across all your businesses, you look at jeans wear, in sportswear and North Face, and Vans etc. Can you just talk about what are you seeing and the consumer respond to? Are there any shifts towards lower price points? Are you seeing your key customers\u2019 focus more on entry level price point programs with you? Have you seen any shift in the relative strengths of the channels you deal with? Is your mix of business outside the D to C, skewing towards WalMart and Cole\u2019s in the moderate channel? If you just give us some color about what is going on in the world out there, that would be terrific.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. My first reaction to that is innovation. Every time we launch an innovative product, it works. Consumers are paying the fair price for it. The key thing that we working throughout our organization are to be innovative in our products and offer things that the consumers have not seen before and charge them a fair price for it.", "In some cases, in the \u201cwe\u201d brand this year, our average in our retail in the mid-tier channel is actually up, and we are taking share there with higher average in retail because we have innovative new products. Coles and JC Penny and that are really working for us.", "Second thing is value. We are seeing across our brands consumers who maybe last year spent $179 for product, maybe you are shopping in $159 price point this year. There has been some trade down to just price value but the more important piece really is the innovation piece that is why we live with that.", "In terms of channels of distribution, we are seeing the same thing at our own store that you see when you read the comp-store\u2019s that are out there and are published every month. The higher end of price spectrum in regular retail by that, I mean, Neiman Marcus and Barneys and Saks, their comps have been weaker than the comps at the mass and mid-tier, and that suggest that consumers are either shopping down or the higher end shopper is just quite out shopping for less. We are seeing that consistently across our brands and we are seeing this is in our own retail as well. Does that help you?", "Robert Ohmes - Bank of America and Merrill Lynch", "It does, so it might be tough to look at this way but just collectively the pressure on your revenues, do you think it is more unifying or do you think it is more price that sort of pressure to your global revenues? FX neutral.", "Eric Wiseman", "Our global revenues for the year, currently is going to be down 4% FX neutral, right? And quite frankly, I think we are really pleased with that. If you look at how deep this recession is and you look at the fact that last year was an all-time record revenue year for us, we come up against in all-time record revenue and only have a 4% decline in this recession. It is something I think it we pretty proud of.", "We are seeing however, a lower AUR which suggests that there is a price piece on top of the unit reduction in sales.", "Operator", "For our next question is from Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group from Susquehanna Financial Group", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group ", "Good afternoon, gentlemen. I guess first on the inventory. When the inventory is down 13% at the end of the quarter, how should we be looking at the inventory by year-end and any thoughts on how you might be planning inventory as you head in the spring 2010?", "Eric Wiseman", "First on the inventory, this is a follow-up comment. We reduced our inventory the most where they were the highest and that may seem very obvious, but the point is in terms of our ability to service the business, we had some areas where the inventories were higher than absolutely needed to be. Somewhere from newer acquisitions and we knew that was an opportunity for us all along, so we have been working those inventories down.", "And to that same point, as we go forward we think there is still some opportunity in 2010 to pull the inventories down, perhaps somewhat more, maybe not the same level that we are seeing this year. But, I can tell you we do that with a very, very close eye on our ability to service the business, and even though our inventories have been pulled down. Our service levels have never been higher.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. As you think about that moving to spring is there any particular segment of the business where there is more opportunity continue to rationalize that inventory relative to others? I mean after you have gone through 2009 and you have made those adjustments were necessary as you start to enter into 2010, are there other areas or elements for the business we can just be more efficient or just opportunity to continue to reduce the inventory piece?", "Eric Wiseman", "This is just an opportunity to reduce it over-all. Again, we are after a lot a low hanging fruit at this point in time, but always some ability to refine.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. And then Eric, when I think about Europe for a second and I know you talked about jeans wear business continue to be challenged in specific opportunities, in Eastern Europe continues there. What gives you the confidence, at least from a top line perspective, as we think about Western Europe and not just in jeans wear business but across the other businesses as well? In terms of when we can start to see some improvement, and I do not know if you can break out that decline of 6% in Euro and break it up between eastern and western or anything like  that would be helpful too.", "Eric Wiseman", "I am afraid I cannot break it out between east and west. I do not have the information in front of me. But the European economy in general is still weak like the US economy is. It is western pocket, the eastern pocket that we talked about. It is softer in Southern Europe than it is in Northern Europe as well.", "It is not consistent, but in general the European economy is still having a tough time and we are hoping for the US economy that it gets better next year.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay. So, as we look to that in fourth quarter if it more of an opportunity on the margin, lesser really from the top line perspective, I know it is a smaller piece of business, but just as we look at that on the fourth quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "Are you talking just on the jeans wear piece?", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group", "No, I guess overall.", "Eric Wiseman", "Overall we do expects gross margin expansion in our international businesses and I pointed it out specifically in the European jeans business, again, over some tougher number last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Thank you. Just a follow-up on the North Face Spring orders, you said up mid, single digits. Is that in constant dollars or reported dollars?", "Eric Wiseman", "That is in constant dollars.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "I would guess you would expect it to be up more in reported dollars given where the currency is and how you think that would play out in the first half of next year?", "Eric Wiseman", "That is what we are talking about. Mitch. That could be a little bit right, right relative to the spring business in earlier on, as we said the first quarter is a strong quarter for us on the international front. Second quarter not so much, third quarter is stronger so, yes the currency could help us a little bit especially in the first quarter.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "I do not know if you said before if you are willing to say it. How much is the North Face business is down out of pre-booked orders versus that one? I would think it is few more towards pre-booked orders.", "Eric Wiseman", "In the US it is 80% or so, it varies a little bit with each year, but closely to 80% margin to 85%.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "It is seems like the sales trend of retail is getting better. The declines are less; there are sequential improvements that we have seen in the last couple of months. What is the retailers\u2019 ability at this point, as they place their spring order? Is there still room for them to take it up assuming they wanted to take it up?", "Eric Wiseman", "Depending on what part of the spring season you are talking about. Yet, there is still time and most of our product categories to react to spring.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "But not at all on the spring display, probably not on the first delivery.", "Eric Wiseman", "Correct.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "And are you seeing retailers pushing out those spring layers with other companies, your initial delivery might be December and now getting pushed into January because retailers are trying to buy closer to need. Assuming that the consumer is buying closer to need?", "Eric Wiseman", "I do not think we have seen, I do not think that has been a big factor for us.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay.", "Eric Wiseman", "t is not necessarily pushing out. It is just a caution in the orders.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay. Input cost, I did not hear you say anything about that impacting your gross margin in this quarter. Is that really playing in the gross margin right now, or how do we think about that going in the fourth quarter even on the next year?", "Eric Wiseman", "The question is on the product cost?", "", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Yes.", "Eric Wiseman", "Okay. Product cost in the second half of this year, we are seeing some lowering of product cost and it is a factor in helping our gross margins to be sure in the third quarter and especially in the fourth quarter. ", "As we go forward to the next year we will talk about that more, but I guess what I have to say right is we do not see any reasons to say that the product cost would change significantly especially in the first half of the year from where we are today.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay. Remind me, were they a drag in the first half of this year.", "Eric Wiseman", "The first half of the year they really were. We negotiated in the latter part of 2008 when things were a little bit different.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Assuming they do not really change and I guess you are working through that right now for the first half of the next year that should be a benefit than you would think.", "Eric Wiseman", "Versus the first half of this year, that is right.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Yes.", "Eric Wiseman", "It should help.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay, all right. On Asia you mentioned you are up to 32% for the quarter, how much of that that was China? And as you said, fairly new businesses were in North Face in China, can you talk a little about that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, I do not know the exact percentage, but clearly China is our biggest market, it is our fastest growing market. What we are focused on particularly every time that we ranked with the North Face and Vans brands and we started building our own platform there in 1995 and that has really turned out to be good move. We are in good position to keep growing there and we have a great team on the ground that is moving really nicely doing our brands.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay. And lastly Bob, you mentioned you take a pick-up hundred base points gross margin on fourth quarter on retail. Is that the function of more stores in the quarter versus year ago, or are you all anticipating your stores will be less promotional given that retail in general might be less promotional since a lot of the retail stores seem to be under inventory right now or at least not in the process of clearing goods from being over inventoried last year.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Mitch to your point, we are seeing improvements in growth and driving that overall gross margin from 2 stand points and this was during the third quarter as well. It impacts the overall mix so our gross margins on the retail side are higher obviously than overall averages and in addition to that the possibility of retail businesses driven by higher gross margin is also impacting the numbers.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert W. Baird ", "Got it.", "Eric Wiseman", "So, we are seeing a benefit from those sides.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Maggie Gilliam from Gilliam & Company", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company ", "Yes, Bob I got a mechanical question for you and that is, how do you translate the income statement of your international  sales done the last day of the quarter, or is it done progressively throughout or how do you do it?", "Eric Wiseman", "It is based on averages, Maggie so to your point I would say, progressively throughout but it is based on the average rates. The balance sheet is obviously is translated at the rates that exist at the end of the quarter.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Okay, I mean is it weighted or is it due to weekly, monthly or something like that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Actually it is daily.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Daily? Okay.", "Eric Wiseman", "Based on businesses done on the daily basis.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Okay, that is helpful. An entirely different subject, you have got a lot of smaller brands that have been brought up very much in this call, and sometimes smaller brands do not do as well as larger ones during recessions, I was just wondering if there were any stand outs in here one way or the other, and I am specifically interested in Reef. Could you comment on that please?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, I will comment on several of our brands having been brought up during this call and our brands is like Napapijri have had a great run internationally, they are doing quite well, they are very profitable and Eastpack was good as well.", "The Reef that you asked about is getting to a much better spot. We have a different approach that business right now with a new management team, and while the business is stable, it has not grown the way we think it can grow. And the team there right now is working very hard to enable that.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Okay. How is though Lucy?", "Eric Wiseman", "Lucy is in the top spot right now. The Lucy business, when we acquired that business we knew we need to address the business model of a specialty retail concept and we have made changes to the business model and we have seen some improvement from that. We have seen several hundred basis points improvement in our gross margin, which tells us that consumers are reacting to the product. Unfortunately there is not enough consumers shopping specialty retail right now, and it is small concept for us, it is a relatively small business. We still believe that women\u2019s performance active space is a place we want to be, we are trying to get that model right, and we are doing it in a recession which have not made it easy.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Okay, thank you. Just one final question if I may. The change [done] arrangement what for Kipling with Macy\u2019s, could you go in a little bit the soft cross behind that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, to be clear Macy\u2019s is going to have an exclusive backing the hand bag side of the business which means it is another side of the business which is around luggage and specialties, those customers will still exists. ", "We have just taken the department stores segment and given that to Macy\u2019s and arranged the building that now on an exclusive basis and that would begin this spring. The other specialty stores that have carried the brand will continue to carry the brand.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam & Company", "Okay. Was there any special reason for doing this excluding other stores like higher end stores?", "Eric Wiseman", " We are looking for a retailer to help us communicate what the brand is around the United States and Macy\u2019s was a great way to do that and they are going to make it important in their stores and that will help expand the awareness of the brand across the United States and the one with few retailers who can do that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Glick from Buckingham Research Group", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group", "Good afternoon, Eric. I certainly appreciate your conservatism on how you are planning your business, but it does seem like this retail or restocking scenario are showing some early signs of playing out with our time of replenishment or order retailers advancing orders 30 days, lower clearance levels. But we hope certainly that it translates into sales increases for the suppliers in 2010 and I just trying to figure it out. At what point that happens and retailers have in your showrooms and committed to Q1 and probably in your showrooms about now depending on the business in Q2, I understand your hesitancy to comments specifically unless your order book looks like beyond North Face but, can you give us some insight into what the mind set of your big customers. I know it varies by channel. But what are they waiting to see as it continues to improve into a holiday before they start increasing late spring or early fall orders book. What are the top to top discussions in general you have and how did it change over the last 90 days?", "Eric Wiseman", "I would characterize that this way. I would say that people are encouraged by what they have seen during back-to-school, but not confident enough to bet big orders, put in big inventory in the store assuming that in the middle and the second half of the next year is going to be strong. ", "So while they are encouraged, I think you nailed it. I think people waiting to see what this holiday season brings because while there was a little bit of momentum during back-to-school. More important to everyone is how the big holiday season goes. I think as we get deeper and deeper into it, the people will react appropriately based on what they see playing out.", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "And at that point that could still impact, I would imagine, the second quarter depending on the category.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. Depending on the category, with us, they can affect next month. In our jeans wear business we can, maybe on November 1st, by the middle of December, we will have new products in the stores. That is not true for all of our categories but that is important for us, given the size of jeans wear is of our total business. ", "David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Is it fair to say that momentum that you said carried into October, has that been pretty consistent and kind of true on the month-to-date period?", "Eric Wiseman", "First couple of weeks is pretty good. ", "Robert K. Shearer", "You understand our posture on this. We are waiting to see it play out. ", "Operator", "We have a follow up question from Michael Binetti from UBS.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "I just want to ask you about the Vans brand for a second, if you do not mind. I think the last time we heard from you that was close to $800 million business last year. Is that number right?", "Robert K. Shearer", "That is right.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "I am wondering if your current thinking is how big that brand can be longer term. We have not had big Analysts Day with you guys to get an update on that a while. Maybe to put it in another way, you think that you are building out the global infrastructure for that business. What kind of number do you have in mind as you build the infrastructure for that business overtime?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I am afraid that I can not give you a number for what it could be overtime. We are working on new five-year plans here right now. What I can tell you is that, that brand has momentum; it has not lost the momentum during this recession. We think it has terrific geographic opportunity in Asia, in particular. We launched the brand in China, as we talked about in August 2008 that has vastly exceeded our expectations. The brand is strong and growing in Europe. It is strong and growing in the United States. It will clearly pass the billion dollar mark if it stays on its trajectory which we expect it will. ", "The question is what happens beyond there and that is the discussion we are having with the Vans team in this room next week.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Now, if I could only finalize it with one last question on the jeans business. I think you talked about on your last call that you are seeing a little bit of impact from moving some products out of the mass business in Europe, in the jeans business? I am just wondering if you could help us quantify really how much that was in this current quarter when that rolls off.", "Robert K. Shearer", "What I can tell you is that for the full year, it is about $45 million. Not really sure what it was in the quarter. Again, year-to-year most of that impact occurs next year, right? So what we are saying is we still have about $40 million - $45 million worth of business this year. Now that was\u2026", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Down about 20 from last year on a full year basis.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sixty five last year.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s Question-and-Answer session. At this time, Mr. Wiseman, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks for joining us today. We are very encouraged by our relative strength in this environment. Step back and we think about the key dimensions of our business. Holding global constant currency revenue to within 4% of what was an all time record in 2008 is something we are proud of. While our earnings per share is below 2008 levels, almost all of that decline is due to currency and pension. The operations of our business remain strong. And last, we are expecting operating cash flows at near record levels in the range $800 million. ", "So, in total, we are very pleased with that overall performance. We are looking forward to getting more than our fair share of consumers\u2019 dollars during this holiday season and we thank you everyone for joining us. Goodbye.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please be aware that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana.", "Jean Fontana", "", "Thanks for participating in V.F. Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2009 conference call.  By now you should have received today\u2019s earnings press release.  If you have not, please call 203-682-8200 and we will send you a copy immediately following the call.  Hosting the call this morning is Mr. Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of V.F..

Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations or financial conditions of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC.", "At this time I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Following my opening comments you\u2019re going to hear a recap of the quarter\u2019s results and 2010 outlook from Bob Shearer.  Karl Heinz Salzburger who\u2019s President of our International Business is also on our call today from Italy and he\u2019s going to comment on our international performance in 2009 and our key international priorities for 2010.  ", "As you saw in the release this morning, our fourth quarter and therefore our year came in much stronger than we anticipated.  I\u2019ll comment on the impairment charge in a moment but for now I\u2019ll base my comments on our results excluding that charge.  The upside in the quarter was fairly broad based in nature.  Our outdoor action sports, jeanswear America, sportswear and imagewear businesses all contributed.", "You\u2019re well aware of a variety of factors impacting the comparisons this year including last year\u2019s $0.30 per share charge to reduce costs and this year\u2019s higher pension expense as well as the impairment.  In the release we noted that if you adjusted for all these factors, our fourth quarter earnings per share would be up 28%.  ", "In terms of our full year earnings picture it\u2019s important to remember that the $5.16 per share in 2009 included twin headwinds of higher pension expense and foreign currency translation which combined impacted earnings per share by $0.66.  We also noted in the release that if you compared 2009 with 2008 and exclude the 2008 charge as well as this year\u2019s pension, foreign currency and impairment, 2009 earnings per share would have risen 2% from 2008 levels on an apples-to-apples basis.  ", "2009 was a year unlike any other we\u2019ve experienced.  Looking back, I believe we struck the right balance between cautiousness related to managing costs and inventories and assertiveness related to investing behind our brands to keep them strong and healthy and investing in growth markets.  Let me take just a moment to recap the many accomplishments achieved by our outstanding teams during this very challenging year. ", "First, we continued the momentum in our outdoor and action sports businesses globally.  Next, we gained share in our core Wrangler and Lee brands in the US.  In Asia, V.F.\u2019s total revenues grew by 28%.  During the year we extended our contemporary brands portfolio by completing the acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands and we are thrilled to have these brands and these people as part of V.F. Corporation.  ", "We continued to grow our direct-to-consumer business with a 6% increase in direct-to-consumer revenues and the addition of 90 new stores.  We improved the profitability of our sportswear coalition, achieving double digit margins for both the quarter and the year.  Our gross margins reached record levels.  We committed to and achieved $100 million in cost reductions.  We reduced inventories by 17%, well above our prior guidance of a 13% reduction.  We achieved an all time high in cash flow from operations of $973 million and we delivered our 37th year of higher dividend payments to shareholders.", "We\u2019re real proud of these accomplishments but we also saw our shares of challenges and disappointments during the year.  Our revenues declined 6% or 4% on a constant currency basis in 2009 reflecting recessionary conditions around the world.  Our European jeans business had a much more difficult year than we had envisioned particularly in Eastern Europe where we had experienced significant growth in recent years.  Our image or our uniform business was hurt disproportionately during this down turn than by higher than anticipated levels of unemployment in key sectors.  ", "While we\u2019re encouraged by the profit improvement in sportswear, our revenue trend is still not where we want it to be and our earnings were meaningfully impacted by higher pension expense and foreign currency translation rates.  Finally our yearend impairment analysis resulted in a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced our earnings on a GAAP basis.  ", "In terms of the impairment charge, we noted in the release that the charge is related to our Nautica, lucy and Reef brands where results since acquisition have not met our expectations due in part to the pressures imposed by this global recession.  As you are all aware, V.F. is a company with a decade\u2019s long history of growth through acquisitions and acquisitions will continue to play an important part in our growth plans for the future.  We\u2019re committed to improving the performance of our Nautica, lucy and Reef brand and we\u2019re encouraged about the opportunities for improved performance in each.", "So with 2009 finally behind us we are energized about our opportunities for 2010 and very focused in our approach to delivering solid top and bottom line growth.  We have a lot to look forward to this year.  Bob will talk you through a number of points related to our guidance for 2010.  I do want to spend a minute though on a very important point highlighted in the release and that\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re ramping up investment behind our brands to fuel market share gains and accelerated growth now and in to the future.", "The release noted that we\u2019re increasing spending this year by $50 million.  The bulk of this spending will be concentrated in brand marketing but we also plan to invest behind building our product, innovation and sustainability platforms.  Our spending is going to be very focused on specific initiatives within our most important and most profitable businesses.  ", "Let me give you just a couple of examples.  Vans has been our most successful brand to date in leveraging social media to enable a richer, more interactive relationship with consumers.  In fact, the Vans brand was recently recognized as part of the Facebook 50, a ranking of brands that are making the best use of the Facebook social networking slight.  The inaugural ranking was developed by Slate Magazine\u2019s The Big Money, an online business news site.  ", "We\u2019re going to continue to build our social and digital media capabilities this year by investing behind proprietary content on our websites, creating new mobile applications and ramping up our social media networking.  On the product development side, Vans will be introducing a new line of footwear in the surf category that is extremely lightweight, packable and washable.   We also have a new upscale collection that\u2019s called the California Collection with upgraded design and materials designed to extend the reach of the brand.", "In terms of the North Face we will significantly increase our North American marketing investment in 2010 to drive brand equity and growth.  We\u2019ve identified a dozen markets across the US where we\u2019re going to concentrate regional advertising feature the brands, premier athletes and products in outdoor, performance, action sports and youth.  For the first time, we\u2019re adding TV and online video to our marketing mix.  Like Vans, North Face is continuing to expand its social media and mobile marketing efforts.  ", "For example North Face\u2019s iPhone snow report app was one of the top rated applications on Apple\u2019s iTune stores in 2009.   In 2010 we\u2019ll invest in upgrades here and in other mobile communication tools to expand the reach of our social media.  We\u2019re also planning a substantial increase in marketing for our brands in Asia where we\u2019re focusing on the Lee, North Face and Vans brands.  ", "For example, we\u2019ll be making a substantial investment in retail fixturing and visual merchandising to support our planned 40% increase in distribution in China which will be mainly via shop in shops.  We\u2019re also funding a new media campaign for Lee in a number of key cities and rolling out additional North Face sponsored events such as a 100 kilometer race in Beijing.  ", "Complementary our brand initiatives here in the US, we\u2019ll significantly expand Vans consumer marketing in tier-1 cities focusing primarily on digital and event marketing.  These are the right investments to make and this is the right time to make them and the good news is that we can fund these investments and we expect to deliver earnings per share growth of 9% to 11% this year.", "Those of you who heard our presentation last month at the ITR Exchange, heard us talk about our long term priorities for growth and investment.  To reiterate, we have a clearly identified list of priorities.  They include maintaining momentum in our outdoor and active sports brands, super charging growth in China, growing and gaining share in Europe, a disciplined expansion of our retail initiatives, intensified eCommerce and digital media support, building on our best in class talent management and development, intensifying an integrated innovation, consumer insight and brand building across V.F. and developing and implementing a global approach to sustainability.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert K. Shearer ", "I\u2019ll make a few comments about the quarter before moving on to specific points regarding our outlook in 2010.  First, related to the non-cash impairment charge, Eric pretty well covered the details, I\u2019ll just reiterate that we are confident that these businesses will deliver improved operating results going forward.  In fact, in the case of Nautica and Reef, that progress has already begun.  I\u2019ll also point out that my comments that follow will mostly related to V.F.\u2019s operating results before the impact of the charge.", "Revenues came in stronger than expected and were a bit above last year\u2019s fourth quarter continuing the improvement in comparisons that we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the year.  Gross margins reached a record 46.3% for the quarter representing an increase of 380 basis points over the prior year quarter.  Full year gross margins also expanded over the prior year to 44.3% which also represents a historical high for V.F..", "We are particularly pleased considering the pressures faced in this challenging environment that each of our coalitions achieved higher gross margins in the quarter.  Our direct-to-consumer business which expanded to 22% of total revenues in the quarter continues to be a significant factor in driving these gross margin improvements.  Our direct-to-consumer business provides considerably stronger gross margin percentages that V.F. averages.  In addition, our reductions in inventories not only provided a source of cash but translated to gross margin improvement due to the lower risk of obsolesces.", "Now, SG&A as a percentage of revenues declined by 40 basis points in the quarter.  Now, there are a couple of unusual factors influencing this comparison.  This year\u2019s SG&A included a 110 basis point impact from higher pension expense while last year\u2019s fourth quarter reflected a 190 basis point impact from the charge to reduce costs.  In addition, our SG&A ratios continue to reflect the changing mix of our business particularly related to our growing direct-to-consumer business where the ratios are higher.", "Our operating margin excluding the impairment charge rebounded to 13.6% in the quarter which was stronger than we initially anticipated.  The improvement over last year\u2019s quarter was driven by the factors that I just discussed in addition to our intense focus on expense control in the SG&A area throughout 2009.   Our full year operating margin, again excluding the impairment charge was 11.9%.  Our higher pension expense impacted the full year 2009 margin as it did in the fourth quarter by 110 basis points.  ", "Excluding unusual, specifically the cost reduction charge in 2008 and the higher pension expense in 2009 we are seeing improvements in our operating margin comparisons despite the challenges created by a difficult economic environment.  Our effective tax rate for the year was about 30%, that included a negative impact for a rate increase from the impairment charge.  Our tax rate on earnings excluding the impairment charge approximated 26% which is in line with our prior guidance.  Our tax rate has been declining over the past several years.  For 2010 we expect our rate to again be at about the 26% level.", "We also provided comparisons in the release that took in to account the unusual items.  Specifically, the charge for cost reduction actions in 2008 and the impairment charge, pension expense increase and impact from foreign currency in 2009.  Excluding these items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased by 28% and full year earnings per share would be up by 2%. ", "Our coalition results were pretty well spelled on in the release so I won\u2019t reiterate them here. We\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have during the Q and A session.  Now, a couple of comments regarding our international and direct-to-consumer businesses, we noted in the release that international revenues were up slightly in the quarter on a constant currency basis.  Now, just to provide more color on that, international revenues of our outdoor and action sports coalition rose by 9% in constant dollars and 7 For All Mankind international revenues grew by 23% in constant dollars.", "These businesses continued to grow not only in Europe but in Asia as well where our total revenues increased 40%.  Now, as indicated in our release, offsetting these gains was a decline in our European jeans business which continues to be affected by a very difficult jeans market across Europe.  Now, in terms of our direct-to-consumer business, we achieved another quarter of strong growth with revenues up 7%.  We opened 31 new stores in the quarter and we experienced strong growth, albeit off of a relatively small base in our eCommerce business.  We continue to be really pleased by the return on investment generated by our direct-to-consumer business which remained above the 20% level in 2009.   ", "Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, we put a lot of focus on managing our balance sheet and cash flow this year and our efforts clearly paid off.  Our cash balance which exceeded $700 million at yearend, nearly doubled the 2008 level, inventories were reduced by 17% and our cash flow from operation reached nearly $1 billion in 2009 and that is a new all time high for us.  We are particularly pleased with our strong cash flow given that in 2009 we contributed $200 million to our pension plan.  In addition, our strong cash generation supported a $108 million spend to repurchase 1.5 million shares and an increase in our dividend payments to $262 million.  Our dividend payout ratio for 2009 was 46%.  So that\u2019s a look back at 2009.  ", "Now, let\u2019s move on to 2010; in today\u2019s release we announced our expectation for 2% to 3% growth in revenues and 9% to 11% growth in earnings per share.  Now, I\u2019d like to state right up front that our highest currency exposure is to the Euro and for purposes of our projections we assume the $1.40 rate for the year 2010.  That means that the impact from translating foreign currencies in to US dollars will be about neutral to revenues and earnings in 2010 with some benefit to the first quarter which diminishes throughout the last three quarters of the year.", "A couple of comments about our pension expense; we do expect pension expense in 2010 to be $0.20 per share lower compared to 2009 which reflects not only the improvement in valuation of our pension assets in 2009 compared with 2008 but also the benefit from a $200 million contribution to our pension plan that we made in the latter half of the year.  Despite the improvement, earnings in 2010 will still reflect an incremental $0.30 per share impact from pension expense compared with the more normalized level in 2008.", "Now, some highlights regarding our guidance; we\u2019re looking forward to first, continued momentum in our outdoor and action sports coalition and strong growth in our contemporary brands coalition.  We expect relatively stable revenues in jeanswear, sportswear and imagewear with higher margins in each.  Next, we expect another year of higher gross margins.  In 2010 we\u2019re projecting gross margin expansion of more than 100 basis points largely driven by the continued change in our mix towards higher growth, higher margin lifestyle brands and our growing direct-to-consumer business.", "As was the case in our fourth quarter 2009, we expect to see gross margin expansion across all of our coalitions in 2010.  Lower product costs will also play a part in driving the improvement in gross margin ratios.  Now, Eric talked about this as well but just to reiterate, this year we will step up our investments to drive future growth.  These investments totaling $50 million will be very targeted and concentrated in those businesses with the strongest opportunities for growth including the North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind brands and our business in Asia.", "A portion of these investments will be targeted at further strengthening our product innovation and sustainability platforms.  These investments together with the higher level of expenses associated with our growing base of retail stores will result in an increase in the ratio of SG&A as a percent of sales compared with last year\u2019s level.  ", "Now, I know this is an area of particular interest so let\u2019s take a moment to talk about our SG&A comparisons.  In 2009 our SG&A expense ratio to revenues was 32.4%. In 2010 the SG&A ratio is expected to be about 33% or a 60 basis point increase over the 2009 ratio.  Pension expense is estimated to be $35 million lower in 2010 than in 2009 which will benefit the year-over-year ratio by about 50 basis points.  So, on an adjusted basis, that would point to more than a full point increase in the SG&A ratio in 2010.", "Here\u2019s the breakdown of that increase, the $50 million in investment spending translates to roughly 70 basis points of the increase.  The remainder relates to the higher level of direct-to-consumer business in our mix.  Our direct to consumer business provides higher gross margins and yes, higher SG&A ratios as well.  But, most importantly, stronger operating margins than V.F. averages so the growth in our store base over the last couple of years has and will continue to impact our SG&A expense ratios.  However, we also expect our store growth to continue to positively impact our gross margin and operating margin ratios.", "We believe our overall cost structure is in very good shape and is reflected in our expanding margins expectations.  Cost reduction is an everyday exercise at V.F. and we continue to scrutinize all aspects of our businesses for cost efficiencies.", "Now, to summarize our margin expectations, gross margins should expand.  Operating expense ratios will also increase, a result of our planned investment spend and some impact from our direct-to-consumer business as I just discussed and operating margins should improve by 50 to 60 basis points.  ", "Now internationally, we expect revenues to grow in line with total revenues.  Now, that comparison is impacted however by the exit of the mass jeans business in Europe.  Excluding that impact international revenues would increase by a considerably higher rate than total V.F. revenues.  Now, I\u2019m sure you noticed that very importantly we raised our long term target for international revenues to 40% of total revenues, up from the 33% we\u2019ve talked about in the past.", "We continue to gain confidence in the opportunities abroad for our strong brand within the V.F. portfolio.  Important also are the higher operating margins provided by our international businesses.  Our direct-to-consumer business should increase by more than 10% in 2010. We\u2019re planning to open 80 to 90 new stores and expect low single digit comp store growth.  This expansion should drive direct-to-consumer revenues up to 19% of total revenues in 2010. ", "Over the next several years we continue to anticipate that our direct-to-consumer revenues will reach 20% or more of total revenues.  Important to our expansion plans in this area, are a higher than average gross margins and operating margins as well as a strong returns on investment of our direct-to-consumer businesses.", "For 2010 we expect to generate approximately $800 million in cash from operations.  While not at the 2009 level, this would mark another very strong year of cash generation for V.F..  Dividends and share repurchases are drivers of TSR or total shareholder returns.  Our industry leading dividend payout will exceed 40% of earnings in 2010 and continuing in the share repurchases of the third and fourth quarters of 2009, this year we plan to repurchase at least three million shares which is above the level of the past several years and will reduce our number of average shares outstanding.", "In fact, we indicated in today\u2019s release that our board has authorized an additional 10 million shares for repurchase given that only 1.7 million shares remained in the previous authorization at the end of 2009.  Finally, to get in front of a few likely questions, our capital spend will approximately $110 million in 2010 with about half of that total devoted to new store expansion.  We have $200 million of debt repayments scheduled for October of 2010 that will be repaid from existing cash and amortization and depreciation will approximate $175 million for the year.", "So in summary, we ended 2009 on a strong note with better revenue and earnings comparison.  But, of particular importance to us was the gross margin expansion that we reported in the fourth quarter especially when considering the economic climate, we look at our expanding gross margins as a sign of strength for our brands and our business model.  We\u2019ll be making investments in 2010 to further build our brands equities and provide a platform for industry leading product innovation while still providing solid returns for our shareholders.", "Now, for some final words from Karl Heinz Salzburger on our international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "Let me begin by reiterating some highlights for the quarter and for the year specific to our international business outside of North and South America.  Asia is our primary growth market and we are very encouraged by our results there.  Revenues grew by 40% in the fourth quarter with operating income more than doubling.  This growth was broad based with very strong increases across our Lee, North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind brands.  For the year, we noted in our press release that revenues rose by 28%.  ", "Our outdoor and action sports and our contemporary and sportswear businesses achieved growth in revenues on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter.  The strongest growth was in our 7 For All Mankind, [inaudible], Vans and the North Face brands.  As you are all well aware our European jeans business continues to be quite challenging reflecting market conditions that are affecting not only our brands but also those of our competitors.  Our fourth quarter revenues continued the trend of the last several quarters with revenues below those of last year.  ", "I\u2019ll talk about 2010 which is off to a strong start and we are looking forward to making good progress on many fronts.  We\u2019re working on five key initiatives in \u201910.  The first is outdoor and action sports growth.  We are planning a year of solid growth from both the North Face and Vans brands and both our wholesale and retail businesses as well as in Asia.  The second key theme is direct-to-consumer.  About half of the growth we are targeting in \u201910 will come from our direct-to-consumer businesses including new store openings, including partnership stores and eCommerce.  ", "We continue to invest in building our retail infrastructure and systems which will contribute to improvements in profitability.  Asia of course is a substantial opportunity for us and marks our third biggest initiative.  \u201910 should be another very good year for us there.  We are planning 20% plus growth and a 40% increase in doors for a total of 1,400 by yearend supported by substantial increase in marketing investment.  ", "Given its premium, authentic and technical positioning, the North Face brand has a unique opportunity to build and lead the outdoor category in China.  During \u201910 we\u2019ll continue to build the brand\u2019s visibility by focusing on core outdoor exhibits and events such as the 100 Kilometer Beijing Race cited by Eric earlier.  We continue to open additional partnership stores while at the same time improving the productivity of existing stores with better assortment planning and customized products.", "Our Lee brand has been a primary growth driver of our jeans business in China and in \u201910 we will leverage our success with a significant increase in advertising and additional store openings.  China is still a relatively new market for Vans but we have seen tremendous growth since launching the brand in December of \u201908.  In \u201910 we will double the footprint of the brand to more than 200 doors, still a small number in a big market where the brand has a lot of room to grow.  ", "Our 7 For All Mankind brand has also gotten off to a fast start in Asia.  We have 15 new freestanding partnership stores planned in \u201910 and we\u2019ve also been investing to support out distributors in both China and Korea to build market leadership in the premium jeans category.  Our fourth initiative is addressing the challenges of our European jeanswear businesses.  As you know conditions deteriorated sharply in key markets earlier last year but have stabilized since and we expect better performance in \u201910.", "We have adjusted our product mix and price points to address specific market segments with a limited premium product offering for a halo effect.  This should provide a significant boost in gross margins in \u201910.  And, as you know, we closed our European mass jeans business in \u201909 which had not been profitable.", "Lastly, we will continue to invest in people and infrastructure to drive the growth of our businesses in the future and ensure we have the best talent and leadership in place for our great brands.  ", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "That concludes our comments and we will now open the line to any questions you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "I\u2019m going to ask you if you would just speak in a little more detail about the jeanswear outlook as you look to the expectations of flat revenue in 2010 what does that presume for the European business?  Is the European business in jeanswear, has it stabilized, do you see it getting worse?  What kind of outlook do you have there ex the departure of the European mass business?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Jim, is your question exclusively about the European jeanswear business or also about our US business?", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "About the global jeanswear business, kind of the different components that get you to a flat revenue expectation.", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Well let me touch on the domestic jeanswear business and then I\u2019ll pass it off to Karl Heinz.  Obviously, our biggest business in the US is our mass jeans business where we have momentum in our core male business.  We are clearly the leader in men\u2019s and boy\u2019s jeans in the United States in the mass channel and we continue to win in that channel of distribution.  Now, there\u2019s a difference, as you know Jim, between what we ship in and what we sell through but our sell throughs are strong and our core Wrangler and Wrangler Jeans Company brands are doing very well, particularly behind new product innovations.", "In men\u2019s we have a comfort solutions program and in the misses business we have a slender stretch program and all of those are working at retail.  Next, on to Lee, Lee really has momentum in the US market in the mid tier channel. They have had a really strong year. You\u2019ll note, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s visible but our Lee business in 2009 was down slightly less than 1% in our shipments but at retail we absolutely gained share in the channel.  It was also about product innovation behind mostly our slender secret program which has been our most successful denim launch ever in the Lee brand.", "It was feature on Oprah and that program is an innovation that is relevant to their consumer and it\u2019s working for them.  The weakest part of the US business understandably is our specialty business.  It\u2019s a western specialty business, it lives in the cowboy part of the west and along the border.  Those are as you know heavy duty tough jeans and they\u2019re used a lot in the construction trade along the border and that\u2019s a tough place for us right now.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Karl Heinz to comment on Asia and Europe.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "Starting with Europe, Asia is actually doing well so we\u2019ll focus on Europe.  The European jeans business over the past several years has been fueled by premium priced products which has been disproportionately affected by this global recession in the last year.  What we also have, we benefitted over the last several years by a strong and very profitable growth in Eastern Europe where we have in most Eastern European companies we have subsidiaries and owned businesses.", "This market, as we know especially in Q1 last year were down sharply in \u201909.  We had certain markets like Russia which literally collapsed and we have currency issues for instance in markets like Poland where we have a meaningful presence.  That is one factor.  Now, going forward what we expect in terms of revenues in \u201910, we still expect to be down partly due to our mass exit in \u201909.  Excluding that impact we expect to be down mid single digit.  However, what we see is a slight uptick in orders which is positive even if we remain very cautious on replenishment.", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Jim, one thing I\u2019ll add to the US picture because at some point in this call it should come out and we\u2019ve talked about all last year.  We lost this one program in the mass channel, our Riders program and it was a big program and we lost it.  We are actually gaining that back inch by inch but it\u2019s going to be a big headwind for us particularly in the first quarter where that program was still active and at retail last year.  Once we get through the first quarter the second quarter will be kind of a slighter impact and then in the back half of the year there\u2019s no impact at all.  But, we still have one more quarter of a big impact from the loss of that business and you\u2019ll see that reflected in our first quarter domestic jeanswear numbers.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "I have a follow up with regards to the US business.  There was an element of destocking that occurred particularly in the first half of last year.  Does your guidance presume any restocking or easy comparisons with regard to that?  The destocking that occurred last year?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "I think in general across all of our domestic businesses, retailers are planning to further improve their inventory turns in 2010 and I think that\u2019s smart.  Which implies that they\u2019ll be buying slightly less than they\u2019re selling again.  Now, I think the gap is going to be more narrow but we have not built any restocking in to our business.  We learned, and we think our customers learned that they can service their consumers without carrying as much inventory as we once thought was necessary.", "We\u2019re not restocking though our inventories were down almost $200 million last year.  We serviced at record high levels, we serviced our retail partners.  We think that the retail partners that we sell to are going to do the same.  We have no restocking built in to our forecast.", "Jim Duffy \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Then a follow up for Karl Heinz, looking at your guidance for the international business as a whole to be consistent with corporate growth and yet 20% growth in Asia that implies declines in Europe.  Are you seeing declines in Europe in other brands besides the jeanswear or is that exclusive to the jeanswear business?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "I would say it\u2019s exclusive to the jeanswear business.  Remember, we closed our mass business last year and clearly that has a meaningful impact.  We see our outdoor and sportswear businesses growing in \u201910.", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Jim, let me just make sure it\u2019s clear that in the numbers, as we indicated that comparable growth overall for V.F., that includes the exit of the mass channel, of the mass jeans business.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeffery Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffery Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just a couple of questions, one we have a focus on Asia, clearly a growth focus of yours for 2010, I wonder if you could share a little bit more detail on for example the op margin trends in that region compared to say Europe and the US giving your shop in shop model which I know is different than both other markets.  Give us a sense of sort of the profitability or how you think of the economic model as you\u2019re ramping these new shop in shop doors?  Then also China being the primary focus, I believe most of your direct businesses in China and India, can you share a little color on China versus India and then also anything else about the balance of the Asian markets, your licensed markets, how they\u2019re performing?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Karl Heinz, maybe I can start, I\u2019ll start off on the profitability.  Our profitability particularly in China is actually at the highest level in the company.  It\u2019s essentially a retail model and what makes it so good for us is it\u2019s a retail model without all of the expense associated with retail ownership.  So what that does is it provides us with a very strong operating margin and again, it\u2019s at the highest level across all of V.F..  Karl Heinz, you may want to comment on the other stuff?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "There were a couple of questions so we\u2019ll see whether I remember them all.  The model, China as Bob said is a retail model.  We had in \u201909 about 1,000 doors which we\u2019re going to expand to 1,400. Now, the majority, 90% of those stores are operated by partners.  We call them franchisees.  It\u2019s a good model, they buy the inventory and run the store basically and we sell to them based on a discount to retail so it\u2019s a great model.  China, the difference between China and India, China we started very early, in the mid 90s we owned [inaudible] subsidiary.  India came a little bit later.", "I would say these two markets are in different stages of evolution.  China is a little bit ahead in terms of consumer consumptions.  We have a large platform, we have many brands there, we\u2019re doing well.  In India we focus on the two jeans brands Lee and Wrangler.  The model is relatively similar, it\u2019s a retail franchise based model but I would say we\u2019re at an earlier stage in terms of growth and even size of that market.  For the rest in Asia, we have owned subsidiary in our sportswear business in Japan which is primarily 7 For All Mankind and [inaudible] and in the rest of Asia we work with distributors primarily.", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "I don\u2019t think you were following V.F. Corporation back 15 years ago.  15 years ago we launched our owned subsidiary in China and we\u2019re benefitting now from being at this for 15 years and having built the infrastructure and team.  We learned a lot of lessons along the way but those who have followed us for a long time, we lost money for the first seven years and we\u2019re now benefitting from all those investments that were made in the late 90s and first part of 2000s.", "Jeffery Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "In terms of the balance of Asia, as a percent of total revenue right now it is relatively small to your entire enterprise but that is because a lot of the markets are licensed.  Are there other opportunities to take back in house directly distributors and licensees and if you trued all of that up to wholesale, just how big on a wholesale equivalent basis in the Asian market right now for you?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "We agree with your observation that it is not the size it has a potential to be at V.F. and we\u2019re very focused on making investments and our team there has made huge progress in the last two or three years.  We really are gathering growth momentum now off of big numbers and as Bob said, it\u2019s very profitable for us to do that.  I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on other arrangements we have with partners.  ", "We do have some other partners, licensees and distributors in all of our brands scattered around the region in different kinds of models and we try to do what is best for our shareholders.  So if it is best for our shareholders to have a partner running the business, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.  If it\u2019s best for our shareholders to have us running the business than that\u2019s what we\u2019ll get to ultimately.", "Jeffery Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Eric, just one other question, any updates on the licensing business that you launched last year?  Any thoughts there on new initiatives?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "No, nothing to announce there Jeff.  That\u2019s something that we continue to work on.  My sincere hope is that by the end of this year we\u2019ll have accomplished what we set out to do which is to establish a proprietary brand business with one of our retail partners.  But, no progress to report yet.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert S. Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "I have a couple of questions, the first one, on the goodwill impairment charge, does this temper your appetite for acquisitions in the future when you look at some of those write downs?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Really not at all Bob, it doesn\u2019t temper our appetite for the brands that were impaired and it doesn\u2019t temper our appetite for future acquisitions.  You know how the impairment calculations that work, it\u2019s an exercise that we go through every year and really the size of this impairment at $120 million against our balance sheet balance on goodwill and intangibles of over $3 billion is a very small impairment charge against what our balance sheet has for goodwill and intangibles.  ", "Robert S. Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I guess following on that one Eric, when you look at the three that were included, I guess 7 For All Mankind from when you acquired it and the trends in that business versus the trends at the high end, I guess I\u2019m a little surprised that there wasn\u2019t anything included on 7 in this review.  Can you talk to that maybe?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Well, it\u2019s a mathematical calculation on what the value of the business is given our current plans for the business and I\u2019m way in over my head from an accounting standpoint but what that says to me is that the plans that we have in that business, even though we\u2019re at a different starting point because of the recession, the plans still support the value that we paid for it.", "Robert K. Shearer ", "That\u2019s right.  Bob, it\u2019s reflective of the expectations that we have for the business on a global basis.  It\u2019s really fairly straightforward.", "Robert S. Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I\u2019m not sure if I missed it but did you guys give your comp store sales performance in your stores?  And maybe any color on some of the different brands?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "I\u2019ll give you some general \u2013 I mean, when we look at the fourth quarter, I think we\u2019ve talked about it on and off during the year, what I know is that during the fourth quarter our comps globally were flat.  Obviously there\u2019s mixed numbers in there with all the retail formats that we have around the world.  As you\u2019d expect our retail formats in businesses like the North Face and Vans and 7 For All Mankind posted stronger comps, lucy, Nautica, a few others posted weaker comps.  The add up for all of that for the fourth quarter was flat.", "Robert S. Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Then just one final question, it\u2019s a first quarter question on imagewear.  So with the Saints winning the Super Bowl versus the Steelers last year how does that impact the imagewear results for the first quarter?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "There\u2019s no team that we prefer to the Steelers and I think you will appreciate that comment Bob.  That\u2019s as good as it gets for us.

Can you talk a little bit about how much more is that in terms of marketing dollars?  How much more is it than 2009 or has there been some shift in marketing dollars from maybe the smaller lower return brands to these higher return brands?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "In terms of the marketing side, just to take a step back, the $50 million is broken out by about $40 million of the $50 being on the marketing side, the advertising side and the other $10 are in the areas that Eric mentioned, specifically the product development area and also sustainability.  A couple of details on the advertising piece, the investments as we\u2019ve been saying are clearly against our fastest growing brands so the biggest portion of that $40 million will go to the North Face brand and then Vans, and 7 For All Mankind and some Nautica as well.  It is, it\u2019s all incremental to the 2009 spend so the $40 million, that\u2019s really the definition of the additional marketing that\u2019s incremental to the 2009 level.", "Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup", "Then with gross margins for Q4 I know there are a lot of moving parts with gross margins so I wondered if you could give a little more detail in terms of how much was a benefit from having more retail, how much was a benefit from outdoor and action sports growing more rapidly?  How much was an impact from it being a better environment with lower inventories?  And, how much was a benefit from deflation and how can we think about that for 2010?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "A little hard to break out all of those pieces but what I can tell you is this, the retail itself drove nearly half of the overall gross margin improvement so of the 400 basis point, nearly 400 basis point retail was about half of that.  It\u2019s the point that we made during the comments that retail continues to be such a strong driver for us in terms of gross margins.  I might also add in terms of our operating margin as well.  Retail was a contributor to operating margin improvement in 2009.", "In terms of the rest of the pieces, you\u2019ve pretty much touched on all of them.  The continual expansion in our higher margin, gross margin businesses, for example outdoor and action sports and also in Asia where the bulk of the remainder, the other half in terms of the growth.  But, I will also tell you that you\u2019re right on in terms of product cost, lower product costs and also just running the business more efficiently than in the fourth quarter of 2008.  In other words, with the lower inventory levels and the efficiencies that that brings, those were factors as well.  The biggest piece retail and then everything else was kind of an equal contributor in terms of the better mix and also efficiencies.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I wanted to follow up on Bob\u2019s question a little bit on the three brands you took the charge on, not so much on the accounting side but Eric could you discuss some of the strategies on those three brands, kind of where they stand, how you view the opportunity there, where the opportunities are or what can be done to drive the performance?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "First, we still believe that each brand has good long term potential and I\u2019ll just comment briefly on each I guess.  Nautica, I\u2019ll start there, Nautica is in a much better place sitting here in January 2010 than it was in January 2009.  We got the business back to double digit profitability and that was our number one objective.  We\u2019ve also improved price value equation of our products there, that was a big issue for us coming in to 2009.  We solved that during the year and it showed up in our holiday sales.  We were on plan and had the best comps that we had from the middle of December through the end of January the brand performed very well at its largest customer.", "The challenge we had last year, the area we need to address is our outlook business.  We didn\u2019t achieve our potential in our outlook business and we are changing our model.  Bob mentioned there\u2019s some marketing investment going in to Nautica and some of that is going to go in to our stores.  We have new leadership there.  We think we\u2019re in a pretty good spot right now and it will show up in an improvement in operating margins again in 2010.", "On to lucy, we reassigned lucy in to our outdoor coalition in the fall Omar and we did that for a couple of reasons.  When we looked at what would help the business most we thought having it aligned with a strong technical performance product engine and a mature retailing group which we have in outdoor, what would be the best way for it to leverage V.F. capabilities.  So we moved it in to the outdoor coalition and it is working with our outdoor teams on how to take what they know about activity based product development and what they know about retail so they can benefit from that.", "We still think that women\u2019s active wear, particularly yoga inspired active wear is a viable proposition and we\u2019re committed to its future.  Reef is the easiest one actually to talk about.  The Reef team has momentum right now.  They had a really difficult 2008 there, we went through a substantial restructuring of the organization including at the leadership level but that whole team is putting together an agenda that is really starting to pay off.  ", "There\u2019s a long lead time on it, it\u2019s obviously a spring/summer oriented business but our spring summer number are coming in as planned and there\u2019s momentum going in to 2011 in the product and brand area that we\u2019re quite frankly excited by.  We think all of those businesses had some challenges that resulted in the impairments but we think we\u2019ve addressed them and are confident in their future.", "Omar Saad \u2013 Credit Suisse", "One more question, when you kind of look at the trends in your own retail business and the wholesale business and you can see the monthly comps coming out of department stores and a lot of the other retailers in the US, what\u2019s your sense on retailers attitude towards inventory, towards replenishment?  Are they still using them to lever?  Have they kind of reached the end of the rope so to speak in using inventory to lever?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Well, in 2009 there was a pretty big separation between what was sold and what was purchased.  I mean sold by our retail partners and purchased from us by our retail partners.  But, what we all learned during that is that we can operate these businesses more efficiently.  The retailers that we\u2019re working with, they\u2019re all planning on getting improved turns, another vocabulary for that is better inventory productivity in 2010.  I think the gap is going to be smaller than the big gap we had in 2009.", "I think we\u2019re all learning that speed to market is our buddy.  Designing later, executing quicker and being on trend are important to us.  Everybody is working on speed and being more responsive in our inventory management and that will continue we think.  We do not see a restocking taking place.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a smart way for anyone to proceed actually.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Benjamin H. Rowbotham \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Benjamin H. Rowbotham \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I just wanted to revisit an earlier question around the gross margin guidance of up 100 basis points for 2010.  Is there any way we can decompose that between the mix shift to DTC versus just absolute year-over-year strength?  Then also, how should we think about the weighting of that on a quarterly basis throughout the year?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Once again, in 2010 we pointed to more than 100 basis point improvement in our gross margins and as we responded to 2009 about half of that will in fact come from our higher gross margins in our direct-to-consumer businesses.  So once again, a driving factor to be sure.  The other improvements, especially early in the year we\u2019ll see those lower product costs helping us. What happened in 2009 was we went in to the year, product costs were up a little bit.  In the latter part of 2009 product costs came down a little bit.  ", "As we enter early 2010 product costs are still at the lower levels, a little lower.  In other words at the levels in terms of where they were in the latter part of 2009.  But, we are seeing some costs pressures in the second half of 2010.  We think that will all net out to a slightly improved product cost picture for us over the year and then the remainder is driven by the mix factors that we\u2019ve talked about.  The stronger growth in outdoor and action sports in particular with its higher gross margins.", "You also asked a question about how that lays out on the full year basis.  It will be a little bit stronger in the first quarter and one of the reasons for that, in other words the improvement in the first quarter will be a little stronger than what we\u2019ll see for the rest of the year which will be fairly evenly spread as we look at the remainder of the year but the first quarter should stand out a little bit in terms of improvement.", "One of the factors behind that is last year we talked about the impact of currency particularly on the transaction side.  We said that impacted our first quarter last year.  We\u2019re not making up all of that necessarily.  You make that up in terms of pricing, we won\u2019t necessarily make up all of that but some of that and some of that will come through in the first quarter.  We expect the first quarter margin improvement to be a little stronger than we see for the rest of the year but the rest of the year pretty evenly spread in terms of the percentage improvement.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David J.

Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Eric, we\u2019ve heard from some other apparel manufacturers about how they see the revenue trends playing out through 2010 being more back half weighted as retailers are a little more aggressive in placing orders second half versus first half.  Given your commentary about the Q1 jeans business headwind, should we think about the year unfolding as a gradual improvement maybe starting out on the top line down low singles and improving by the end of the year to the up low single to up mid single range?  Is that a good way to think about the flow for the year?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Yes David, that is a good way to think about the flow for the year.  We have a few unusual things like the mass business in Europe kind of faded away from us last year and the issue with the mass channel in the US.  Given the strength in fall we\u2019re hoping that we get pretty strong bookings for this fall.  We don\u2019t know all of that yet but we do see it improving over the course of the year.", "David J. Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Then a follow up on North Face in the US, are you seeing organic growth with some of your key customers in the US?  Obviously, that is a mature business, the weather certainly helped the sell through on outerwear this fourth quarter.  Are retailers being a little more conservative in the US next year or are you seeing organic growth?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "We are absolutely seeing organic growth, that\u2019s the first comment.  Spring bookings were a little more conservative.  Now, you have to put yourself back in time to when spring bookings were taking place last summer and at that time everybody was kind of anxious but we did have positive spring bookings but they weren\u2019t strong positive.  Now, fast forward to our sell throughs this fall.  We had an unbelievably strong sell through this fall not just because of the cold weather but because we had the right products.  ", "We\u2019re confident that that sell through that we had this fall is going to translate in to strong bookings next fall.

Wiseman ", "We didn\u2019t but I\u2019ll give you some general color on it.  When you think about the US contemporary business about slightly more than half of the growth will come from new stores and the benefit of stores that were opened in 2009 but didn\u2019t have a full year in 2009.  There will be some comp store growth in our stores.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "Then we\u2019ve heard also from some other retailers and I know you always caution us not to try and correlation cotton costs with denim costs, they don\u2019t necessarily correlate with the timing at least but it looks like the cotton futures are rising for the end of the year and if I think about the jeans business, do you think when you think about your retailers for the Wrangler and Lee jeans there could be an opportunity to take price if those high cotton persists, that might push up your product costs?  Just in the jeans business alone?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "To your point, we are seeing some cost pressures and that\u2019s one of the things I was mentioning earlier, we are seeing some cost pressures and it is mostly on fabric by the way so that is right on.

We really have to just wait and see just what happens on the cost side.", "Michael Binetti \u2013 UBS", "If I could just ask one last quick follow up, on the Nautica brand is there any way you could help us think about how maybe the distribution of that brand may play out in 2010 as far as the mix of the distribution through the different retailers versus through your own channels?  Is there any kind of a big shift that we should be aware of for 2010 versus 2009?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "No, not a big shift, it\u2019s a department store focused brand.  That\u2019s what it is and will continue to be.  In addition to that, we have a strong license business and our own outlet store business.  The area that we have complete control over is our outlet store business and they really underperformed for us financially.  Comps weren\u2019t what they should have been but really the profitability wasn\u2019t what it should have been but I think our new team there is organized around the right game plan and we\u2019re confident they\u2019re going to make progress and it shows up in the profitability and we\u2019re returning some of that to them in an increased brand investment funding.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert W.

Can you say how many of those are Vans and North Face stores?  Then of the 80 to 90 stores you expect to open in 2010, how many of those you expect to be Vans and North Face?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "I don\u2019t have the specific numbers on the 700 and whatever stores you just told me we had, 759 or something like that.  Vans is our largest global full priced retail format for sure.  It was when we acquired it, it still is and it is very successful.  I just don\u2019t\u2019 have the break out of that but Vans is over 200 stores of that total and that\u2019s on a global basis.  The 2010 outlook, the best way I think to deal with that is we\u2019re looking at 80 to 90 stores, two thirds of those is going to be \u2013 this is a global number between the North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind.", "We\u2019re very focused this year in our marketing spending and we\u2019re very focused supporting the strongest brand opportunities.  So really 7 For All Mankind, North Face and Vans will be where we\u2019re focused in new stores.  A lot of them internationally.  I know that the North Face number is I think two thirds of the stores we\u2019re opening this year are outside of the US where the brand is less well developed and where we have great opportunities for growth.", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Then on the $50 million incremental investment for 2010 I think Bob you said $40 million of that is marketing.  Is that going to be concentrated at any point over the year or should we think of that as sort of hitting pretty consistently across the year?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "It will hit pretty consistently across the year and if you look at the revenue breakout it will be spread pretty consistently with revenues.", "Mitch Kummetz \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Then on your margin outlook by coalition for 2010, I think you mentioned that even with sales sort of flattish for sportswear, imagewear and jeanswear I think you said you expect some margin improvement there.  How should I think of that in terms of the overall 50 to 60 basis point improvement you expect for the year?  I\u2019m assuming that outdoor and action sports and contemporary will see more improvement in the operating margins than the other three coalitions.  Is that a fair assessment?  And, can you maybe give us some guidelines there of how we should be modeling the overall operating margin improvement by coalition?", "Eric C. Wiseman ", "Just a couple of points there Mitch, actually if you take outdoor and action sports as an example, yes we\u2019ve been seeing a really nice margin improvement, we certainly saw that in the fourth quarter as well but that\u2019s also where most of the additional spending will be.  Otherwise, yes you\u2019re absolutely right but with the additional spend while we expect to see margin improvement it won\u2019t be quite as strong as it might have been without the additional spend.  ", "So actually the margin improvement is more equally distributed across our coalitions as a result of that.  Also Mitch there were some factors like the European jeans business was a tough year and we talked about some of the challenges that we had in that business and how it impacted profitability earlier in the year.  Well again, we expect improvement obviously in the profitability of our European jeans business so there are some factors like that about what took place in 2009 versus what shouldn\u2019t happen again in 2010 that will help those comparisons.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Christopher Svezia \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group.", "Christopher Svezia \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "I guess I just wanted to follow up on the international piece of the business for a moment.  When you think about your outlook and the international component growing roughly in line with 2% to 3% with the company overall and I know you talked a lot about Asia Pacific and what\u2019s going on in China and obviously lapping the difficult comparisons in Europe with the mass business. I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk about the other segments maybe either by coalition maybe in terms of what\u2019s going on internationally in Europe to still get to that 2% to 3% growth?", "Robert K. Shearer ", "Karl Heinz, maybe you want to comment on that but Chris I would first just remind you of the exit of the European jeans business.  That is impacting that comparison in a fairly significant way.  So as we said yes, we expect the international revenues to grow consistently with overall V.F. averages but the exit of that mass jeans business which was about $45 million worth of revenues, is a fairly significant impact on the comparison.  That\u2019s why in my comments I made the point that without that or if you try to put the numbers on a more of an apples-to-apples comparison the results will be considerably different and the revenue growth rate will be considerably higher.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "Chris, we have three legs in Europe basically, one is the jeans which Bob just commented, the other two one is outdoor and action sports where we grew the North Face and Vans as the two big brands and the third one is sportswear and CBC.  We just combined them because of size.  We talked about jeans and as sportswear and CBC we do see growth and also in outdoor and in action sports on the North Face and on Vans.", "We had good bookings for spring \u201910 and we are in the midst of selling fall \u201910 on the North Face and Vans and the trend is positive.  We\u2019re pretty confident it will be a good year.  Clearly we have, as Eric mentioned before, strong winter which is helping us but not only that, we have great collections and a great business platform.  The we see on the sportswear side which the two large brands are 7 For All Mankind, Bob gave some numbers before.  The other brands which we did not touch is [inaudible] where we also see good solid growth coming in.  Again, we are selling as we think fall but the trends are good.", "Christopher Svezia \u2013 Susquehanna Investment Group", "Then I guess a question just Eric, as you look at the jeanswear business domestically and what Wal-Mart has been or striving to do and I know you talked about your Rider program and what happened last year and obviously starting to chip away again in terms of starting to build that business again but their decision to do some more of their business direct, the agreement they struck with Li & Fung, I\u2019m just curious your conversations with Wal-Mart and your business with the private brand of Wrangler in terms of what\u2019s going on and how you think that\u2019s going to lay out this year?", "Eric C.

I will tell you they understand what they are doing, they\u2019re trying to build some of their own businesses, they understand the importance of having strong national brands in their store.  If you are a strong national brand and if you\u2019re relevant in the category, they give you full support.", "In fact, in the last two years while a lot has been written about Wal-Mart\u2019s efforts building their own brands, our Wrangler displays in their stores are the best they have ever been in our history and Wal-Mart has invested substantially in communicating to the consumers that they are a destination for the Wrangler brand.  I think what they\u2019re doing is they are focused on two things.  One is obviously building up their private brands business and doing that efficiently and second, making sure that their strongest national brands are called out.

Obviously they compete in the contemporary space and at the high end of the contemporary space and that whole channel in the specialty store industry that supported that channel has had a really difficult two years.

Kenneth, at a macro level, meaning a total V.F. level, we\u2019ve kind of restored advertising to where it was in 2008.  2008 was a record year for us for advertising expense so we\u2019re getting back in that kind of direction.  That\u2019s filling the total V.F. advertising bucket to its former highest levels.  That\u2019s kind of the neighborhood that we\u2019re in.

We focused it on our biggest invest opportunities and our funding those brands at all time record levels.  So it depends on how you look at it, at the brand level or at the total level.  On acquisitions, we are very active.  There\u2019s not a lot of deals getting done, that\u2019s probably a pricing situation and valuation situation but we\u2019re still active in the same kind of places.", "We\u2019re looking real hard in the outdoor and action sports industries and that\u2019s we think our sweet spot.  We\u2019re working hard at it we\u2019re just not making any progress. Hopefully by the end of the year we\u2019ll have a different story to report.", "Operator", "", "That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Melissa Mckay of ICR. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Company Speaker", "Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for participating in VF Corporation's First Quarter 2010 Conference Call. By now you should have received today's earning press release. If you have not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we will send you a copy immediately following the call.

Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations or financial conditions of the company to differ, are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC.", "I would like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Following my opening comments, Bob Shearer is going to review the quarter\u2019s results in more detail. We also have with us today Karl Salzburger, President of our International Businesses, who's going to provide a recap of our results in Europe and in Asia. ", "This is a very good day for VF. It\u2019s the day that we announced record first quarter earnings that surpassed both our industry's expectation and it\u2019s a day that we increase our full year guidance for revenues, gross margins, brand investment and earnings per share. The hard work of last year to reduce cost and inventories, while investing appropriately to keep our brands strong all that within the context of a deep global recession is paying off. Certainly, we all expected the first quarter to benefit from comparisons to last year's results when earnings declined sharply. The 60% increase in earnings per share reported this morning is a solid reflection on the strength of our business model, our brands, our operations and of course our people, as evidenced by the fact that we achieved an all-time record high in first quarter earnings. ", "As all of us are aware, economic conditions are stabilizing with consumer spending showing signs of recovery in the first three months of the year. But given the volatility and uncertainty of the past year, it's important to keep in mind that we still have three quarters to go and the economic recovery remains fragile. We must expect that we're going to need to react quickly to changing conditions that could prevent any combination of those challenges and opportunities globally. So we'll continue to invest prudently and stay laser-focused on execution.", "As our earnings power has strengthened, so has our ability to fund the continued global growth and expansion of our brands, which are some of the strongest and most powerful in the world. In February, we committed an additional $50 million in investment spending, focused on our biggest and most profitable growth opportunities. We specifically cited The North Face and Vans and China as key areas for investment. Those investments, which began in the first quarter, are beginning to pay off. Today, we raised our revenue growth expectations in total for VF and specifically for Outdoor and Action Sports businesses and our business in China. And given this momentum, we also announced today that we're increasing our brand investments by an additional $35 million.", "These investments will be in very targeted areas to further strengthen the connection between our brands and consumers around the world. Investments designed to drive strong, profitable growth this year and beyond. All told, our marketing spending is expected to rise about 20% over last year's levels. In today's release, we noted some of the areas targeted for this spending. To summarize, in The North Face, we\u2019re looking forward to launching the brand's first-ever television advertising in the U.S. and a driving market share gains in Europe. ", "Our rapidly growing Vans brand is also targeted for additional spending. For example, Europe still remains a big opportunity for Vans. And we're planning increased immediate campaigns in key cities across Europe, new in-store events and enhanced visual merchandising in Vans European stores. The brand\u2019s a leader here in the U.S. in its use of digital and social media and we'll be enhancing these capabilities in the U.S. and in Europe as well.", "We've talked a lot about our opportunities in China and the substantial growth we're seeing in this very important market. We remain on track to increase the number of doors in China by 40% this year. And we noted in our release that we're now targeting the increase in revenues of more than 25% across Asia, driven by China. To continue our momentum there, we'll be increasing the spending behind our key brands including; Lee, The North Face and Vans. We also noted in the release that we would continue to invest in building our strategic capabilities in such areas as innovation. So yes, there's a lot of activity and investment taking place this year. But these are the right investments behind the right opportunities at the right time for our shareholders. We are confident that the pay off will be evident in strong top and bottom line growth, both this year and beyond, and in greater connectivity between our brands and consumers around the world. ", "So let me summarize a few key takeaways. First, based on very strong results in the quarter, we're now increasing our target for top line growth by 100 basis points from 2% to 3% growth, to 3% to 4% growth. And that includes a 50 basis point expected negative impact from currency that was not anticipated in our initial guidance.", "Second, we're also raising our gross margin target for the year and now expect gross margins to reach a record 46%. This is a statement about the strength of our business model. Third, based on our confidence in the growth potential of our brands, we're raising our brand investment spending by an additional $35 million. And last, we expect to fund this additional investment, and deliver a substantial increase in operating margins, and a 14% increase in earnings per share, to all-time record high levels. Now let's hear more about our financial performance in the quarter from Bob Shearer.", "Robert Shearer", "Thanks, Eric. I'll start at the top with revenues. We were obviously pleased with the quarter\u2019s increase, which was slightly better than we had anticipated and we look forward to stronger comparisons beginning in the second quarter. I will point out that first quarter revenue comparisons were impacted by a total of $35 million in revenues related to Jeanswear programs that were discontinued last year. A good portion of those revenues provided minimal profit, accordingly the reduction contributed to the overall improvement in profitability in Jeanswear in this quarter.", "We're especially proud of the gross margin achieved in the first quarter. Gross margins rose by 450 basis points to a record 46.7%. As in the fourth quarter of 2010, we achieved higher gross margins across all coalitions. We noted in the release that there were three factors contributing to the increase. The first was lower product costs, which we anticipated given that our product costs in 2009 were lower in the second half of last year than in the first. Those lower costs are carrying into the first half of this year. ", "The second factor was the continued expansion and improved gross margins in our retail stores. The first quarter is a seasonally low quarter for retail revenues, but it's worth noting that our retail gross margins increased by over 400 basis points in the quarter. And finally, gross margins benefited from very clean inventories across our businesses.", "SG&A, as a percent of revenues, rose by 110 basis points. About half of the increase was due to the planned increase in marketing investments that we discussed in February. Marketing spending rose 12% in the quarter. Our SG&A ratio also continue to reflect the changing mix of our business. Operating margins rose to 12.8% from 9.4% in the prior year's quarter. Restructuring costs, which were primarily directed at reducing product costs, impacted operating margins by 60 basis points in the current quarter. ", "Now working our way down to P&L, the increase in the miscellaneous line results from a $5.7 million gain related to the purchase of the remaining equity interest of a joint venture, then marketed the Vans brand in Mexico. Now while this transaction will have little impact on 2010 results, having full control of our brand in this country will prove beneficial in future periods. And also of note, is a tax credit recognized in the quarter related to the settlement of an open-tax issue from a prior period. This credit was worth $0.11 per share, resulting in the lower tax rate recognized in the quarter. Our annual tax rate, excluding this credit, remains at our previous guidance of approximately 26%.", "And in terms of the bottom line, EPS rose by a very strong 60% in the quarter, we spelled out in the release certain factors that impacted EPS, both positively and negatively in the quarter, and the benefits earnings from lower pension costs and foreign currency translation versus the 2009 quarter, were of course, as anticipated. And the tax credit of $0.11 per share was mostly offset by the $0.09 per share in restructuring.  So the good news for earnings in the first quarter is that the substantial improvement was driven by solid increases in profitably, in the majority of our businesses, on better than anticipated revenues.", "Now a few points about our coalition results. It's clear that the momentum in our Outdoor and Action Sports coalition continues to be very strong. With revenues of our two largest brands, The North Face and Vans, up 9% and 20%, respectively. Other highlights of this coalition are; first, the increase in annual revenue guidance to over 10%; and second, the fact that operating margins reached a record level of nearly 20% in the quarter, including a more than 20% increase in marketing investment.", "Despite the success we experienced in many areas of our global Jeanswear businesses, revenues declined in the quarter primarily due to the discontinued programs that I mentioned earlier. The great news here is that we have mostly anniversaried these declines. And we expect revenues to grow beginning in the second quarter. Global Jeanswear margins were also very strong in the quarter, partly due to the European mass-market exit but also reflecting lower product costs, particularly for our U.S. businesses and very clean inventories.", "Turning now to Sportswear. We're encouraged by the continued progress that we are making with our Nautica brand, recent trends, in both their Wholesale and Retail businesses, remained positive. Revenues over Contemporary Brand coalition rose 16%. And much of that increase came from last year's acquisition of the Splendid and Ella Moss brands. We are seeing a rebound in the Contemporary channel with consumers responding to our brands' new product offerings.", "Double-digit growth in the 7 For All Mankind direct-to-consumer business was driven by both new store openings, as well as very strong comp store increases. We're looking forward to double digit revenue growth for our 7 For All Mankind brand, starting in the second quarter.", "The Contemporary Brands' operating margins deserves some explanation. In the release, we indicated that the decline was due to two primary factors. First, last year's first quarter included a $3.9 million favorable resolution of a 2008 tax and duty matter. In addition, while investments in new 7 For All Mankind retail stores reduced margins in this seasonally low period for revenues, these new stores are expected to contribute to significantly stronger margins throughout the remainder of the year. In fact, we expect total coalition margins rising to mid-teen levels in the second half of the year.", "And that brings us to Imagewear. The revenue declines in our Imagewear coalition have eased, as economic conditions have gradually improved. We expect to return to growth for this coalition beginning in the second quarter. Our Imagewear business remains well-positioned to benefit in a significant way from improvements and revenue comparisons, considering the efficient cost structure that is in place. ", "Well that wraps up my comments in our coalition results and again, we're really pleased with the great performance achieved by our leaders and associates across all our businesses.", "Our press release highlighted the key points related to our international and direct-to-consumer businesses, so I won't repeat them here. But I will point out that our International businesses should show better comparisons throughout the remainder of the year from, first, the continuous stabilization in our European Jeans business; second, the strong momentum in our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses; and then finally, the continued expansion of our Asian Jeans business. And with regard to the 23% increase in our direct-to-consumer business, that strong increase in revenue was driven by both, new store openings and strong comp store performance.", "So let's move on to our balance sheet, which is as strong as it has ever been. Cash and equivalents were up more than $400 million from this time last year. And inventories were down 15%. We continue to expect, that for the full year, inventories will grow roughly in line with our sales. Our cash generation was well above average for our first quarter and accordingly, we now see the opportunity to exceed our previous guidance for cash generation of $800 million.", "Eric touched on the increase in our earnings guidance, but to add just a few additional details. We increased our revenue guidance by a full percentage point. Our revenue guidance is now for a 3% to 4% increase versus the prior guidance of an increase of 2% to 3%. This revised guidance covers about a half point negative impact from a stronger dollar versus the euro that was assumed in our February guidance. Our euro rate assumption for the remainder of the year is 133. ", "The strong momentum in our Outdoor and Action Sports coalition was a key factor in the revenue guidance increase. And we indicated that we now expect Outdoor and Action Sports revenues to grow by more than 10% in 2010 versus our prior expectation of a high single-digit revenue increase.", "We've also raised our outlook for gross margin expansion this year. Today, we indicated that gross margin should approach 46%, which represents an increase of 170 basis points over 2009 levels. Now as we expect some product cost pressures for the second half of 2010, gross margin comparisons should be slightly stronger in our first half versus second. ", "Given the strengthening trends in our businesses and stronger expectations for both revenue growth and gross margin expansion, we are committing additional funding to fuel accelerated growth in our strongest brands, as well support investments in other key strategic areas such as innovation and sustainability. In February, we committed to an increase of $50 million in spending, which returned our marketing spend to more historic levels.", "Accordingly, the additional $35 million in spending announced today represents an incremental investment in growth given the global growth potential of our brands.", "In the first quarter, I indicated that marketing spending increased by 12% with the incremental spending noted above, we are now targeting an increase of 20% over 2009's reduced spending level. We're confident of a very strong return on these investments, as Eric indicated in his opening comments. And accordingly, we're also adjusting our expected SG&A ratio for this year. In our February call, we guided to an SG&A to revenue ratio of 33%, given the higher spend, we're now targeting a 50 basis point increase to 33.5%.", "Now bringing it all down to the bottom line. We announced today that we expect to achieve earnings per share of approximately $5.90 a $0.20 to $0.30 increase over our prior guidance and a 14% increase over the 2009 EPS of $5.16, which excludes the impairment charge.", "As we pointed out in the release, this higher EPS guidance includes the additional $35 million in marketing spending which equates to $0.20 per share. I referenced earlier the increase in our cash flow guidance, given our expectation for another very strong year of cash flow generation, we will consider adding to our current 3 million share repurchase commitment, of course we're continuing to look at a variety of acquisitions, particularly in the Outdoor and Action Sports areas. Valuations still appear a bit challenging but we're hopeful that we will see some easing over the coming months. ", "So in summary, we were obviously really pleased with our first quarter. And we're particularly excited about the improving revenue comparisons and the significantly stronger gross margin trends that we've been seeing since the fourth quarter of last year. And we know that our investments will not only contribute to our 2010 bottom line, but also put us in an even stronger competitive position going forward. Eric?", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. Now let's hear from Karl Heinz Salzburger President of our International business.", "Karl Salzburger", "Thank you, Eric. Just to remind the group, my comments will cover our International Businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the markets for which I have responsibility. We had a very good first quarter with solid revenue growth in many brands in Europe, particularly in The North Face and Vans. In addition, as noted in today's release, a highlight of the quarter was the 31% revenue increase in Asia.", "We were especially pleased by the very healthy improvement in profitability in the quarter. Gross margins rose significantly, with a substantial turnaround in the profitability of our European Jeans business. We also achieved strong increases in the operating margins of our Outdoor and Action Sports business in Europe.", "The direct-to-consumer businesses of The North Face, Vans and Napapijri are off to a very strong start with double digit comp store increases and significantly improved profitability in each during the first quarter. ", "We're also expanding the direct-to-consumer business for 7 For All Mankind to the opening of a combined total of over 15 owned and partnership retail stores in key European cities this year. For Napapijri, we expect to open 20 partnership stores. ", "In our past calls, we've talked a fair amount about our European Jeans business, which continues to be our most challenging business. The good news is, that conditions continue to stabilize and as I mentioned previously, profitability has improved significantly. In fact, gross margins in our European Jeans business increased by over 700 basis points in the first quarter and are approaching those in our Outdoor business. ", "In Asia, revenues in China, by far our largest market, were up 46% in the quarter due to organic growth, distribution expansion, and in part, to the timing of seasonal shipments that benefited the quarter. Looking ahead, our full rate of bookings are up sharply with double digit increases in most of our Outdoor and Action Sports and Sportswear brands in both Europe and Asia. In fact, in Europe, The North Face and Vans brand bookings are up 25% and 20%, respectively, which points to another very strong year for two of our largest brands. We're also seeing very strong growth in the bookings for both Napapijri and Kipling. ", "In Asia, we are seeing similar strength in bookings for The North Face, while our Vans bookings are nearly double those of the prior year. Our leading brand also continues to show good momentum, with bookings in Asia up 30%.", "As you heard today, we are targeting additional marketing investments in both Europe and Asia. And we have raised our revenue growth target for Asia to 25%. During '10, we will aggressively rollout new distribution in China. We have targeted 40% increase in door count for year end for a total of 1,400 doors. ", "In summary, with one quarter of the year behind us, we're looking forward to a very good year in '10, substantial growth in nearly all our key brands, baked by specific investments to further strengthen our brands across key geographies.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. And that concludes our prepared comments. With that, we'd love to open the call to take any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll first hear from Jeff Klinefelter of Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Karl Heinz, touching a little bit more detail in International. It's impressive, not only performance, but bookings in the second half and I think Europe in particular might be surprising on a general level just given the volatility in some of those markets. Could you give a little bit more color on where in Europe you're seeing particular strength? Are there any areas that continue to be challenging in terms of specific countries, just to give a little more color? And then on China, I know that it's far more of a distributor-based system and the upside, is that coming from regions of China in particular or is it pretty consistent across all regions and it's just distributors taking up product at a faster rate than you anticipated?", "Karl Salzburger", "First on the bookings in Europe, I would say clearly, they're up strongly in the larger countries like Germany, Central Europe, Scandinavia, U.K. We do some weakness in the so-called big countries where there\u2019s lots of debate in the press in the latest days. The good news is those markets, particularly Greece and Portugal, are very limited for our business. So I would say to sum up the bookings are up all over and a good healthy markets. As far as China is concerned, we see two things. We see organic growth in our current stores, it's a retail based market, which is good news. And then we also see additional growth due to our expanded distribution. We don't see particular areas in China, which are stronger than others. The growth is pretty consistent all over China.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "The product cost improvements, the restructuring charge, can you just a bit more color on what that was exactly? And how that will benefit your costs, second half and longer term?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, Jeff. Not so much impact in terms of 2010. Given the sensitivity around the issue, we're not going to go into a lot of detail related to the specific actions. But going forward, we'll see a nice benefit in terms of our overall product costs. And also, part of the restructuring was related to a tax benefit that we'll also see going forward, not so much in 2010, but going forward. So we'll get a real nice payback from both standpoint, both from a cost reduction standpoint, in terms of improving our gross margins going forward and also a lower tax rate.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Omar Saad of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "On the sales follow-through, I mean, you're obviously your sales trends are improving. We're seeing kind of accelerating sales of retail over the last few months. What's kind of the timeframe? Are you seeing retailers step it up in terms of being a little bit more aggressive and what sort of the timeframe for your kind of wholesale side of your business, at least, to follow that trend?", "Eric Wiseman", "We obviously are seeing some of the improvement in trend in half for the first quarter. Now a lot of things driving that. One, just consumers are more engaged in economy and by buying apparel obviously. Second, we did have favorable weather in the quarter. And we had a counter ship from Easter but there is genuine improvement and retailers are obviously incorporating some of that into their fall buying patterns. And we are expecting, for example, our business for the remainder of the year to be up 4%, which is bigger than it was in the first quarter of the year, which gets us to our 3% to 4% guidance for the year. So we are seeing that pickup happen around our world. But we are seeing that pick up. And with the static I lost the second part of your question.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "The other piece is M&A. So there's been some really high-profile activity in the sector and shareholders are getting rewarded for that. How are you guys thinking about it, anything different, any changes on that front? Things loosening up, tightening up?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, I'll comment and Eric may want to follow up as well. Omar, I'd say not a lot of change. We're looking of course and that is continuous in -- or as we have been in the Outdoor and Action Sports areas. And pricing is still a little strong here, given the overall ratio. So pricing is still one of the challenges that we see. But yes, we are seeing some moderation, some moderation in terms of the pricing. So we're optimistic going forward that we'll get some deals done. But not any changes in terms of where we're looking or the size of deals there we're looking at, that kind of thing is consistent.", "Eric Wiseman", "The strategy remains the same, focused on Outdoor and Action Sports and the good news is that our balance sheet continues to get stronger to support it. So we are as anxious as you are, at least, in making that happen.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "So still looking kind of smaller to medium-sized deals, not necessarily any sort of big sort of transformative deals?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'm not sure how you describe it in [indiscernible]. But we've said all along, our sweet spot is in the $300 million to $400 million range, but we can go up from there and down from there if makes a lot of sense for us shareholders, we'll do that.", "Operator", "Bob Drbul, Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "On the Outdoor and Action Sports, I think you gave North Face Asia and Europe, can you talk a little bit about the domestic North Face bookings? And I guess, kind of more on the contribution, when you look at the double digit expectations for 2010 in those businesses, I guess Vans contribution versus The North Face contribution?", "Eric Wiseman", "Karl Heinz mentioned the bookings in Asia and in Europe both being in the north of 20%. The U.S. bookings are also in that league. That's where they are. So we have kind of numbers that start with a 20 around the world for The North Face. And we're thrilled by that and that I think reflects some of the -- our customer's confidence in how well that brand did last year and the uplift they're seeing in consumer spending. So we're thrilled with that. Your question in comparing Vans to The North Face, was that a revenue question or a...", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "In terms of the contribution, like when you look at the double digit, are they equally -- are they both going to be sort of in the 20s or -- in terms of the growth year-over-year? Or was one leading the other in the double-digit number that you're talking out?", "Robert Shearer", "They're both quite strong.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, they're both in the league. Different with it by region, Karl Heinz mentioned how strong Vans in Asia right now, and China. But it's different with it by region, but they're both real strong.", "Robert Drbul - Lehman Brothers", "On the 7 business, can you talk a little bit about the 7 Wholesale business and sort of where the trends are? Are you starting to see retailers come back in to that segment of the business? I guess, you just want to spread that out on the contemporary side as well?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, the 7 Wholesale business is getting better than it was last -- over the last year for sure. Last year was a particularly tough year. But we still don't have positive trend in our Wholesale Shipments business. The strategy, and part of the reason for that, Bob, is we lost a lot of customers to bankruptcy over the -- small customers, specialty stores over the recession. And that's part of reason we've invested in some of our own specialty store business and that business is strong for us, our comps are good and our overall global trend in opening 7 For All Mankind stores is strong.", "Operator", "Jim Duffy of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "I'm hoping we can kind of retrace some of what you said about coalition growth expectations. So Outdoor and Action Sports you're talking about 10% plus. You've mentioned you got North Face backlogs in the 20s on a global basis. I think you mentioned a return to growth in Jeanswear, Imagewear and Sportswear. Are you thinking that each of those can be growth coalitions for the entire year?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, Jim, we said -- in February we indicated that high-single digit for Outdoor and Action Sports and 10% to 15% for Contemporary and then about flattish numbers for the other coalitions. So yes, we are seeing some improvement as we mentioned in the comments, especially in the first quarter and as we look out for the full year, a lot of the improvement and the increase in the guidance is related to Outdoor and Action Sports. But also our Jeanswear businesses are showing some improvement. And were part of the guidance increase, as well as our Sportswear business. So both are going to show better comparisons than where we started the year. And for the rest of the year, as we indicated, for the rest of the year, in 2010, in Jeanswear, for example, we will be positive on the positive side.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "So I guess I'm having a hard time holding revenue growth to 4% for the year, is there something I'm missing in one of the coalitions where I might want to be more conservative?", "Robert Shearer", "I don't know of anything. I just don't know what you might be missing.", "Eric Wiseman", "A bit of color that I'll add because I think Bob's been accurate about the Imagewear, Sportswear and Jeanswear business are going to be flattish. So you have to put that into your model. And when we talk about bookings for business like Vans, you know that Vans has globally a lot of retail stores. So we don't have a bookings number for that at all. Bookings are a much smaller percent of the Vans operating model than our other businesses. And in The North Face, we still do reel outs [ph] and replenishment, particularly in Outerwear during fall season. So you can't correlate the strong bookings necessarily with what the total number will be.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research", "Question on the first quarter. Do you think your inventory position coming out of the year served is a governor on revenue in the first quarter? And then I guess related to that, do you feel like you have enough inventory into an improving demand environment here in the second quarter and into the fall?", "Eric Wiseman", "I would describe our inventory position coming into the year as an accelerant to gross margin improvement first, that's how I see. We came out of year with really, really clean inventories and the right inventories. A lot of inventory reduction that we ended the year with, the 17% was an elimination of excess and distressed inventory, which we forced through the system last year in fact, that affected our wholesale revenues in the first quarter because we didn't have a lot of stress to sell this year and we were selling a lot last year. We're not having any material service issues. I can't remember a year where we didn't have something we could point out that said, well, we're missing something on that, but it's immaterial overall.", "Robert Shearer", "We continue to service the business really well and obviously our inventories line up given that improved service line up with the guidance that's out there and if we needed the chase, we can do so in some categories, not necessarily all, but areas like Jeanswear, we can.", "Operator", "Mitch Kummetz of Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually Kevin Ken, calling in for Mitch.  So a few questions, one, in terms of the full year outlook, Eric, I think on the Q1 call, you mentioned that you weren't billing any restocking into your forecast and I'm sure you saw some of that in Q1. But in terms of the revision to full year guidance, does that reflect some back step or restocking?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, we talked about this topic a lot, Kevin. We don't have retailers that are deliberately reducing their inventory turns by building warehouses full of inventory. We do have retailers who are looking at brands that are exceeding their plan assumptions; Nautica's a good example of that right now. Nautica is running ahead of its plans with its major customer. And that customer is buying more inventory for fall and revising their trend upwards. So we will see an increase in Nautica's business as a result of that. But it's not that they're increasing inventory they're holding, they're recognizing the trend. So does that add the color that you're looking for?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, I suppose.", "Eric Wiseman", "The other comment Kevin, if we talked about our bookings for The North Face and Vans and those are pretty strong bookings numbers, so I think that, that reflects the strength of the brand and how comparable retailers are carrying inventory in those two brands that are performing so highly.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And speaking of The North Face and Vans, in terms of the Outdoor and Action Sports coalition, the profitability was strong this quarter. Can you explain why that was up so much? And kind of what the target should be for the year, should that be north of 20%?", "Robert Shearer", "I can talk about that. Kevin, there are numbers of things that contributed not just to the Outdoor and Action Sports but these are comments that pretty much all the businesses, in terms of gross margin improvement. First of all, we talked about the inventory as being very, very clean. That was -- versus where we were in the prior year's quarter, that was a considerable impact. And product costs were also lower. And again, not just in Outdoor and Action Sports but across the board, lower in this first quarter versus where they were last year. Retail continues to drive a really nice improvement as well. And that certainly applies to the Outdoor and Action Sports businesses as our Retail business grows. We talked about the 400 basis point improvement in our retail gross margins, so once again, certainly impacting the Outdoor and Action Sports. And also in that business, you might recall that in last year's first quarter, we had some negative impact from currency transaction side of things. And that was also a contributing factor, which impacted the Outdoor and Action Sports margins last year and had a lot to do with the big improvement this year. So some of it's the comparisons to last year, but the business is, as much as anything, it just shows the strength of the brands that we have within those businesses. And relative to the full year, now the first quarter, given product costs and all those kinds of things, was exceptionally strong. The number is 19.6%. But we expect to hold pretty close to that, it might be a little bit lower than that given the product cost pressures that we're seeing in the latter part of the year. But it's going to hold at a very, very strong number.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then in terms of the five-year plan, I think you guys were saying that you guys would provide a Q1 update. Is there any detail on that, that you can provide?", "Robert Shearer", "We didn't specifically say Q1, what we did say was that we're hopefully at some point in time this year, probably in the later part of the year that we'd provide an update on the five-year.", "Operator", "Our next question today will be from Michael Binetti, UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Bob, I just wanted to zero in on the Jeans for a second. Fairly impressive, the Jeans are going positive I think ahead of what most people were expecting this year. If I remember you guys still manufacture about maybe 25% of your own products and I think it's concentrated in the Jeans business if I remembered correctly. So I think you guys are now completely out of the unprofitable mass channel in Europe with Jeans and then the overall coalition revenue seemed to be going positive a little bit faster. Should we think about that as potentially being a source of some leverage if that continues to improve in a high fixed cost part of your business through the year here?", "Robert Shearer", "Well it would be, we have a very, very low cost structure. Your numbers are right on in terms of the manufacturing side of our Jeans businesses, it's obviously the business in the coalition where we produce more of our goods. And sure, if we can put more product through the facilities that we own, that helps us. But as we just talked about, we're seeing improvements there and the improvements we saw in the first quarter in terms of profitability have a lot to do with the same kinds of things that I just talked about, product costs and not so much retail of course, but product cost for sure. So yes, we have a very, very efficient cost structure, product cost structure. And from a manufacturing side, that is helping produce the strong margins that we have. So leverage throughout the year, just like any other business yes, we leverage our cost structure with higher revenues than if they were higher than we're projecting right now but again I think we'd see that across the board.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "And then if I could just follow-up quickly on the 7 business. Is there any way -- I think last time we talked to you guys, you thought maybe you were off trend for a while. So maybe a comment on what's giving you confidence that you guys are getting that straightened out on 7 business and then any kind of idea you could give us and how the unit economics that the 7 stores are opening have been trending from quarter-to-quarter like on a sequential basis in the past few quarters?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, I can comment on what gives us confidence in our product direction be back on track. And that is the performance of the products we have in our own stores where we get, obviously, instant feedback on whether or not we're on trend. And our own stores are performing well. So that tells us that consumers are relating to the products we have in the stores. And our team out there has done a nice job of getting the brand back into the right product mix. Unfortunately, we have a lot less customers to sell those products to because of the massive amount of closures in the specialty store industry during the recession. I don't have like quarter-to-quarter trends. We have the whole 7 For All Mankind retail initiative is about 18 months old I think. That's right. So we don't have a lot of history in our stores. We have 30-some stores right now. But we just don't have a lot of history. It's all -- everything is kind of new and evolving. But the products are selling in the stores, that the good news.", "Robert Shearer", "What we can say is later in the year is when we'll see the most substantial improvement in terms of the retail side of things. So as Eric said, we're in a pretty early stages of our overall Retail business within 7 For All Mankind and especially in a lower quarter of revenues, which is, as you know, this is a low retail quarter for us and it picks up in the third and fourth quarters and that's true for our 7 For All Mankind business as well. So we'll see some substantial improvement in terms of the profitability of those stores beginning in the second half of this year.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "It's been brought up a couple of times, but in terms of rising product costs, when do you start entering into new contracts with your suppliers? And will we see inflation in the back half of this year? Is this more of a 2011 headwind?", "Robert Shearer", "It is more of 2011 headwind. So for 2010, and the reason we've talked about it just relative to the gross margins as we go through the year, what we're seeing is that the biggest and the lowest costs, the lowest product costs will be the first quarter. And costs will increase somewhat throughout the year all of that of course built into our guidance. And just a couple of other factors there, for us on a full year basis, our net product costs will be lower on a full year basis in 2010 versus 2009. So again, that's on a full year basis. But as the year goes on, that benefit that we saw in the first quarter will of course narrow so that in the fourth quarter, our product costs will be fairly neutral to even a little higher than they were last year. So again, most of the impact that we're referencing is, will fall into 2011.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "And then you have said during your acquisition, M&A comments, that you might expect valuations to ease over the next several months. And I was wondering if that was something specific that you expect in the environment with these particular industries or is it something specific to maybe what you're looking at?", "Robert Shearer", "No, it's not necessarily specific to what we're looking at, just as we look at multiples in the sectors that we're looking in, where we're hunting and that is Outdoor and Action Sports. We've just seen a little bit more balance in the multiples. What's been taking place in the multiples is earnings were down, right, and multiples were improving at a pretty fast pace as some money came back into the sector. So we're seeing that balance out a little bit. So as we enter conversations and using average multiples as a basis in many cases for pricing and pricing discussions, we're just seeing a little bit more balance come into those discussions. So that's why we're optimistic that we'll feel a little bit less pressure on the multiples going forward.", "Operator", "Eric Tracy of FBR Capital Markets.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "If I could just follow up on the product cost side. Obviously, it sounds like most will sort of be incurred next year. But how should we think about the opportunity to implement price increases to sort of offset that and potential timing and the areas where you might be able to take that?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, the pricing increases, I mean frankly, Eric, that's yet to be seen. And so as we said, most of that will be a 2011 discussion for sure. And it's a question. I think the important factor here is, is that we're not alone in feeling the cost pressures and I know you've been hearing this from a lot of our competitors but also, private label programs will feel the impact of the cost situation as well. So it's yet to seen. Is a little too early to make a call on that.", "Eric Wiseman", "And we will work, our supply-chain is real flexible and diverse and we'll work real hard to make sure that we manage our portfolio sourcing options to the way we build it, which is to give us a lot of flexible to move stuff around to give us as much advantage as we can. That'll be part of what we do in the next six months.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then maybe, Eric, just to a broader question. I know you made some statements in the past of just feeling like as consumer demand stabilized, that inventories in the channel were finally reaching equilibrium, so there's a little bit better visibility to demand stabilization but just maybe, again a broader view on the consumer and the sustainability around this, beyond sort of replenishment and your position on how retailers are stepping up speculative buys from an inventory perspective and VF sort of take on that?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. I'll start with the overarching comment, we're still cautious about our overall outlook for the economy in consumer spending. I mentioned earlier, there were some things that really helped for the first quarter. One, most important was the genuine pickup in consumer spending but weather helped us, it was a miserable-weather quarter, that helps VF Corporation when that happens, Easter calendar shift helped us. We are seeing that reflected in how our retail partners are buying from us. And what they're doing is they're placing bigger bets with your best brands. So to the extent we have real strong brands in the mid-tier and mesh [ph], we're being rewarded with some of that, certainly in Vans and The North Face, we're being rewarded with that. And if you build strong brands and retailers are being selective about where they increase their investment in branded inventory, they're not doing that broadly but they're picking their strongest programs and our model delivers some of the strongest brands. So that does help us. But just to be clear, what that says to us is, we'll gain some market share. We've not built into our forecast, a robust, sustainable global recovery, nor do I think we should at this point.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Bob, from the incremental sort of investments behind marketing, can you talk about sort of the cadence of that from a quarterly perspective? And then just maybe the timing of The North Face TV campaign, when we should expect to see that?", "Robert Shearer", "I'll comment on the $35 million. The cadence of that will be reflected obviously in the last three quarters. None of that was in the first quarter. And it will be spread over the remaining part of the year based on revenues. So as -- in the stronger quarters of revenues, you'll see more of the marketing spend.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And in terms of The North Face, any color there in terms of when we might be able to see that?", "Robert Shearer", "The question is when we could see the TV?", "Eric Wiseman", "TV, yes it's in test actually in Boston right now, so if you run up there real quick, you could see it. But the markets we're going to be advertising in, that'll begin in October.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Can you talk a little bit about if you think about retail expansion, what types of real estate cost changes are you seeing this year from last year, what's available in different types of malls? And then just on another topic, second half of the year in costs, are you seeing inflation? What do you see going forward to 2011?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, on the retail front, yes, costs from where they were a year and a half ago are lower. And as you'd imagine, availability has been better. So what we do, what we do with our Retail businesses at the beginning of each year and even before that, we lay out those areas that are right for our brands. And then began very early on, looking for the right locations. So yes, we are finding more attractive costs related to the Retail business for sure. And you're seeing some of that being reflected in the very significant improvement that we're seeing in our Retail businesses overall. Your second question was related to cost inflation that we're seeing in the second half. That is mostly related to product costs. And specifically, where we seeing the pressures are in fabrics and especially there, related to cotton-based fabrics. We're also seeing some cost pressures in terms of zippers, with the cost of copper going up. And then finally, just the higher demand that's being placed in areas like China. And China represents about 25% of our total product needs. But just the higher demands in China also have some impact on costs that we're seeing.", "Operator", "Paula Torch of Needham & Company.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company, LLC", "I wanted to talk a little bit about the retail landscape and was wondering if you could give us some color on the performance of your outlet stores versus your full-price stores in general and probably cause your brands or your coalitions? And also if could comment graphically if you are seeing any strengths or weaknesses or if there are any surprises that you could share with us?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, most of our owned Retail business is full-priced retail. And we are having strength in our full-price retail model and we have had strength for the last 12 months I would say. That trend strengthened in the last 90 to 120 days and that showed up in our quarterly results. Our outlet stores, all the outlet stores that we have our primarily a use for us to dispose of distressed inventory more than they are a growth vehicle for us, that's their primary focus. And we don't look to them to be a driver of our growth, we look to them to help us manage our distressed inventory.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company, LLC", "And any comments on graphically on your full-price stores perhaps?", "Eric Wiseman", "Geographically? That's your question? No, actually, I'm not aware of any difference around -- not heard reported to us, so if there is one, I'm afraid I'm not aware of it.", "Paula Torch - Needham & Company, LLC", "No, maybe between the west or east coast, are you seeing any better comps in one area versus the other across on your full-price stores.", "Eric Wiseman", "No, I'm not aware of that, I'm not aware of any change from the east coast to the west coast north, south, mid-west, I'm not aware of any trend like that.", "Operator", "Ken Stumphauzer of Sterne Agee.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a couple of housekeeping clarification questions up front. What do you anticipate for the tax rate for the year?", "Robert Shearer", "The credit that we saw in the current quarter will flow through. But generally, we're staying with the 26% rate that we put out in February.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then secondly, the restructuring charge, am I correct to assume that it flowed through the SG&A line this quarter?", "Robert Shearer", "No, actually most of it was in the gross margin. It's related to product cost reductions, so most of the cost was in the gross margin line.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then if you could just maybe, as far as this quarter goes, talk through the puts and takes on gross margin, maybe a little bit more around the magnitude and ranking them?", "Robert Shearer", "Sure. We talked a lot about the product cost. And product cost was roughly 200 basis points. Retail was a little over 100 basis points. We're talking about gross margin. That transactional piece that I mentioned before that impacted the first quarter of last year and did not impact this year, was also about 100 basis points. And then just overall, mix was another 50 basis points or so.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then secondly, on SG&A, it was up about $27 million year-over-year. A little lower than I had anticipated just given the FX impact, the incremental marketing and then the direct-to-consumer rollout. Is there something structurally that was different this year versus last year or have you fully anniversaried the restructuring plan you implemented last year?", "Robert Shearer", "We had. The one thing was the pension, there was a reduction in pension expense that helped us a little bit this year in the quarter, I don't know if you had that in your number. I guess I'd also add that the 110 basis points in the first quarter is very similar to what we're projecting on a full year basis. So it was very consistent.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Following up on the restocking scenario question from earlier today. Where would you, if that were to occur, where would that primarily take place? And then secondly, what would the order of magnitude be? Would it be maybe another week of sales or something along those lines, if you could just put any parameters around that?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll try, I don't know where it would show up, I can't answer that question. Obviously more in our replenishment businesses than in our seasonal outlets the people buy their season up front. We're not expecting our retail customers to reduce their inventory turns by increasing bulk buys in inventory. We're not expecting to see that, we're not having any conversations around that. Retailers are buying what's working. And I just mentioned earlier, our Nautica business is working. And that's been bought more aggressively because it's performing better, but it doesn't change the inventory turn assumptions. So we don't see that as an important driver of our total business globally.", "Operator", "David Glick, Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "I think, we've kind of beaten the product cost question to death here, but I think it begs a bigger question. And I think we're all kind of dancing around here is the 46% gross margin is an incredible number for this year, and is that sustainable? I mean I think that's what we're all trying to figure out. I mean you have very strong brands I think the growth of those brands helps your mix, growth of retail helps your mix and no one knows exactly -- I mean you guys have better visibility obviously than we do about the rate of increase in product costs and whether you can pass them through is the question that's difficult to answer at this point. But when you put that all in and mix it up, I mean what's your sense at this point as to whether the puts offset the takes and you can sustain that kind of gross margin level?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, David. We do think that the gross margin, you mentioned the 46% level, is not only sustainable but also has expansion opportunities. When you look at the pieces of our expanding gross margin, you look back over time as well. The expanding Retail business is a big contributor. The mix, the overall mix of our products in growth in Outdoor and Action Sports and becoming a bigger mix and bigger part of the pie of overall VF, Asia as well is a big contributor to expanding gross margins. And I have to mention the strength of our brands, related to the ability to improve and increase prices and offset the cost increases. I think that we've seen that, that's been the case even though we haven't faced some of the cost pressures that -- who knows exactly what's going to take place going forward. But we think that our brands and the strength of our brands have shown a lot of resiliency in terms of that side of things. So yes, I mean, as we look out over a longer term and we remain committed to a 14% or 15% operating margin and we continue to believe that a fair amount of that improvement will come from our expanding gross margins going forward.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Just follow-up on the Jeans business I mean we've seen a lot of your peers who have these big value-oriented national brands in the mass channel increasing market share. What are the whitespace opportunities for you guys, given the strength of your brands and you've kind of hinted it's some market share gains, your anniversary-ing some losses a year ago and seemed to have some momentum. But how do you, as you look forward, what are the opportunities to get market share?", "Eric Wiseman", "David is that a mass channel question in particular?", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Yes.", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll start with it, our biggest business there is her core Wrangler Men's business, which is clearly the dominant player in the space. It continues to take share from other brands. Some brands were launched in the channel that no longer exist there and that's because our team is really good at understanding the male consumer in that channel and continuing to, year after year, grabbing some more market share. The second area, of course is women's where we have a less-developed business. But it's where we expect to have our greatest momentum in the next 12 months. We did lose some programs in the female side of our mass business. And they are material programs to that segment of our business. It looks like we're gaining some of those programs back. We've been allowed to retest those programs. The tests have been successful. And we're getting some gradual rollout of doors. We have to work across the door that we rollout into but we're pretty confident we will put us back to where we were when we lost his programs, ultimately assuming that those tests work.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "And then lastly, on Nautica, it clearly sounds like a turn in that business. A), what do you attribute it too? And B), are you starting to see retailers recognize the improvement and is that showing up in better forward bookings?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, we talked 18 months ago that we were taking the Nautica brand up to higher prices and taking the products up to much more quality into the products, quality is probably the wrong word, much more make in the product. And we did that right going into the recession, we talked about that, that was the wrong thing to do. People look for more value so we had to recalibrate our product approach. And our group was able to develop products that are really appropriate for the channel at a great value price. And that took some time to get that in and as we were coming off really week comp performance with our big customers, they were buying very conservatively and it takes a while for them to get more enthusiasm for buying more and we had to earn our way back to getting more open to buy by putting in the right products for our customers at the right value price point. We began the journey last fall, it has done nothing but gather momentum since then and it gathered momentum with retailers assuming the business would be down. The business is now posting year-on-year comps at retail and it's being bought  for fall more aggressively and well, it reflects its current performance. So comes down to having the right products at the right value price points and our team at Nautica has done just a great job of weathering this storm and putting them in the position to get back on track.", "Operator", "Maggie Gilliam, Gilliam and company.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam and Company", "I would like, if you would please, to elaborate on some of the direct-to-consumer stuff. You've given the external plans in your five-year plan but can you give us an update for the current year? And can you also talk about where you stand with the Internet and the important brands?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. Our direct-to-consumer growth in the first part of this year is obviously, part new store growth. We didn't open a lot of new stores in the first. I don't have all those numbers, Maggie. I know that The North Face and 7 For All Mankind each opened one store in the first quarter. Vans opened 10 stores in the first quarter and with the acquisition of our Vans in Mexico partner, we got 14 more stores through that. Our E-commerce business is a pretty small piece of our total corporate sales right now. But it is an important piece and it's growing nicely. So it's not big enough to comment on at this point. But we hope it'll get to that point pretty quickly.", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam and Company", "Are you open for business in all the brands at this juncture?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'm trying to think, all brands?", "Maggie Gilliam - Gilliam and Company", "The smaller ones I wouldn't expect you to be but the key ones?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. We talked a lot about -- Maggie, about our top five brands, and our top five brands are open for business.", "Operator", "We'll hear from Chris Dexia of Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I just want to clarify something you had mentioned that you saw in your Retail business, I think particularly with regards to the Outdoor coalition, with regard to a 400 basis point improvement in the gross margin. I'm just curious how much of that is just because of comp growth and how much that of is just better execution? And then overall with your direct-to-consumer business, I think previously mentioned a low-single top growth, previously in your guidance. Has that changed, based on what you saw in the first quarter?", "Robert Shearer", "I'll take the first one, the first point you made in terms of the 400 basis points, the comps store growth wasn't the driver there. It was execution and it was also a better environment, helped as well in terms of the gross margins, lower markdowns, the whole cleaner inventory idea carries through to our Retail businesses as well. And I'd also say that our Retail business outside of the U.S. is less mature clearly than the U.S. business. And we're seeing, and we expected this, we're seeing very nice improvements in terms of gross margins and overall profitability of those businesses. And we expect further improvement as well.", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll deal with the second part of the question. Our comps in the first quarter across our retail entities worldwide were up 10%. It benefited from the things I've talked about already, strong consumer spending, weather, Easter shift. Also, that comp percentage benefited by how weak the first quarter was last year. It was coming up against a really, really easy comparison. So our assumption for the balance of the year is kind of mid-single digit growth for comp store growth. And we think that's a prudent assumption to make given, you know, the usual things that helped the first quarter.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Just a point of clarification, with regard to the Jeanswear, the Imagewear and Sportswear businesses, is that still expected to be flat in terms of revenue for this year just based on your comments about second quarter seeing a lot of improvement in terms of trend in some of these businesses. Is the year still expected flat or is there an opportunity to see some growth there?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, again, a lot of our commentary was around the latter part of the year, right, over the next three quarters and versus what we saw in the first quarter. So in the first quarter, the revenue growth wasn't as strong as we expect to see in the last three quarters, not nearly as strong. So we do expect better comparisons going forward. Still, overall, for those businesses, in terms of meaningful growth, percentage growth in any one coalition, it's not going to be so large. But it's -- the important part here is the trend that we're seeing and the trend that we'll see over the remaining three quarters of the year, in terms of showing growth. The big drivers still will be, the big drivers will still be our Outdoor and Action Sports businesses and which we've increased that guidance as you're very much aware of and also the contemporary area.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Linda Gonalea, D. Brinkley Management Group [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "I wanted to confirm, are you still anticipating $175 million for depreciation and $110 million for capital expenditures?", "Robert Shearer", "I'm sorry, what were the numbers again, you said yes, $110 million to $115 million in terms of capital expenditures and I'm sorry what was these the first part?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Depreciation.", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, our depreciation and amortization combined is right around $170 million. That includes all amortization.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And I believe you gave a number you anticipate for free cash flow and I kind of missed it. Was it around $800 million?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, actually what we said was and that's actually cash generation, cash generation from operations. And that number, in February, our guidance was $800 million and what we said was with the very strong quarter and also increased earnings that we now believe that it could be -- the number could be above $800 million.", "Operator", "Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "So you guys have talked a lot -- I'm sure you get a lot of questions about M&A and you guys have mentioned it a little bit here. But what about the potential to divest some of the brands that are underperforming based on how you expect your brands and I think you guys say you evaluate things as far as financial performance and strategic performance. And maybe you could give us just an update without upsetting any employees that may be listening or anything, but how are you thinking about the portfolio at this point and is there an opportunity for divestiture over the next 12 months here?", "Eric Wiseman", "Michael the only way I can deal with that in this form, and you obviously have been listening to what we've been saying, we look at all of our businesses through a strategic lens and through a financial lens. And if they're not strategically relevant nor financially relevant we ask the question of why should this be part of the portfolio and we go through that evaluation on a constant basis. And then we look at, can we create better value for our shareholders by doing something else with the business but that's a constant, that's so different today than what it was 12 months ago or 24 months ago. It's what we do and we'll continue to do it. That's really all I can say.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back to over to you for any additional or closing comments.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes just quickly, thanks for joining us. We're obviously encouraged by the strength of our business in this environment. We talk a lot about the strength of our business model, the diversity of our model and how it helps us.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana with ICR. Please go ahead.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in VF Corporation's Second Quarter 2010 Conference Call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If you have not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we will send you a copy immediately following the call.", "First in the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

", "I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Following my opening comments, Bob Shearer's going to review the quarter's results in more details. We also have with us is by phone today Karl Heinz Salzburger, President of our International business, who's going to provide a recap of our results in Europe and Asia. ", "It's obviously very gratifying to be here tonight today talking about a 47% increase in earnings per share, particularly following a first quarter where our earnings rose 60%. It's been an amazing first half for VF, delivered by a very talented global team that's focused on winning in any environment. While we did not provide revenue or earnings guidance for the second quarter, it's clear our results again surpassed both our and the Street's expectations. The good news is that the upside was broad-based with better-than-expected results across nearly all our businesses. Not only were revenues stronger than we anticipated, but, similar to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, our gross margins expanded significantly, which in turn helped drive earnings per share to an all-time record high. ", "Taking a quick snapshot of the quarter compared with last year, every coalition posted higher revenues and operating income, and nearly every coalition posted higher operating margins. We are especially pleased by the return to growth in our Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses. We recognize that these comparisons are against what was a very weak quarter last year, but I think it's clear to everyone that there's been some deceleration at retail since the first quarter, and yet our top line continued to gather momentum. ", "Based on very strong first half results, we're pleased announce today increases in our full year guidance for both revenues and earnings per share. We've raised our target for top line growth by 100 basis points to 4% to 5% growth from 3% to 4% growth. Earnings per share are now expected to increase 18% to $6.10 versus our prior guidance of $5.90. As noted in the release, this includes a greater negative impact to foreign currency translation on both revenues and earnings than we previously anticipated. ", "On a constant currency basis, revenues would otherwise be up 5% to 6%. The release touched on first half versus second half comparisons and pointed out that the investments that we've discussed with you in the past two calls are more heavily weighted towards the second half. Now the investments made to date are already paying off, which you can clearly see in today's results, and we are highly confident that we're spending against the right initiatives to sustain growth through the balance of this year and into next year. ", "Also bear in mind that our second half results will include $0.10 negative impact from foreign currency translation. So on a constant currency basis, we're now expecting revenue growth of 7% in the second half with earnings per share rising by approximately 5%, and that includes the higher brand spending. You need to understand this spending is not just short-term advertising. It's also in longer-term brand and product development. ", "For example, we continue to invest in new product innovation at The North Face, where we're on a winning streak of product innovation awards. In the past year, The North Face has received more than 25 product awards. These include things like the El Lobo Pack, which was voted as the most stable pack by Backpacker Magazine; and the Thunder Jacket, an ultra lightweight high-power down jacket chosen as the Editor's Pick for 2010 by Transworld Snowboarding; and the Single-Track lightweight training and racing shoe, which was voted the Best Debut in 2010 by Runner's World. More recently on July 15, The North Face won three additional outdoor industry awards at the OutDoor trade show in Friedrichschafen, Germany. ", "Now I think it's important that I address a recurring question that is creating a lot of interest and concern across the industry. The question relates to product cost inflation and the potential impact on gross margins for both this year and next. Over the past couple months, we've been very consistent in our response to this question, so I just want to reiterate that response here. ", "Our product costs will be down in 2010 versus 2009. They were down in the first half of the year and they will be down in the second half of the year as well, but by a lesser amount. Gross margins are expected to reach a record high this year. Gross margins were substantially higher in the first half of 2010 compared with 2009, and we expect positive gross margin comparisons in the second half of the year as well. The gross margin increase will be less in the second half than what we experienced in the first half, which is consistent with the expectations we laid out at the very beginning of this year. So cost inflation is really more of a question for us in 2011.", "And we're not immune to the cost pressures that are occurring, which stem primarily from the current imbalance between supply and demand. When demand dropped sharply beginning in late 2008, a lot of capacity: manufacturing capacity, capacity to fabric mills, capacity in the shipping fleet and with containers; some of that was closed and some of it was just reduced. But a pickup in demand began earlier this year and in fact, total apparel imports this June were 30% higher than last June, and capacity has not yet caught up, which is driving increased costs across the board. ", "I'll give you some examples. In terms of fabric, prices could be up a few percentage points next year with cotton, the biggest driver for us given our large Jeanswear business. Cotton is trading near an all-time high, and demand is currently running in excess of supply. However, the August and September cotton crop is expected to be strong. That could provide some relief next year. ", "Relative to freight, the log jam in steam ships and containers is showing some signs of clearing as more capacity is being added, but current predictions are that freight will continue to run higher in 2011. ", "Finally, labor. You're all aware of the labor increases occurring in China, but there are also labor shortages in other countries. All of these factors combined point to an increase in product costs of a few percentage points next year. ", "At the same time, following a pickup in spending earlier in the year, demand does appear to be softening some. That could ease some of these cost pressures. It's just too early to know for sure. Now it will not come as a surprise to you that we are taking action to address these increases and sustain our strong gross margins, and we have several factors working in our favor. ", "For example, we have more than a century of manufacturing experience in our owned and operated plants. That provides us with deep expertise in product engineering and factory management, giving us the ability to improve efficiencies to address some of these cost pressures. Also, our large efficient and diversified global supply chain helps us. Less than 25% of our sourced product comes from China where severe wage inflation is occurring. That's a lower percentage than much of the industry. And we still own and operate about a third of our manufacturing, and our labor costs in our own facilities are stable.", "Next, our changing business mix is another long-term positive for gross and operating margins. We've stated our intention to continue to expand our international and direct-to-consumer businesses. Expansion in both should continue to fuel higher gross margins in the future. Gross margins in our lifestyle brands, particularly those in our fast-growing Outdoor and Action Sports businesses, are well above our corporate averages. And as these businesses comprise a growing proportion of our portfolio, we expect to see a corresponding benefit to gross margins. ", "Finally, a word on pricing. Clearly, price increases will be part of the formula for protecting our gross margins in 2011. So in summary, yes, like the rest of the apparel and footwear industry, we are seeing some cost pressures, but we believe we have an advantage business model and a brand portfolio that will enable us to address these pressures. No doubt we'll have much more to say on this subject next quarter as visibility in all of these areas becomes more clear.", "And before I turn the call over to Bob, I'd like to close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of the VF business model, which has proven to be very resilient during turbulent times and will continue to serve as the foundation for the long-term growth and success of our company. Our diversity in brands, in geographies, in channel-to-distribution and insourcing continues to provide us with a competitive advantage as clearly demonstrated in the results we're announcing today. We have enjoyed an excellent year-to-date, but in true VF fashion, we are never completely satisfied with our performance. ", "In the second half, we'll continue to invest aggressively behind our brands to drive growth and share gains, and we're looking forward to seeing these investments translate into strong revenue growth, record gross margins and all-time earnings per share this year and to position us for success in 2011. Now let's hear from Bob. Bob?", "Robert Shearer", "Thanks, Eric, and I'll start at the top with revenue. We were obviously really pleased with the 7% increase achieved in the quarter, and as Eric noted, every coalition reported higher revenues. Also of note is that the 7% growth was negatively impacted by currency translation by one percentage point. ", "Now as we saw in the first quarter, our gross margin performance continues to be exceptionally strong. Our gross margins topped 47% in the quarter with a 320 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter. And as noted in the release, the improvement was driven by three primary factors: First, lower product costs; second, the continued expansion and improved gross margins in our retail stores; and third, very clean inventories across our businesses. We expect that gross margins this year could slightly exceeded 46%, a significant increase over the 2009 level, which was our previous all-time high. ", "SG&A as a percent of revenues rose by 70 basis points and nearly all of the increase was due to the higher marketing investments that we've discussed both in February and also in April. Marketing spending rose 19% in the quarter as we continued to invest behind a targeted list of high-growth, high-profit initiatives. In addition, our SG&A continues to reflect the changing mix of our business. For the full year, we continue to expect that our ratio of SG&A to revenues will approximate 33 \u00bd%, including and of course impacted by the $85 million of growth investments.", "Operating margins rose in the quarter as well by 250 basis points to 10.6% from 8.1% in 2009. In terms of the bottom line, EPS rose by a very strong 47% in the quarter, and as we saw in the first quarter, lower pension expense helped earnings per share by $0.05. Foreign currency translation wasn't really a factor in our results this quarter. So the point here is that the strength of our quarter was driven by the strong business performance across our brands. ", "Regarding our expectations for foreign currency translation for the full year, you'll recall that our prior guidance was based on a euro rate of $1.33 for the remainder of the year. Our euro rate assumption for the last half of this year is now $1.23. Accordingly, as compared to 2009 currency rates, the negative impact on revenues this year from currency translation is $73 million, and the impact on earnings per share is a negative $0.04. ", "Now it's important to note that the impact from our current euro assumption on the last half of 2010 is a negative $0.10 per share, and the negative $0.10 is primarily in the third quarter, which is a big quarter for our international businesses. So the negative $0.10 in the second half plus the positive $0.06 in the first half, really mostly the first quarter, gets us to the negative $0.04 per share for the year. ", "Now a few points about our coalition results. Our Outdoor and Action Sports business continued to power our top line with revenues up 12%. Revenues of The North Face and Vans were up 12% and 24%, respectively, which is even stronger than the performance that we saw in the first quarter. The North Face brand experienced strong growth domestically, as well as in Europe and in Asia. And the brand's direct-to-consumer revenues rose by 13% in the quarter. So the growth is very well balanced across geographies and across the brand's Wholesale and Retail businesses. Vans revenues were driven by 20%-plus growth domestically and a near doubling of revenues in Asia. Clearly, the investments we've been making behind these brands are really paying off, and we expect that they'll continue to do so. ", "Our Outdoor and Action Sports businesses experienced another quarter of very strong profitability, with operating margins expanding by more than two full percentage points to nearly 14% in the quarter. We were very pleased to see a return to revenue growth in our Jeanswear business in the quarter with healthy growth in each of our domestic businesses, which includes Mass Market, Lee and Western Specialty. ", "A 6% increase in our Mass business was due to the strength in our core Wrangler and Riders brands. Previously, we indicated that first quarter comparisons were affected by programs that were discontinued in the second quarter of 2009. Now that impact is behind us, and in fact, we're now looking forward to expanding space again in our Riders and Wrangler Women's businesses as we benefit from a strong pipeline of innovative new products. These factors are expected to drive substantially stronger second half comparisons for our Mass business in 2010. ", "Our Lee brand in the U.S. is also performing well. Revenues up 2% in the quarter. Our successful Slender Secret stretch program has been expanded, and we're looking forward to the launch of Lee Premium Select products, both of which are expected to result in substantially stronger comparisons in this brand's performance in the second half. Our Sportswear business also returned -- resumed growth in the quarter with revenues up 5%. Nautica's wholesale business and our Kipling U.S. business both achieved a double-digit increase in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the progress that we've made in improving the profitability of this business as reflected in the substantial increase in both operating margins and income in the quarter. ", "Revenues of our Contemporary Brands coalition rose 18% with double-digit growth across all brands, which was in line with what we indicated last quarter. Now we're seeing some softening in the premium denim category in the last couple of months as overall consumer spending has weakened. So we're taking a conservative approach for this business for the balance of the year. ", "Then wrapping up with Imagewear. A great story here with revenue and profit increases in both our Image and Licensed Sports businesses during the quarter. Now we previously indicated that some strengthening in our revenues would result in a substantial improvement in our operative margins for this coalition, and you can see that in the quarter's results. Our competitive advantage from a quick response and replenishment capabilities is benefiting both businesses as demand improves. ", "Well, that does it for our coalition results. The release also touched on our international and direct-to-consumer results, so just a couple of comments here. As expected, our international revenue performance strengthened in the second quarter with a 6% increase in constant dollars. Currency translation did hurt us by the percentage points, so the reported increased was 3%. Now as in prior quarters, our performance in Asia was a real standout with revenue growth of 26% in the quarter with double-digit growth in The North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind brands. ", "We're on track with our retail store openings this year, having opened 41 stores to-date out of a total of 80 to 90 stores planned for the year. Our direct-to-consumer revenues were up 7% in the quarter. ", "So let's move on to the balance sheet, which continues to be a real strength for VF. Cash and equivalents were $540 million at the end of the quarter, and inventories were down 10% from prior year levels. By year end, considering the significant decline in inventories by the end of 2009, inventory levels should grow in line with sales. Our cash generation continues to be very strong, and we now expect that cash flow from operations will approximate $850 million. ", "We did put our cash to work during the first half, repurchasing 4 million shares for $318 million. And the total shares purchased were 1 million higher than what we discussed last quarter. We'll continue to evaluate the best uses for our cash going forward. Acquisitions clearly remain our priority.", "Eric has pretty well covered our outlook for the year. I'll just add a couple of other points. Our tax rate all-in should approximate 25 \u00bd% for the full year. Our operating margins for the full year will reflect substantial improvement over 2009 to just below 13% despite the incremental growth investments, and capital spending for the year should remain pretty much on target at about $110 million. ", "So in summary, we're really pleased with our results to-date this year. To be sure, we do have some concerns about the overall environment for the rest of this year and into next, but our results clearly indicate that strong, highly profitable brands with compelling products that speak to consumers' needs will continue to succeed regardless of the external environment. Eric?", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. Now let's wrap up with some comments from Karl Heinz Salzburger, Vice President of VF International. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Salzburger", "Yes, thank you, Eric. Just to remind the group, my comments will cover our international businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the markets for which I have responsibility. On a constant dollar basis, growth in revenues in these markets were up nearly 4% in the second quarter. We enjoyed solid growth in our Outdoor and Action Sports business, which is primarily The North Face and Vans; our Sportswear and Contemporary Brands business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Napapijri and Kipling; and in our Asia businesses. ", "During the quarter, we also continued to improve profitability with operating margins of our international businesses rising more than 200 basis points. Despite a lot of well-publicized concerns regarding the market trends in Europe, our major brands continued to perform strongly. Year-to-date, The North Face stores have achieved double-digit comp store growth and fall bookings are up 25%. ", "Vans stores have also achieved double-digit comp store growth through the first half of the year with fall and holiday bookings also up 25%. We have been steadily increasing our investments behind both brands to drive growth and market share gains in Europe and are very encouraged by the results we are seeing to-date. ", "Our 7 For All Mankind brand continues to expand in Europe with 24% revenue growth in the second quarter. Strong bookings and additional new stores should drive double-digit growth in the second half of the year as well. New stores opened in the quarter included Milan, Berlin and Antwerp, and we are looking forward to opening our second store in Paris this quarter. We remain on plan to open a combined total of about 15 owned and partnership retail stores in key European cities this year. ", "Our Napapijri brand also continues to perform very well, with 7% revenue growth in constant dollars during the quarter, double-digit comp store growth in the first half and fall bookings up 15%. There were a couple bright spots in our European Jeanswear business in the quarter. Our Wrangler brand posted a moderate growth in constant dollar in the quarter. The brand's cutting edge marketing campaign continues to gain accolades, winning five awards at the prestigious Cannes International Advertising Festival. While the profitability of our Jeans business continues to improve, overall, this business continues to be our most challenging.", "The momentum continues in Asia with revenues up 26% in the quarter. We enjoyed exceptionally strong results in The North Face, Vans and Kipling businesses in China. While still a relatively small market for us currently, we're also making very good progress in India, where revenues grew by more than 50% in constant dollars during the quarter.", "As you have heard us discuss in past calls, we have committed to a substantial increase in marketing in China this year. We're on track to aggressively expand distribution in China. We have 40% targeted increase in door count by year end, or 1,400 stores, which should help drive our goal of 25% revenue increase across Asia in '10.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. That concludes our comments. We'd love to hear your questions. And, Stacey, could you open up the line for questions for us?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Eric, you commented that for cotton, we may possibly see an easing of prices in the cost of this commodity if the crop is strong in August and September. Will you still be negotiating prices at this point for spring 2011? Or will you be locked in by that time?", "Eric Wiseman", "We'll have some flexibility in later spring, kind of mid- to late spring pricing. That depends on how good the crop is too, Kate. There's a couple pieces that move there that make your question a hard one to answer precisely. We've certainly established our pricing agreements through this fall, and depending on when it feels like the crop might be good, that'll partially drive that, but what it would be by mid-spring at latest.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And just one more question on the cost front. I would expect that you would see more pricing pressure in your Jeanswear business just because of how much cotton composes of that category. Do you have any pricing power in your Jeanswear business, that 30% of your total sales? Or will we see more margin pressure in this category while you take price increases in other categories?", "Eric Wiseman", "We absolutely have some pricing options in our Jeans business. One of the reasons we're so focused on the strategy of innovation is because we have learned over the past few years in particular, when we create innovative products that consumers really want, they helped us sustain some revenue momentum during the recession, and we've charged a fair price for this. In fact, our average unit price at Lee has gone up through the recession and it's because we've been innovative. So the combination of innovation and the strength of our brands gives us some flexibility. But you're right; that is where we have our biggest pressure point. We have plenty of product categories that between the fabrics that go into the products and the locations that they're made aren't really experiencing inflationary pressures right now. So you know how diverse we are in our business mix and we're as diverse in the inflationary pressures.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. If I could squeeze one more in about SG&A and your spending in the back half of the year. I know you're not giving quarterly guidance, but can you give any kind of comments around how we should drive our model with SG&A spending Q3 and Q4? Will we see more in Q3 going into holiday? Or will we see more spending in Q4? Or will it be evenly distributed?", "Eric Wiseman", "Kate, I can't answer that, but Bob would love to.", "Robert Shearer", "For the second half of the year, the way to think SG&A is that the ratio, the percent of revenues will be up just a little over 100 basis points actually in each quarter. And the marketing spend actually, when you do the math, right, and the $65 million out of the $85 million, and that's obviously a little abnormally second half weighted. It's more weighted to the second half than we'd normally expect to see but the $65 million actually would drive about 150 basis points of increase over that period of time. So there are some offsets, a little lower pension expense as an example. But we'll net down to just a little over 100 basis points per quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Eric, so a little bit of history view here, if you look back historically, the relationship between cost at the border, say, and price at retail, has there been a linear relationship? Or in times when you see costs go up, has historically has it been difficult to pass that through at retail?", "Eric Wiseman", "I have to think about that a little bit. We have not had problems in historically in addressing substantially all of the inflation we've seen coming at us, whether it was from labor or from other cost of goods. Over time, we have been able to address substantially all of it, and we expect that would be the case next year as well.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Is that VF specific? Or based on your historical perspective, is that kind of an overall industry dynamic?", "Eric Wiseman", "No, I can only speak to VF specific. I know that we have such strong brands that are in great demand by consumers. That helps us address some of that. And how efficient we are, I mentioned in the call, a third of our production comes from factories that we own and operate, and we are not having labor inflation there or were able to offset it by efficiencies based on how well we run factories. So we're just not seeing it there. So I understand there's a really big question out there, but we're pretty confident that we have work to do and the story is not yet fully told, but I'm real confident in our team's ability to address substantially all of this.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yes, given your sourcing base, it seems you're better insulated than many sounding so [ph]. You've begun the booking process with some of your brands for spring. Early days yet, but what are you hearing from the mindset of retailers as you have those discussions?", "Eric Wiseman", "There's caution back in people's voices right now in general about the market. The slowdown that we've all seen happen since I guess the second week in May has had everybody ask, how confident should we be in placing spring orders? The good news for us, if you look at what happened during even the recession when there was more than just a little caution, there was widespread caution; we continued to get pretty good bookings for most of our business. You know that in 2008, we had a good revenue year. Last year, we were down 4% on a constant currency basis across our company, and we're pretty confident that we've got the right brands and the right products within our brands to do better than most in that. And in fact, as people are getting more selective about what they buy, they're looking to leading brands, if you're looking to leading brands, you're looking to brands like Wrangler and you're looking to brands like Vans and The North Face. So we're pretty confident about next year.", "Jim Duffy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, and then final question for Karl Heinz: Can you provide an update on your progress with the Vans brand in China? And some thoughts on the outlook for that business over the next couple years?", "Eric Wiseman", "Karl Heinz, you got it? Can you hear it?", "Karl Salzburger", "Yes, I got it. You heard me saying that before, we had a very,very strong quarter with Vans in China, which nearly doubled the business. Vans, we see Vans as a big opportunity for us in China. We just started basically a couple of seasons ago. We have very talented management on the spot, management which knows about footwear, and it's one of the brands where we certainly will do better and become a big opportunity for us in China. We open a store, we have a big store's [ph] rollout and I can't quote what the company is [ph] longer term, but certainly it's one of the top opportunities we have.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Eric, I just have some questions on the Mass Jeanswear business. There was recently a change of the U.S. business for one of your largest customers and I was wondering if you saw any major strategic changes that might positively or negatively impact your business. And some of the changes or the moves in your Riders and Wrangler Women's businesses, is that due to the change in strategy or anything that we should think about?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, Bob talked about the acceleration of our progress in our Mass Jeans business during his comments. And what's driving that, there are a couple things. We have been talking for a while about programs that we lost with one of our large Mass customers, and we are regaining some of those programs and permission I think to gain them all back. Some of them were in test. Some of them are further than test into full rollouts, so that's to our team's tenacity in not giving up on those programs because we believe they were the right things for that customer, and we're giving permission to, at a minimum, test them and, as a best case, roll them out. You've heard comments about one of our customers talking about returning to basics, and they've specifically mentioned things like jeans and tees. So any time we have a large customer on jeans, when we're their largest provider of national branded jeans, that creates an opportunity for us and we're working very closely with that customer to help them get back to the more basic apparel business. I think it's the right move for them, and they'll execute it really well. We're really confident they can execute that well, and we're happy to be a partner in that with them.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Great, and, Bob, I have a question for you on product costs. I think Eric said that you would have lower product costs for the remainder of the year. I think in previous calls, you had mentioned that you thought you would have higher year-over-year costs beginning in the fourth quarter. What has changed from that perspective?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, Eric's comment was for the second half. So the cost, as you might expect, Bob, increasing a little bit as each quarter goes on. So for the fourth quarter, what I've indicated in the past is that costs, or product costs, when you compare year-to-year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter of last year, right, that the costs will be up just a little bit over where they were last year in the third quarter; they'll still be below, and that nets to being just slightly below for the second half of the year. The reality is that costs year-to-year, when you look at the second half of 2010 versus the second half of 2009, again, down a little bit on a net basis, but fairly neutral.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then just one final question for Karl Heinz: The strong bookings that you talked about within the European business, do you think there's much risk to those bookings at this point in time?", "Eric Wiseman", "Karl Heinz?", "Karl Salzburger", "Yes, Bob. Historically, we have seen, especially on the brands I mentioned where we have the strong bookings, that the cancellation rate is pretty modest now. We haven't seen in the first semester a change of that cancellation rate. So honestly, we don't expect major surprises on the strong bookings even for the second semester.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I wanted to ask a question on priorities for cash flow. It looks like you're buying back stock more aggressively than you have in the past. What are the key decision factors there? How are you thinking about buying your own brands versus going out in the M&A markets and picking up some brands? And I also have a question on the marketing and advertising spend. I thought you made an interesting comment, that you're seeing a nice pickup in the areas where you're spending on marketing and advertising dollars. Could you give us some more color there in how that makes you feel about where the consumer is?", "Robert Shearer", "Omar, I'll start on the first part of the question relative to priorities for cash. We did. We expected to buy back 3 million shares in the first half of the year, and that was our communication. And when the market fell off a little bit, as the market fell off a little bit, we were seeing strengthening in our cash generation for the year and our cash position, the resulting cash position. So it felt like we could and should go out and buy an additional million shares. Having said that, our priority, as I said in my comments, our priority remains on the acquisition front. That is where we want to invest, and that's been pretty consistent over a period of years. So we saw the opportunity, we upped the buyback a little bit even in the second half the year. We could do a little more from that standpoint, but it's not a change in strategy or focus. Our focus remains on the acquisition front. Eric, do you want to take...", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Omar. I'll deal with the second part of your question, which was about where we're seeing proven results from investments that we've made in the business this year. I'll give you a couple examples. One is the Nautica Father's Day TV campaign that we ran in partnership with Macy's. We did that in two markets as a test. We did that in New York, and we did it in Florida. I won't give you specific numbers because I'd rather keep that as internal information. But they were very encouraging, enough so that we're hoping to do more of that and increase that investment with Macy's later on this year. Another is Vans in Europe, where we in June I guess ran an outdoor campaign in several cities. I think we were in six or seven cities and, Karl Heinz, correct me if I get this wrong, we did in some cases just a lot of outdoor billboards, and I said [ph] we took a few markets and did big splashes of Vans awareness, talking about the history of the brand and the products that we sell. And we saw an immediate lift in both our sell-through at retail and in immediate bookings went up. Karl Heinz, do you have any color to add to that comment about Vans?", "Karl Salzburger", "No, you said it all, Eric.", "Eric Wiseman", "And the last example I'll give you is in the script, Omar, I talked about the product awards we're getting at The North Face. We are making substantial investments in both consumer insights to inform us about the products that we should be making; in our business model, around the activity-based model; and in people to help create really compelling product, and some of that shows up in awards. It also show up in momentum with your brand, and for us to keep a brand that big going, we have to continue to create amazing products. So we're investing in that, and that's a long-term investment. Is that enough examples?", "Omar Saad - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "No, that's great.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question comes from Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Vans, obviously a great quarter. Can you talk about the domestic growth? I think you said it was up 20%. Can you walk through like the combination of that growth, whether it's through new doors or the reintroduction of new doors to the brand or comp store growth? And how the comps were within your existing wholesale accounts for Vans domestically?", "Robert Shearer", "Sean, this is Bob. Most of the growth by far, about 75% actually of the growth came from our wholesale business. So the remainder was primarily from opening new stores. So again, just a great story around Vans, just an incredible quarter and year so far, and especially in the fact that most of that growth has been driven by the wholesale side of things.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then has there been any change in the penetration of apparel and footwear? Or are you still tracking kind of that 7.25 [ph] range?", "Robert Shearer", "It's still tracking pretty close to where it was on the wholesale side. A little bit more of that is in the apparel side of the business, so it's getting a little bit of strength. It is gaining some strength, but still overall for the brand, pretty close to where we've been.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sean, the thing I would add to that is Karl Heinz just talk in answering another question about Vans' success in China, and I just mentioned our investment in Vans in Europe in select cities. The Vans brand we are highly confident can continue to grow, and we're investing in it to deliver that growth. It's a very strong brand.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Great. Can you discuss any -- are there any delays or anything you're seeing within the supply chain right now where you guys are having trouble getting the goods that you've placed order for, for the fall or getting here domestically?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Sean, we don't have huge challenges there. There is a shortage of both ships and containers. But during non-peak times, just a normal kind of fall demand, we're having to scramble during really peak months where there's a lot of stuff coming at us, and that's true for back-to-school, so we're experiencing that now, and it'll be true for holiday. What our experience has been for back-to-school is that we've been able to work around it, and we're having minor delays, a week delay getting the stuff here, which doesn't affect our ability to get product to market. It's taken a whole lot more work from our supply chain team to get them here, but they are able to get them here reasonably on time.", "Sean Naughton - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And is it just a change in mix in terms of how you're importing in terms of air freight or anything like that? Are you having to increase that percentage of the goods that you're bringing in?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, a little bit more air freight for us this year. It's a surprising statistic. And I'm getting very granular here. In a normal year, about 2 million new containers go into service, and some go out of service, right. They need to removed from the chain. Last year, only 200,000 new containers went into service. So it was a 90% reduction in the introduction of new containers into the system, and that's what's creating a lot of this pressure right now. That industry is getting back and refueling that demand, but it's taking a while. But as I said, we're able to work around it pretty well.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "If I piece together a few of your comments from today, it sounds like you're fairly confident for some of the orders, at least in your key growth driver brands, that you're seeing in early-on discussions for 2011, and you think you have enough pricing power across the portfolio to help offset some cost inflation that everybody's starting to talk about. And you also pointed to the ongoing mix of the business. I know it's a little early to talk about 2011 at this point, but since you guys gave quite a bit of helpful detail, I'm looking at least into the early part of the year, is there any reason at this point that we shouldn't expect gross margins for VF Corp to keep expanding in the first part of 2011 in our models?", "Eric Wiseman", "Michael, as you said, we did provide a lot of details and a lot of color around the numbers, but we just continue to believe it's just a little too early, right, it's just a little too early to comment on that. What we've tried to point out are all the pieces that we're looking at, all the areas of opportunities that we have, all the actions that we're taking to address that, but you'll hear a lot more about 2011 in the very near future.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "All right. Then maybe I can just ask a question about North Face, and I'm looking at the U.S. business for North Face. Obviously, it's very back-weighted for the profitably of that brand. Could you help us look at how the total -- how your order book looks for the U.S. for North Face? And then maybe in particular how ASPs look on a year-over-year basis in the orders that you guys have on the books right now?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, the last time we got together, actually, we talked about our order positions being actually globally up 20%, and that obviously is we haven't seen any falloff from that, so that business, as you said, continues to perform really well, and the order position that we're seeing for fall shipments remains quite strong.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Any comments on ASPs?", "Eric Wiseman", "I know we're not under any pressure. My guess is -- I don't know the answer to that. I won't guess at it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Todd Slater with Lazard Capital.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Could you tell us what the -- just how much Europe was up overall and maybe provide a little bit of color on some of the specific countries? And then just back to the ASP question, I'm just trying to get my arms around it. It sounds like you're planning to offset some if not all of the sourcing and other cost increases with some pricing increases, and you talked about innovation and ways in which you could achieve that. And I'm just wondering in the fourth quarter and maybe in 2011, should we expect your average ASPs or unit prices to move up roughly in line with the sourcing inflation that exists? And if so, what would be a sort of good starting point? And then lastly, you said that the retailers are getting a little more cautious, and I'm just wondering if you'd seen if any of the big department stores have indicated that they might want to be a little more conservative on the back half deliveries.", "Robert Shearer", "I'll start on a couple of those. We were both writing down as you're asking your questions, Todd. First of all, the international business, I made a comment that our total international business on a constant dollar basis increased by 6% in the quarter. It was impacted by translation. So that pulled it down to about 3%. In terms of ASPs, yes, I think it is fair to assume that as we've indicated, we clearly see pricing increase potential for our brands as we move into next year. So again, all things being equal, yes, we will see some price increases next year clearly across our businesses.", "Eric Wiseman", "On the question about are retailers getting cautious and how are we seeing that, we've had some very few instances of kind of cancellations and delays in terms of materiality to overall VF. So we have seen it's been very spotty, but it has not been a big issue or material issue in terms of a discussion we would have.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, and the question on international, I was curious about Europe specifically. I got the overall international and I think you mentioned Asia up 26% and India up 50%. Could you give us the European numbers? And maybe talk a little bit about some of the specific countries and what you're seeing there?", "Eric Wiseman", "Bob and I are looking at each other; neither of us have the specific numbers for Europe. Karl Heinz, do you want to talk about the BRIC countries and what's going on there and how important or unimportant they are to our overall mix?", "Karl Salzburger", "Yes. Clearly, it's publicized a lot, the BRIC countries are not in the best shape, to come to the point. The good news is it's a relatively modest business for us, so our exposure is relatively thin there. We haven't released a number for Europe, so what I can say, we have three coalitions, I mean three big businesses: One is Outdoor and Action Sports, one is Sportswear, the third one is Jeans. And two, we're growing; and one, remember on Jeans, we closed the Mass business last year. So we are showing negative growth but it's not really comparable. But we did mention that Wrangler had good results in the quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "Todd, does that help you?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, Todd, I can give you a little bit more on that. In constant dollars, our growth in Outdoor and Action Sports was high single-digit kind of growth. However, in our Jeans business, that pulled that down. And so again, that business is still -- it's more stable than it was, but it's still declining a bit even in constant dollars. So those are the two significant factors. But the point is by far, our largest business and fastest-growing business there, which is our Outdoor and Action Sports, that continues to grow at a nice pace.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Great, that's very helpful. And just, are you going to -- when do we cycle that change in the Mass piece? Can you just remind us when that is?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, it was about an $8 million impact to the quarter, so not so big, not so big anymore. And on the second half, just to carry through with that in the second half, last year, we had about $20 million of revenues associated with that Mass Jeans business that we've now exited. So $8 million in the second quarter and $20 million for the last part of the year, and then that will be done.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "Just a follow-up on Todd's question: Have you seen, Karl Heinz, any change in trend over last couple of months, given all the headlines? We've heard kind of mixed things about Europe. Just wondering if you've seen any deceleration in your European business. And secondly, just curious what's driving the turnaround in Nautica, which obviously showed some major improvement.", "Karl Salzburger", "The first question, David, we clearly stay very cautious because a lot of rumors and a lot of facts are going around Europe. The economy of certain countries are not in the best shape. So we do remain cautious. Especially in our stronger brands, we have not seen negative stigmas. Our cancellation rate has not changed, and I would say that the strong brands are doing well. While we stay cautious, we're pretty confident and don't expect negative effects happening the second semester.", "Eric Wiseman", "David, this is Eric. I'll deal with the Nautica turnaround. We're obviously thrilled that Nautica has had a really strong wholesale business in the first half. The team there has worked very hard over the last 18 months to get the right product assortment together, to get the right marketing communication message together and to get the right -- to get that to come to life that retail with our retail partners in the right way, and that's kind of firing on all cylinders right now. So they've had a good the first half, and the business is turning more pure into their traditional wholesale department store channels, so that's all really, really good for us. The outlet stores there, I will tell you, have not done as well, nor have they been our focus. Our priority was rebuild the platform for the wholesale business. Once done, leverage that into our outlet store model, so we're working on the second phase of that and I would expect to see improvement in our outlet store business there next year.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research", "I mean, are retailers now, given the turnaround this spring, certain to chase product for fall and increase their bookings on a relative basis for spring?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, I would say that our fall bookings, which are the ones that -- fall and holiday, which are the ones we have in hand, are significantly higher than -- what we assume today would be back in January and February before we began to get some momentum in the business. So our customers are increasing their support of the brand based on the performance this spring for fall and holiday. We don't have spring bookings yet, so I can't comment on that.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detail on the growth driver outlook for North Face the way you did with Vans, meaning can you give us a little color on how wholesale versus retail looks for The North Face in apparel versus footwear versus accessories sort of aligned by U.S. versus Europe versus Asia, just to give us a flavor if anything's changing in terms of what the growth drivers look like for the overall brand?", "Robert Shearer", "Robbie, I'll start on that. I gave some numbers for Vans relative to the breakout of retail versus wholesale, and it's very much a similar story for The North Face. As a matter fact, even more so; nearly all of the growth in The North Face that we've been seeing is due to the wholesale side of the business, not so much driven by new stores. And also, from an international versus U.S. standpoint, as we've been seeing and as we've been saying and as we look forward as well, the brand is strong. The brand is strong here in the U.S., it's strong Europe and it's also strong in Asia as well. So we're seeing really equal strength, equal growth. We said previously that order positions for the fall business being up, the 20% area again, that was, we saw consistency across the globe relative to those positions. So that's again, it's good news from all angles.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And any sort of category color as footwear is starting to really accelerate, or is it sort of apparel and footwear and accessories all moving together?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'd say mostly moving together. Our footwear business is still -- the resurgence, I guess I'd say of our footwear business is still in some early stages as we've talked about in the past, but the areas that have shown strength and particularly on the apparel side continue to show strength. Not a big change there.", "Operator", "And our next question from Ken Stumphauzer with Sterne Agee.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just briefly on the direct-to-consumer segment, there was a pretty noticeable deceleration in the year-over-year growth rate. What's causing that? Is it slower year-over-year increase in stores?", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, two things really. First, our comp store growth rate for the first quarter was 10%, and when that happened, we said in our first quarter call we did not expect to see that going forward. What we learned in the second quarter was that it was slightly worse than we thought it was going to be. We knew it would slow down from that kind of rate. In fact, in the second quarter, our comp store growth rate was about flat, and it just tailed off in the last six weeks of the quarter. Our outlook for the year also came down by about 100 basis points in terms of our assumption about comp store growth. which we said would be mid-single digits, and we're down about 100 basis points from what we thought sooner. We've been opening new stores and closing stores. I'm getting our mix to a position where we have a much more effective retail portfolio and it's showing up in improved profitability in our stores. So while we have some comp store pressure from consumer spending, which I think we're not alone with, the profitably of our direct-to-consumer model continues to improve because we're getting the store mix right and exiting the underperforming stores and investing in new stores, and are still on track to open about 80 new stores this year.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay. Secondly, Bob, in the past, you've disclosed kind of the order of magnitude of the different gross profit margin puts and takes. Can you do that again? What comprised that 370 basis point expansion?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, in the second quarter, and as we've been talking about here, a different story than what we expect to see for the rest of the year because of the comparisons of the second half of the year against the second half of last year. So product costs, the reduction in product costs added about 200 basis points to the 320. Eric just talked about, and this is on gross margins, Eric just talked about our retail performance, and that has improved, and that contributed about 70 basis points. And just operating the business really cleanly and other mix factors and all those other kinds of things made up the difference.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay. I know you can't talk in specifics, but as far as the M&A environment goes, we've obviously seen a lot of volatility in the equity markets and perhaps some concerns in the credit markets. I'm just wondering if you're seeing perhaps valuations come down to more reasonable levels yet.", "Eric Wiseman", "I wish I could say that was the case. I think that has not been -- we have not gotten an acquisition done this year, so that's blinding flash of the obvious. Having said that, one of the reasons has been price. We have not been able to come to terms with the price that the sellers expect, and we don't have anything that I have as a reference point. But clearly, the markets have come down, and that might suggest a different kind of valuation. We remain focused as we have been on the Outdoor and Action Sports sectors as our primary focus for acquisitions, and we're still very active.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "First on the gross margins, when you look at your outlook for the back half of the year, you guys are saying gross margins are up and product costs down. But, Bob, you made a comment that you should actually see some product cost increases in the fourth quarter. So do you expect gross margins to be up in the fourth quarter? Or is it more just the third quarter? Or how should we be thinking about between the two quarters?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, it a little bit more improvement just as you expect, Mitch, with costs, what's happening with costs. And again, it's not a huge impact here, but yes, we see expect to see the comparison a little stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter -- versus the fourth quarter last year that was really an extraordinary quarter for us. So yes, clearly a little more improvement, yes, in the third than the fourth.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "But you still think gross margin could be up in the fourth quarter even within...", "Robert Shearer", "Possibly yes, slightly, but flat to up very slightly.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. And then on the SG&A, Bob, you mentioned that if you strip out your higher investments in the back half, you actually expect leverage on that line item, which is pretty impressive I think given that what's happening with mix, particularly as you build out your retail business. So I guess the question is on a longer-term basis, how should we be thinking about that SG&A line? I mean, is that something where you can get leverage over the next few years? Is that how you're thinking about the business on a go-forward basis?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, I'd say relative to SG&A, Mitch, that a lot does depend on our spending, on the marketing spend. And you're right; what we're seeing this year is that the big factor is, in fact, the higher and the incremental marketing spend. Now to be fair, one of the points of leverage, you could say, but our lower pension expense is helping us there. So that accounts for some of the difference, but still otherwise, relatively flat. So I think a lot of that will depend on the marketing spend, and that's yet to be seen. If our marketing continues to -- the higher spend continues to produce the results that we're seeing, we may continue to accelerate the spend.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I guess one of my questions is just on if you can talk about 7 for a moment and just, Eric, your comment about just kind of what you're seeing in that business. Maybe talk about retail and the wholesale pieces and just in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of the business.", "Eric Wiseman", "That one shifted on us a little bit here in the quarter. We had a really strong first quarter with 7. We had a strong second quarter with 7 as well. We have seen a slowdown in the premium denim space in the last few weeks -- in the last eight weeks, really, since May. That segment in particular has been a soft spot, so our stores are still working for us, and we're continuing to invest in our stores, but there clearly has been a slowdown. How long that lasts, I wish I knew the answer to that. The answer for us is to make sure we create compelling product, which obviously we're working on that, and we're increasing our investment in the brand. In fact, we're just about doubling our marketing spend behind 7 For All Mankind right now because we think it's a great brand. And even though it's under pressure right now, we're going to spend on it to make sure that we connect with consumers in the right way. We underspent on it a bit in the last few years, so we're going to reinvest in it and hope we have the right products at the time and that the fall gets better than the last eight weeks have been.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "As you think about the Contemporary business, even beyond 7, what are you seeing in terms of price points, department store contribution for in-store shops? How is that moving along and their ordering trends? And just lastly, not just to beat the dead horse in terms of product costs, as you think about 2011, do you see price points to consumers changing?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. In the contemporary space, in terms of price points, there was a significant reduction in price points during the course of the recession over a two-year period. The average price point for a pair of premium jeans, regardless of brand, came down. It didn't mean that we didn't still offer the high end of the range, but the consumers bought more at the lower end of the range, so we saw a reduction in AURs. That stabilized in the first four months of this year, and I think it's under question right now, Dana, because there's been a change that really has just happened, and as you know, we're also at a period of year, it's been a very warm June and July across the United States, and I'm not sure if people are waking up thinking I'm going to go buy a pair of long jeans, long bottom jeans right now because that's what I want to wear today. In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't. The question will be during back-to-school: Does that come back and what does that mean to the average unit retails? Your question about 2011, I wrote 2011 on my pad and I can't remember your question. Was it about pricing? I think we're going to see some modest increase in price points across many apparel brands, including ours, to offset some of the inflation we're seeing. And the inflation is real; the labor rate and the cotton inflation, that's real. And I think were going to see every apparel company try to figure out how to deal with that, including reflecting some of that in their pricing to consumers.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question today from Kevin Boler [ph] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Bob, you've taken a couple questions today on M&A and I think in particular, you're saying that some of the targets are maybe asking too much here. So I think in March, you'd mentioned that you'd be willing to make $1 billion-plus acquisition if you could find the right target. I'm curious if you're still thinking that $1 billion-plus is a good number and just what your constraints are. I mean, how do you think about your capital structure? Is leverage now close to one turn? Is three or four turns too much leverage for the right acquisition, for a $2 billion or $3 billion or $4 billion acquisition? I'm just curious, what are the constraints to how you think about capital structure? And how low do you want to keep leverage? And how do you think about the big pictures cap structure questions as you think about M&A?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, Kevin [ph], we do talk about a billion-dollar deal because we could clearly afford to do that, and that's really where the comments are coming from, so we often get the question would you, could you do a billion-dollar deal, and we say, well, we certainly could. And we would for the right brand. All the risk factors would have to be appropriate to do the billion-dollar deal, but we would do a billion-dollar deal. So when you look at our debt ratios right now and our cash position as well, it obviously gives us a lot of flexibility. We talked a little bit earlier, don't know if you heard it, there was a question relative to the buyback program. We upped the buyback a bit here in the quarter over what was expected. We bought back 4 million shares versus the 3 million expected, said we could increase that a bit as our cash continues to strengthen. So I think the bottom line, Kevin [ph], is we just have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet right now from a cash, from a debt standpoint, and the priority remains on acquisition. And we could do a larger acquisition. If you looked at our history, it would say that that's not as likely as one that's below that billion-dollar mark.", "Operator", "And that was our last question. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We're obviously pleased with the second quarter. That is history now. More importantly, we're confident we can navigate the challenges ahead of us, and we look forward to keeping you updated as we do just that. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana. Please go ahead.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in VF Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Conference Call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If you have not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we will send you a copy immediately following the call.", "Hosting the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.", "Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations or financial conditions of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC. I would like to now turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our three Group Presidents, Scott Baxter; Karl Heinz Salzburger, who is joining us from Lugano, Switzerland; and Steve Rendle, who is joining us on the line from California. ", "I'm delighted to share with you today the record results achieved by VF in 2010 and our expectations for even stronger performance this year. A year ago at this time, with the world struggling to emerge from the recession, we view the outlook for 2010 cautiously and we planned accordingly. The plans we put in place and build upon as the year progressed yielded results far surpassing our expectations. ", "Consider the highlights of VF's performance in the fourth quarter and for 2010. Organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter and 6% for the year; double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share of 10% and 15%, respectively; record gross margins in both periods; growth in international revenues in constant dollars of 22% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, closing Asia, which has been a strategic priority for us of 31% in both the quarter and the year; growth in our direct-to-consumer revenues of 13% for both periods; cash from operations of $1 billion, another record; and additional brand building investment of $100 million in 2010 with nearly half taking place in the fourth quarter. So we enter 2011 with strong momentum, confident in the power of our brands' ability to generate substantial growth and well positioned to deliver another outstanding year of results for our shareholders.", "As noted in our release in 2011, revenues are expected to grow by 8% to 9%, with growth across all coalitions. Earnings per share are expected to reach a new high in the $7 to $7.10 range. Operating margins should remain stable despite industry-wide cost inflation. Our highly profitable international and direct-to-consumer businesses should grow at mid-teen rates. And cash from operations will again be at the $1 billion level. And based on the momentum created by our brand investments in 2010, 2011 will be another year of very healthy brand spending.", "Before I turn it over to Bob, who will provide more commentary on the subject, I'll share a few words on the question of product cost and gross margins. We indicated in our release that gross margin should be down by less than 1 percentage point, reflecting higher product cost that are expected to primarily impact our domestic Jeanswear business, which accounts for slightly more than 20% of VF's revenues. Our Jeanswear operating margins will be down this year, but margins in the other nearly 80% of our business are expected to be flat to up slightly. ", "As we noted during the past few months, select price increases will be taken across our brand portfolio to help offset product cost inflation. We're aware that we are entering a new environment here in terms of consumer reaction to broadly higher apparel prices and that some trade-off in unit volumes is likely. I'm confident that our plans for 2011 take that into account. ", "In closing, we believe we have the most competitive business model in the industry, giving us confidence in our ability to continue the momentum established in the latter part of 2010 and navigating through the challenges and uncertainties created by cost inflation. On the one hand, we have our internal manufacturing capabilities largely in this hemisphere where we enjoy a decades-long history of manufacturing and engineering expertise and many cost and service advantages. And on the other hand, we enjoy a highly diversified and balanced base of contractors managed from one of the largest sourcing offices in Hong Kong, which provides us with tremendous scale and expertise. We can adjust our sourcing strategies fairly quickly given the strength of our global supply chain to ensure we're taking advantage of the best value in the market at any point in time. ", "So with that as a backdrop, let's hear more details from Bob Shearer.", "Robert Shearer", "All right. Well, thanks, Eric. First, I'll highlight a couple of points related to 2010. Our changing business mix helped drive gross margins in 2010 and will continue to benefit 2011 as well. Gross margins in 2010 expanded by 240 basis points. Now, of that total, 130 basis points of improvement resulted from first, a higher percentage of our revenues coming from businesses that provide us with higher gross margins, and secondly, other areas of operational improvements, including retail and inventory efficiencies. The remainder of our gross margin expansion, or 110 basis points, resulted from product cost reductions.", "SG&A in both dollars and as a percent of revenues increased in the fourth quarter and for the year, driven largely by significant increases in brand investments. As noted in the release, the fourth quarter marked the highest period of brand investment for us during the year, with $45 million out of a total $100 million in additional spending occurring in the quarter. This increase, being so heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, reflects the momentum we saw as our year progressed. That impacted the timing of decisions related to the higher spend. Going forward, our marketing investments will be more balanced throughout the year.", "So considering this disproportionally high level of marketing spend in the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, operating margins were down slightly in the quarter. For the year, adjusted operating margins rose by 140 basis points to 13.3% from 11.9% last year.", "Now, as Eric noted, on an adjusted basis, that is excluding the impairment charge, we were very pleased to report record earnings for both the fourth quarter and the year. The strength of our earnings reflects strong business fundamentals. We invested more behind our strongest growing brands and geographies providing accelerating growth in revenues and earnings. ", "And finally, on a reported basis, fourth quarter and full year results were impacted by an impairment charge for our 7 For All Mankind brand acquired in 2007. As you're well aware, conditions in the premium denim market have been quite difficult since the beginning of the recession, and the performance of the 7 For All Mankind brand has not met the expectations we established at the time of acquisition. However, the brand has continued to expand globally, with considerably stronger growth rates outside of the U.S. We doubled our investments behind the brand in 2010 to further solidify its platform for future growth. That platform includes additional direct-to-consumer expansion, continued growth in international markets and brand extensions into additional product categories. We're looking forward to improve top and bottom line performance for the 7 For All Mankind brand in 2011.", "Now before we move in to our review of our business results by Karl Heinz, Steve and Scott, I'll provide a few additional comments on revenues, pricing, costs and margins. Revenues in 2011 should increase 8% to 9%, and we expect fairly comparable revenue increases in each of the next four quarters. By coalition, revenue growth will be strongest in Outdoor & Action Sports where we continue to see tremendous momentum. We expect Outdoor & Action Sports revenues to grow at a mid-teen percentage rate. Our Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary coalitions are each planning for mid-single digit revenue growth in 2011. ", "Now regarding pricing. Selected price increases will be taken primarily in those businesses where higher product costs, cotton in particular, are having the biggest impact. That includes our U.S. Jeanswear businesses and to a lesser degree, our Sportswear and Imagewear businesses as well. Modest and selected price increases are also anticipated in our other coalitions. These price increases will be phased in throughout the year, more in the second half than in the first, given that product costs will be higher in the second half than in the first.", "Price increases and other factors positive to our gross margin comparisons will not entirely offset the pressure from higher product costs. In 2011, VF's overall product cost will be up roughly 7%, driven primarily by the well-documented and unprecedented increase in cotton prices. Now as you would imagine, that means that our area with the most cost pressure is our Jeanswear business and specifically, our U.S. Jeans business, which competes in channels where price points and product costs are lower. The impact of cotton cost increases stands out more on these lower-cost products. A little more perspective. Our U.S. Jeans business is just about 20% of total VF revenues. For these jeans products, costs are expected to rise by mid-teen percentages for the full year with higher cost increases in the second half than the first.", "Our unit volume increases for our U.S. Jeans businesses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were quite strong, up nearly 9%, reflecting strong momentum for these brands. Now while price increases will partly offset higher costs, gross margins for these businesses in 2011 will come down from 2010 by over 350 basis points. Recently, our visibility to denim costs for the year has improved significantly. ", "First, a reminder that we buy denim, not cotton. And even though spot prices for cotton are nearly incredible price of $2 a pound, the mills that supply us denim don't buy on the spot market. They participate in the cotton market on an ongoing basis. Now the change that has occurred is that many denim mills are now committing to prices through the third quarter and some through the entire year. Another reminder is that our denim buys past the third quarter will flow through cost of sales in 2012, just as purchases in the latter part of 2010 will impact cost of sales in the early 2011 period. So our visibility to denim cost is improving, and that is giving us considerable confidence in our assumptions around product costs for the year. ", "In summary, we believe we have taken a responsible approach to planning our U.S. Jeans business considering cost pressures, pricing opportunities and the impact of higher prices on ultimate consumer take out at retail. So our U.S. Jeans businesses will experience the biggest impact from product cost increases. However, despite the more than 350 basis point reduction expected in U.S. Jeans gross margins in 2011, our global Jeanswear operating margins for 2011 are expected to decline by less than 100 basis points based on the following: first, we'll see continued improvement within our European Jeans business. Our European Jeans business is seeing some traction. After a couple of years of decline, our cost structure is improved, our inventories are cleaner and we're in the position to move forward with much improved profitability. ", "Also important to our global Jeanswear operating margin expectation is the continuation of exceptional growth in our highly profitable Asian Jeans business. Our Asian Jeans business is becoming a bigger piece of our global Jeanswear picture. With that growth, the international portion of global jeans now represents nearly 1/3 of the total. ", "So to pull all this together, Eric noted that the full year gross margins are likely to be down by just under 1 percentage point. Just to be clear here, higher product costs are a significant downward pressure but are being offset by the continuing favorable change in business mix and finally, selective price increases. ", "And that brings us to our anticipated SG&A spending level. Our guidance indicated that operating margins for total VF should remain relatively stable in 2011. Considering the lower gross margin expectation, that implies that as a percent of revenues, SG&A should be nearly a full point lower than 2010's ratio of 33.4%. ", "Now here's our approach to SG&A spending in 2011. We will continue to invest in marketing at the same rate, meaning at the same percent of revenues as the elevated level in 2010. Our marketing investments have proven very effective in driving revenues and equity in our brands. ", "In other expense categories, we've been very cautious about adding expense to our structure, making tough decisions to control costs. So leveraging the top line, spending prudently behind our brands and driving efficiencies elsewhere is the story here. ", "With regard to our higher marketing spend, these investments will continue to be concentrated in our fastest growing and most profitable businesses. For example, marketing investments in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition will increase by about 15% in 2011, and in Asia, will rise by over 30%. These investments have driven both top and bottom line growth as evidenced by the strong profitability of these businesses in 2010, and we look forward to continuing that momentum in 2011.", "Okay, now shifting gears a bit. We expect another year where our cash generation hits the $1 billion mark. Our strong cash generation in 2010 allowed us to pay down $200 million in higher cost debt, buy back over 5 million of our shares and invest $100 million in our pension plan which is now nearly fully funded. ", "Looking forward, our priorities for cash remain intact. Acquisitions remain at the top of the list, with our buyback program remaining a secondary option. We have no debt due until 2017. ", "And to get in front of a few likely questions, our capital spend will move a bit higher in 2011 to about $225 million, reflecting the need for office and distribution space for our expanding international and U.S. Outdoor businesses, as well as an accelerated retail store opening plan. Depreciation and amortization should remain very consistent with the 2010 level at about $175 million. ", "So in summary, here's how I see the year 2011 shaping up. First, the momentum coming out of 2010 is relevant. Investments behind our brands, which accelerated during the latter half of 2010, have been and will continue to pay off, and we'll see that momentum continue into 2011. We're dealing head-on with the challenge of rising product costs, which are clearly most prominent for our U.S. Jeanswear business. Our portfolio approach provides us with a clear advantage in addressing these challenges, and we have prudently built our plans to not only address the cost issue but respond appropriately in pricing and revenue volume assumptions for 2011 and beyond. We've successfully navigated through challenging environments in the past. We will do so again in 2011. I have no doubt that 2011 will be another great year for VF and for our shareholders. ", "So now let's hear a few words from Scott Baxter on our Jeanswear Americas and Imagewear results and outlook.", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning. I'll start with an overview of the highlights for the fourth quarter and for the year for our Jeanswear Americas business, which includes our Wrangler, Lee and Riders by Lee brands. ", "We ended the year on a strong note, with revenues up across our businesses in the quarter. We have been aggressively building our innovation platform with investments in new skills, new talents and new processes that are fueling top line growth and market share gains across our flagship brands. At the same time, we maintained operating margins in the high teens despite some higher product cost and marketing investments. ", "Overall, 2010 was a great year for Jeanswear Americas, with higher revenues and operating income. All brands gained share relative to the market and to their primary national competitors. ", "In our mass business, the Wrangler and Riders by Lee brands gained momentum throughout the year in both the U.S. and Mexico. New distribution in Mexico and innovative new products, such as our Comfort Series in men's and our classic fit, slender stretch and plus size programs in women's, led to higher revenues in 2010 compared with 2009. Innovation was also the major story behind our growth in our Lee brand in 2010, which grew its businesses across all major accounts. ", "During the year, we successfully launched our new Lee Premium Select line in men's and the new Lee Classic Fit in women's. We were very excited about the performance of our Lee Women's business, which outpaced market growth in its mid-tier distribution channels by 2:1. ", "We are proud to report that revenues in our Wrangler Western Specialty business grew in 2010 for the first time in several years, beating our expectations. Here, too, product innovation played a key role with the successful launch of our new Premium Performance Cowboy Cut Jean, growing momentum in our Retro line and the success of our new Rock 47 line targeted toward a younger, more fashionable Western consumer. ", "In October we opened our first company-owned retail store outside of Denver, Colorado, which will serve as a learning lab for how to maximize the brand's rich, authentic history within its Western Specialty channel. South of the border, our Mexican and Latin American businesses experienced strong top line growth in 2010 with revenues up 17%. ", "In terms of 2011 for our Jeanswear America businesses, we anticipate mid-single digit growth in revenues. At the same time, unit volumes are expected to decline at a mid-single digit rate, offset by some new programs and pricing. We will build on our product innovation successes to expand on our share with our key retail partners. We will continue to support our brands with strong and effective advertising using marketing ROI tools to significantly raise our game in how and where we invest our marketing dollars, and we will continue to enhance our brand's digital and social media capabilities to drive online sales and forge even stronger connections with our consumers. ", "We entered 2011 with our key brands as strong and well positioned for growth as they have ever been. But as you've heard, we also entered 2011 facing significant product cost challenges related primarily to the sharp rise in cotton prices over the year. So this will also be a year in which we must strategically navigate price increases across our retail customer base, ensuring that we maximize operating profits while still maintaining or growing our market shares. ", "And clearly, we have looked at every possible opportunity to mitigate cost pressures this year and pricing as part of that equation. Some initial price increases have taken effect in February, with some additional increases planned as the year progresses. On the cost side, we're keeping a tight rein on expenses and reengineering products. Our efforts are focused on maximizing margins in the short term while continuing to build share over the long term. ", "Nevertheless, the combination of pricing and cost controls does not fully mitigate the increases in product costs, and as noted earlier by Bob, our domestic Jeanswear margins will be down this year. That is built into the expectation that the global Jeanswear coalition operating margins will decline by less than 100 basis points for 2011. ", "In closing, we remain bullish about the long-term prospects for our very strong brands. The product cost challenges we face are being faced by other companies as well, and we are confident in our ability to successfully navigate our way through these challenges. We have a talented, aggressive, experienced team with a track record of winning in any environment, and this year will be no exception. ", "Now, I'd like to shift gears and talk about the great quarter and year achieved by our Imagewear coalition. As we stated in our press release, Imagewear coalition revenues grew 5% in the quarter with particular strength in our protective business with the Bulwark brand. Operating margins in the quarter rose nearly a full percentage point to 12.7% as compared to 11.7% in last year's fourth quarter, and operating income increased by 27% in 2010. It was clearly a turnaround year for the Image business, with revenues up 8% driven by strength in our protective and industrial businesses. Here, we benefited from a strong relationship with key accounts, and our service model enabled us to capitalize on uniform replenishment opportunities throughout the year despite the continued challenges posed by the economic conditions and sustained high levels of unemployment. ", "Our Licensed Sports group, or LSG, grew sales 3% with market share gains with our key retail partners as we leverage our best-in-class slow replenishment model to quickly get the right products on the retail floor at the right times. ", "During 2010, we also strengthened our foundation for the future. In highly competitive bidding, we extended our NFL rights including new international rights. We also created a new college fan wear business model with co-exclusivity in channels and categories, our LSG strengths. We have signed fan wear deals with seven leading schools for shipments starting this summer giving us a new growth platform. ", "In terms of 2011, we remain confident that we can maintain the positive momentum in both businesses. We are targeting a mid-single digit growth rate for Imagewear coalition revenues this year. We're also looking forward to higher operating income and margins. While we're not counting on much improvement in employment rates, we expect to sustain solid momentum in our Image division in 2011 based on two primary factors. First, the fundamentals in the protective apparel market remain solid with continued domestic oil and gas exploration expected to increase as gasoline prices rise. Second, our value proposition to the laundry channel is key in this market environment. In addition to benefiting from our service model, we've also seen that some of our partners are seeing the downside of the cost, complexity and risk of running an internal supply chain, which points to additional growth opportunities for us. And for our LSG division, retailers are entering 2011 with leaner inventories setting a table for our Licensed Sports business to once again capture in-season replenishment business. We now have a number of new innovative product initiatives in the pipeline and are looking forward to a year of solid growth here. ", "Next, we have Steve Rendle with us to recap the strong results in our Outdoor & Action Sports Americas business.", "Steve Rendle", "Thank you, Scott. As noted in the press release, revenues in our Americas business increased 17% in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in both The North Face and Vans. ", "For the full year, the Outdoor & Action Sports Americas revenue grew by 16.5%, with solid growth achieved in each of our brands, The North Face, Vans, JanSport, lucy, Reef and Eagle Creek. ", "At our recent The North Face investor meeting, we talked about unique connection The North Face brand has with its consumers as the number one authentic and technically innovative outdoor brand, both in the U.S. and globally. To further strengthen that connection, in the fourth quarter, we invested heavily behind the brand, focusing on targeted TV, online and in-store marketing campaigns. These investments helped us drive strong sell-through across all channels of the business. ", "In the direct-to-consumer side, we saw high single digit comp store growth and exceptional growth in our e-commerce business. The North Face carries a significant amount of momentum into 2011, and we will remain focused on the four key initiatives we spoke about during our December analyst meeting: executing against our activity-based model with product innovation to deliver technically superior and relevant product to specific consumer activities of outdoor, performance and action sports; delivering an exceptional brand experience across all aspects of our direct-to-consumer platform to help drive brand awareness, equity and revenue both in-store and online; driving our sustainability and outdoor participation initiatives; and further investing behind an authentic brand building marketing platform to increase both brand awareness, while driving traffic to the brand's wholesale partner doors across the globe.", "The North Face brand continues to exhibit strength with spring bookings in the Americas up 17%. Looking ahead, a strong platform is in place to deliver The North Face brand growth in 2011 and beyond. During our December investor meeting, we noted that the brand continues to have a tremendous runway for growth, and we are targeting a five-year compounded growth rate of 16% and a global revenue goal of $3 billion.", "At Vans, fourth quarter and full year results also benefited from higher brand investment. In December, vans.com received a record-breaking number of unique visitors and the brand's Facebook fans grew by more than fivefold to 1.8 million, helping drive solid year-over-year comps in both the bricks and mortar and e-commerce store fronts. Vans growth continues to be very well balanced with growth being uniform across both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels for both the fourth quarter and full year. ", "For 2011, our efforts will continue to be focused on growing awareness and accessibility for the brand outside its core California market. To that end, one of this year's primary initiatives will be able to further activate the Vans brand throughout the New York City metro area and to use this platform to build visibility across the East Coast region. ", "As a start, in October of last year, we opened our new House of Vans Event Space in Brooklyn, New York with an opening event that drew an audience of over 900 brand enthusiasts. We'll build on this buzz with the opening of new retail stores, engaging with the highly influential consumers, industry and media with the House of Vans venue and deploying grassroot marketing, digital and social media campaigns. ", "Building our brand platform in Mexico will also be a key initiative following last year's acquisition of our joint venture partner. 2011 looks to be off to a strong start for Vans, with global spring bookings up in the low to mid-teens. ", "2010 was a turnaround year for lucy, with revenues up 16% built on high double-digit comp increases in both our stores and e-commerce platform. Our new product introductions are resonating extremely well with the consumers with standout success in our Perfect Core Pant and our semi-reversible vests in particular. ", "We are refining best practices and processes around the new leadership team, which is now relocated from Portland, Oregon to Alameda, California. This new team is developing aggressive plans for future growth. ", "This year we're looking forward to double-digit growth in our lucy brand. We'll be introducing updated branding elements for the lucy brand while also taking steps to enhance consumer web experience with improved navigation and brand story telling. For our 65 retail stores, we've redefined our store model, and we'll be utilizing ethnographic research to identify new market expansion opportunities. ", "Our other brands in the Americas, JanSport, Eagle Creek and Reef brands are also planning for double-digit growth. ", "In summary, we have great brands and talented teams focused on sustaining our momentum and delivering another outstanding year in 2011. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to my colleague, Karl Heinz Salzburger.", "Karl Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve. Let me begin by reiterating some highlights for the quarter and for the year specific to our international businesses in Europe and Asia.", "Strong fourth quarter performance in Europe was driven by our Outdoor & Action Sports business where revenue grew by 35% on a constant-currency basis, as well as our Sportswear and Contemporary business where revenue grew 22% on a constant-currency basis. For the full year, revenue grew 17% and 4% respectively for those two businesses. ", "Our European Jeanswear business continues to stabilize. Excluding the exit of our mass market business in Europe, revenues reflect on a constant-currency basis in the fourth quarter and profitability continues to show a significant improvement. Our direct-to-consumer initiatives continue to drive growth in Europe with The North Face and Vans each delivering double-digit comp store sales gains in our full-price stores in the fourth quarter. ", "We also achieved solid comp store sales increases in our Napapijri, Kipling and 7 For All Mankind brands during the quarter. For the full year, The North Face comp store sales were up 30%; Vans, 19%; and Napapijri was up 9%. ", "Asia continues to be an important growth market. It is worth repeating here that our revenues in Asia were up 31% in both the fourth quarter and full year. Our four primary platforms are firmly established, in Jeanswear with Lee and Wrangler, Outdoor with The North Face, Action Sports with Vans and Sportswear and Accessories with Kipling. Each of these businesses continues to have tremendous opportunities for future growth, and we are investing accordingly. ", "During '10, total brand investment in China doubled '09 levels, and we plan an increase of over 30% in '11. India has emerged as another big, highly profitable growth market for us. We established a majority on joint venture during '06, and our business has accelerated dramatically with revenues doubling in the fourth quarter and up 60% for the year.", "Several strategic initiatives are in place for 2011 to drive continued momentum across our brands and geographies. First is Europe, which represents about 60% of total international revenues. We expect continued momentum here with strong forward bookings and double-digit increases planned in most brands.", "An important factor in our strong growth expectations for Europe is the continued growth in both revenues and profitability of our direct-to-consumer business. We are very encouraged by the significant improvement that we achieved in our overall profitability in '10, which places us in a great position to accelerate our store openings this year. ", "In 2011, we plan to grow our store base by 25%, focused on prime locations that align with our brands' image. Store openings will be concentrated in The North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind brands. ", "Thirdly, in Asia, we will build upon our current strong momentum, increasing our marketing investments, expanding our door count and strengthening our leadership team and infrastructure. Our door count in China should grow by over 500 with an emphasis on Vans, which will double its distribution. In India, we will be adding 125 stores through partners, which will bring our total to over 700 partner doors there, and look forward to launching Vans as well. ", "We are looking forward to another year of strong growth in Asia with revenues expected to rise by over 25% from a base of $385 million in '10. We have our eyes fixed firmly on achieving our longer term revenue target of $1 billion. ", "And lastly, having strengthened our platform in '10, we will continue to improve the fundamentals and invest in growing our European Jeanswear business. We have accelerated product innovation in both our Wrangler and Lee brands. We will move forward with distinctive marketing campaigns to ensure our brand story reaches consumers across all touch points. With a turnaround in profitability achieved in '10, we feel increasingly confident about the prospect for expanding our Jeanswear business. ", "Overall, we are very pleased with our accomplishment in '10, and 2011 is off to a tremendous start. We have many strategic initiatives in place and a strong platform to support our growth across all businesses in 2011 and beyond.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. Before we open the lines for questions, I'd like to remind everyone that we have an investor meeting planned for March 11 in New York City. We look forward to updating you on our five-year plans and targets at that time. And with that, we'll open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "The first one on the revenue guidance, I think it's 8% to 9% for 2011. Can you give us sort of the aggregate amount of that price increase that's baked into that? And then the second kind of broader question is -- I thought you guys laid out a lot already on how you get to $7 to $7.10 for the year. You guys are usually conservative I think. So can you sort of give us some of the things that you think where you most likely could see upside to the 2011 guidance that you guys gave us this morning?", "Robert Shearer", "Robbie, this is Bob. I'll start on the pricing piece. There's a few percentage worth of pricing. Of the 8% to 9%, again, a few percentage points are represented by pricing. What I'd also point out, that a couple of other factors is that in our Jeanswear business as you imagine where the most cost pressure is felt, that's where we see the most pricing opportunity. However, what I'd also say is that our Jeanswear business, as Scott mentioned in his commentary, also includes a decline actually in unit volumes. So there are a lot of different factors impacting the overall revenue guidance. But yes, a few percentage points come specifically from pricing, and as we pointed out, very selective pricing increases, and of course, Jeanswear being the most significant component of the pricing. A little pricing increases in most of the business across the businesses, but not nearly to the impact that we see in Jeanswear.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then where the opportunity might be to do better than the sort of initial guidance you guys laid out for 2011?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, what I'd say to that is, again, I know we're spending a lot of time talking about the Jeanswear business. But we hope, clearly, that we've captured the impact of the higher price points. And we think we've been prudent in terms of how we've dealt with that in terms of the volume declines that we specifically mentioned. I think one of the points there, Robbie, is that we have an advantage from a cost standpoint in jeans. As the Asian markets are a little sketchy in terms of getting product and that kind of thing, you know that in our U.S. jeans business, 65% of those products come from our own plants. And while others are dealing with cost increases from labor as well as fabrics, in our own plants, we believe that our cost from a labor standpoint will be neutral. And the reason for that is the benefit that we see by putting products through our own plants is broadening. It's bigger than it has been ever before because of what's going on in the world of sourcing. So what we're doing is we're bringing more products into our own plants with the flat labor costs to us because of the higher absorption, and we think that's a real advantage to us. So while everyone and all of our competitors are going to be feeling the pressures of cost and pricing as well, we believe that we're advantaged there. So it's a little hard to tell exactly how all that's going to sort out given the pricing and volume ratios. Again, we think that we've prudently captured that, and hopefully, we have.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Is there any thought on just how we should lay out our quarters? Do you think the rate of earnings growth will be pretty consistent over the next four quarters based on your 2011 outlook?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, the quarters that you'll see the most impact, specifically from the gross margin side, will be the second and third. As you know, the costs that we carried into the year from 2010 were lower. And as a matter fact, in our Jeanswear business, using that as an example, what we did was we bought more denim. We bought 50% more denim to carry into 2011 than we normally would, obviously, in anticipation of the higher costs. So the first quarter comparisons as you would imagine would be a little bit better and the second and third quarters are where the cost increases will be most obvious. Now you might be wondering why not the fourth quarter? And the reason for that is in the fourth quarter of 2010, we began to see the impacts of higher cost, specifically in our Jeanswear business. Our operating margins actually just in our U.S. jeans business, again where the most pressure is, were down a couple of hundred basis points in the fourth quarter. Now not really that noticeable because of the improvements that we saw in other pieces of our business, specifically European jeans business, as well as our Asian jeans business. And that's exactly what we expect to see in the fourth quarter of 2011 as I mentioned in my comments. So not quite as much pressure in terms of the comparisons in the fourth quarter. A little more in the second and third quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies", "In terms of pricing, domestic versus international, I'm wondering if you could share a little bit more detail there. Understand you go for some strategic price increases in your domestic denim business. Will that carry over into Europe and Asia? And to what extent are you seeing other opportunities for strategic price adjustments across the kind of three major regions? And then one other question, Bob, for you is on FX, kind of what are your thoughts for FX going into 2011? What are you planning, what rates are you planning at?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll deal with the first part of that and let Bob deal with the second part. We are having product cost increases across the globe, but it means different things to different business units. On the domestic front where we are so heavily penetrated, particularly in our Jeanswear business in the mass and mid-tier, an increase in cost of denim has a much more severe inflationary impact on our pricing to consumers. In Europe and in Asia, where products are so much more expensive to begin with at a base level, the percentage increase from the inflation is relatively minor and relatively easy to pass through. This is a much lower percentage of higher priced products. So we have inflation worldwide, but how it shows up in the product in the mid-tier could be mid-single digit cost increases. And in Europe, it could be a very low single digit price increase that's relatively invisible to consumers. I'll ask Bob now to deal with the FX question.", "Robert Shearer", "On the FX question we're using a $1.30 rate on the euro. Our biggest exposure, as you all know, is against the euro and we're using a $1.30, understanding that today's rate is in the $1.36 to $1.37 range. And just to put it a little bit of perspective around that, every $0.05 movement, five-point movement in the relationship is worth about, at this point in time of the year is worth about $40 million of revenues and a couple, $0.02 to $0.03 a share.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "My question is around sourcing as well. And I think you had mentioned, incorporating in your guidance is the possibility of unit decline in your Jeanswear business. And I wondered if you could tell us what elasticity rate you're assuming for your Jeanswear business. Then my second question in that, it sounds like you have some good visibility through the third quarter. When do you expect to get more visibility for cost in the fourth quarter or for the fourth quarter?", "Robert Shearer", "I'll take a stab at the elasticity question. I mean, it's a little hard to answer, Kate. I guess what I would do is repeat what we've assumed. We're clearly not offsetting all of the cost with pricing. And I mentioned that we expect the cost increases to be in the mid-teen kinds of increases, obviously higher in the second half of the year than the first half, closer to 20% actually in the second half of the year. With that, yes, we are assuming volume reductions against that. And as I said, assuming that pricing will not fully offset the cost increases, hence the 350 basis point reduction in our gross margins. I'm not really sure how to relate in terms of the elasticity. What we did was we looked at a lot of different factors from a lot of different businesses to evaluate the impact of pricing on our ultimate volumes and feel like we came to a really prudent response in terms of the assumptions that we've made around volume related to price increases.", "Eric Wiseman", "And, Kate, I'll add that we have communicated our pricing plans to our retailers. And the plans we have for spring and our plans are locked down through the fall season. We share assumptions with our retail partners about what the price increases will be and the impact on unit dollar. So we have agreement with them on what the elasticity will be, and it differs by product and style and retailer. Whether we're right or not is what we don't know, but we do have an agreement on it. They've bought units into our new prices. And Bob, did you want to deal with the visibility of fourth quarter?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, visibility of fourth quarter cost I think is what you were zeroing in on, Kate. Generally, six months in advance is what is the general rule of thumb here. So now, again, we are gaining visibility to the fourth quarter, and once again, I'll speak mostly to the Jeanswear piece. And we have, as I said in my comments, we have denim vendors that are now committing to us through the full year. So they're committing to prices that would take us through the full year. So we have some visibility already, and we'll have greater visibility in a few months from now by the end of June. One other point I did want to make, Kate, is just again, keep in mind that in the fourth quarter, now we're talking about costs that will carry into 2012. So when we buy fabric, for example, denim that we acquire in the fourth quarter will flow through cost of sales in the first quarter of 2012.", "Eric Wiseman", "Did that help you, Kate?", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "It does, yes. And if I could just ask one more question on your retail business, we did get on the international side, but of the 100 doors you're opening in 2011, can you break down what brands most of the store openings are from? And then also I wanted to know if there was any more low hanging fruit for your e-commerce business, for example, are there businesses that still need e-commerce websites in certain geographical locations and things like that you'll be addressing in 2011?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, and your question about store count is a 2011 store count or 2010?", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Yes.", "Eric Wiseman", "We plan to open around 100 stores, let me give you some context, around 100 stores next year or this year, I guess it's 2011. A big change for us in 2011 is that the mix is going to shift from being primarily domestic doors to primarily, I'd say the majority, about 60% will be opened outside of the United States, and the reason for that, Karl Heinz alluded to during the call, is the strength of the operating performance that we're now achieving in our international store. As Karl Heinz and his team have improved the operating performance of our stores, we're investing disproportionately in them, as we enable our brand portfolio around the world. As we look at stores in general, and I don't have specific numbers for you, but Vans is a big priority for us. In Asia, just in general, we're going to open up a lot of store fronts next year. 7 For All Mankind would be the next largest brand probably followed after that by Jeanswear in Asia.", "Operator", "Eric Tracy with FBR Capital Markets has our next question.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "If I could just on the gross margin levers, I guess stripping out higher product cost inflation, sort of the contribution from the manufacturing efficiencies and then the mix shift, the higher -- the lifestyle brands to direct-to-consumer international, what kind of contribution are those pieces making as we think about FY '11?", "Robert Shearer", "Eric, so the mix shift, and as you know, we've been seeing a nice benefit from the faster growth in our higher margin businesses. And that holds true for our retail business as well, much higher gross margins, expanding stronger than overall VF averages. That also holds true for our international business and that will be particularly so in 2011. As we said, we're expecting mid-teen kind of growth rates. So that 100 basis points that we've been seeing over the past couple of years of improvement in the gross margin line, we once again expect to see in 2011. So what that means is if we're going up 100 basis points related to mix, if we're going to see an improvement of 100 basis points from mix, and as we've said, we expect our overall gross margins to decline by just less than 100 basis points, that means that there's about 200 basis points on a net basis higher cost versus pricing. So in other words, the impact of higher costs not being fully offset by pricing and that total impact is about 200 basis points, a little less than 200 basis points.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then, Eric, obviously, all this focus on product cost inflation, now we've got sort of oil ramping here as well, kind of your thoughts on potential $4 gas impact on the top line as we think about going in to the -- particularly in the back half of this year?", "Eric Wiseman", "I think, Eric, you raised a real issue that particularly American consumers face is cost inflation across their lives. And that comes home particularly strongly in the mid-tier and mass channels, where as consumers pay more for food and for gasoline, for their cars and for their apparel, it's going to put pressure on what they spend their money on. And we have talked a lot about that. We've talked a lot about that with our customers, and we have built that into our plans. That's what gets us to the mid-single digit unit declines in our Jeanswear business, which we just haven't had. But that's why we're seeing that is we expect great cost pressure to really influence how much consumers can afford to spend on apparel. But we do think we have that adequately reflected in our overall plans for 2011, and we're thrilled that we think we can confidently deliver 8% to 9% revenue growth in that environment.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "I'm just going to have follow-up housekeeping, Bob, for you. Interest expense and tax rate '11?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, tax rate should settle in at about 25.5%. It's a little bit higher than this year. There were a couple of credits that came through -- in 2010, some credits came through that we're not expecting to repeat. In terms of interest, because we paid down a couple hundred million dollars of higher cost, debt interest will be down by about $15 million.", "Operator", "Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital has our next question.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I guess my first question I have is when you talk about the price increases that you're planning and the retailers have accepted it, can you lay out for us sort of your assumptions in terms of if the consumer does not accept the price increases, or is there any recourse that the retailers have to come back to you in terms of mark down money or support from that respect? That's my first question.", "Eric Wiseman", "Well, I think I'd answer that in a pretty broad way, Bob, because of the uncertainty of how consumers are going to respond. We think we've incorporated prudent assumptions regarding prices we're going to ask and the possible impact on unit volumes. I mean, that's how we're thinking about it. We think we've struck a really balanced position in that. And obviously, we have a bunch of levers at our disposal at this point in time in the year. But that is -- I think what Robbie asked up front, what are the opportunities in the plan? And the opportunity and the risk are all around gross margin dollars for us this year. And we think we're in the right spot for our planning purposes.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "And then when you look at the inventories up 12%, I'm talking about that being in line with sort of revenue growth line, but do you feel that you're taking more inventory risk as you look at the environment that we're in with that 11%, 12% increase?", "Robert Shearer", "No, not really, Bob. There's a piece of that, as I mentioned earlier, there's a piece of that that represents a more aggressive buying, I guess trying to get some products in here a little bit sooner than we otherwise would. So there's a component of costs. Costs were also higher as I mentioned specifically in Jeanswear, so that impacted the inventory increase and then bringing goods in a little bit earlier. So no, not really. We're going to plan our business as we normally have, but there are a couple of factors that are impacting the increases you see at the end of 2010.", "Eric Wiseman", "Bob, we have so many big replenishment programs, that as we were deciding to accelerate our purchasing of inventory, we obviously did it in the safest way possible in very large programs that are very low risk to us and our long-term programs with big replenishment cycles. So we could afford to carry a little bit of extra product there and buy it at a lower price. It's the smart thing to do, we think.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "And then just my last question is for Scott, on the mass denim businesses, have you seen changes in terms of mix by brand, like have retailers bought less Lee and more Wrangler, or are you seeing retailers make those sort of maneuvers as they plan for these price increases that you're implementing?", "Scott Baxter", "No, I think it's too early to tell right now. Right now with the year just kicking off and our increases just starting, it's just too early to tell and we haven't seen any fundamental change.", "Operator", "Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs has our next question.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I was wondering, as you guys look at the portion of your marketing investment that's really going towards building future revenue growth as opposed to driving sales in the current quarter, I was wondering if you could give me some weight or some more color on how to think about those investments and the kind of comfort you have that your revenue growth can accelerate to that 8% to 9% from the 7% this year without that incremental marketing spend continuing at the same pace?", "Eric Wiseman", "Michelle, let me give you a little color on the marketing investment just so you understand, and I want to make sure we're all talking about the same numbers. Our marketing spend in 2010 was about 5.5% of revenues, and we're expecting it to be around the same 5.5% of revenues in 2011. So since our revenue forecast is to go up 8% to 9%, we're looking at 8% to 9% expansion in our marketing investment funds. We think we've invested -- we think we've had the right balance of short-term and long-term investments, and one of the reasons there was so much in the fourth quarter was we were driving so much activity during the very important part-time of the year for us, and it showed up in our fourth quarter revenue numbers as we talked about during the release. We think we are in a good spot for 2011 with that level of marketing investment. I'll add that as you think more long term, as our business mix goes to more lifestyle brands, they spend more on marketing and they earn higher gross margins. So it's kind of a self-funding increase. So our mix across VF will hopefully go up in years to come if we're successful growing our lifestyle brands disproportionately.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I mean, I guess the question is in fourth quarter, you obviously grew marketing pretty dramatically and saw a really nice reaction in terms of revenues and that growth accelerating, and I guess the question really revolves around as the revenue or the marketing growth kind of levels off, are you able to sustain that incremental growth momentum that you put up in fourth quarter? But that does help me.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, we're not expecting, obviously, this year to come in at that high of a growth rate, but we did have it. We did deliver a great fourth quarter for us.", "Robert Shearer", "Off of an exceptional growth rate in 2010, that's part of the equation as well.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I guess my second question is just on the inventory dollars. Is there a way to kind of think about in aggregate how you're planning or how you see inventory growth kind of shaking out across the brand for the second half of the year?", "Robert Shearer", "Well, by the end of the year, here's what we expect. We expect that our days in inventory for 2011, our days in inventory will actually decline. So by now, it's an area that we just put constant pressure on in terms of controlling those inventories and reducing risks in inventories. So we expect a five or so day reduction in days by the end of the year. Now again, the offset to that is higher cost product will drive the dollars up more than the day reduction. So there are a lot of factors going on there. But I think the most important piece and the piece that we spend most time looking at are the days in inventory, and we expect that to come down by the end of 2011.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Maybe you could speak a little bit to the RFID program that you guys put in at Wal-Mart. Is that something that you consider to be a contributor to profitability in the Jeanswear business this year? Is there any way we should think about that? That seemed like it should take quite a bit of costing out of the sourcing and supply chain systems.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Michael, I'm afraid we can't comment on that. That's a test that Wal-Mart is running and we're participating in. But I don't want to get ahead of my customer in talking about the implications of that test. So I'd ask you to allow me to just be silent on that topic. Sorry, I just don't think it's our business to talk about the results of that.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "And, Bob, is there any way you could just maybe give us a little bit of detail to help us think about pension expense in 2011 versus 2010 and how we should we be kind of tracking that for the year?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, a little bit different than of course, the increase that we saw a little while back. Yes, pension will come down a little bit in 2011. As a matter of fact, it should help us by about $0.05 a share. Again, that's over the entire year, and it'll be very consistent quarter-by-quarter. So again, you have to divide the $0.05 by four, and that's the impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "And is there upside to that contribution to your earnings if interest rates are to rise at all?", "Robert Shearer", "Actually not. I mean, once that cost is locked in, it's with us for the full year. So the next adjustment won't be made into the beginning of next year.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Steve, so it sounds like the big driver in the Outdoor category this year was -- and in fact the last year the U.S. Sportswear retailers were still playing inventory management game, and they ordered higher product this year to have product flowing into the stores right up to the holiday. It sounds like January, though, some of these guys had run out of inventory with very volatile weather in the news around the country. So when you look at this year, is there a tendency -- do you feel like in the guidance you've given, is there a tendency to have higher inventories after the holiday at this point, or perhaps could that be an area where you could see some upside to guidance if that's what's happening?", "Steve Rendle", "Your question on holiday specific to 2011 holiday?", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Well, to 2011 and then I guess the fact that it sounds like a lot of folks were out of inventory after the holiday with bad weather causing some more demand.", "Steve Rendle", "The way we look at our years, our brands were kind of on a very strong pre-booking model, and we take our customers' orders, build our inventory and are there to service reorder with a very little bit of excess built into our model. And we see retailers really maintaining the conservancy that they had this last year and buying behind those brands that delivered the exceptional results in 2010.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "On the Jeanswear business, have you seen or do you expect to see your customers buying in advance ahead of price increases?", "Scott Baxter", "No, we haven't seen much of that at all. We don't expect any real big purchases here or anybody doing that in the short term.", "Robert Shearer", "For such a large percentage of our business, Jim, is done on a replenishment basis in jeans in particular. So it's a little different business model.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then the second question on the Jeanswear business, the sourcing base for the private label providers, can you characterize that some? And do you expect the price increases you see from private label to be comparable to yours or is there a potential for that price gap between the branded offerings and the private label to narrow?", "Robert Shearer", "Are you speaking to pricing or are you speaking to cost?", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'm speaking to in effect, both. Is there sourcing base such that their costs are going to be higher, and therefore, they'll have to raise prices more to maintain the same margin and therefore, that pricing gap between the private label and the brands narrows?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, I'll speak to the cost first, and Eric may want to comment on pricing. Relative to the cost gets back to some of the earlier comments. Specifically in jeans because we make 65% or so in our own plants, and actually we'll take that up a little bit this year, it allows us to absorb the labor component. So we're all dealing with a bit of a similar issue in terms of fabric. However, I'd also remind you that VF consumes 46% of the total U.S. denim capacity. So we're obviously a big player there, and we like to think that that scale obviously gives us some advantage. Then on the cost side, so the other component then being labor, from a labor standpoint, our cost should be lower, will be lower frankly than is available elsewhere. You know that we produce goods at a lower cost already. And as I was saying earlier, that gap, the benefit that we have by producing our own goods is broadening at this point and it's because of the labor cost influence that's taking place elsewhere in the world. So from a cost standpoint, we do think that we have an advantage.", "Eric Wiseman", "And how that translates to price, Jim, is we don't control that what people charge for things. In fact, it's important as we have all these discussions about inflation that we understand, everybody understand that we set wholesale prices for our products and the retailers set the retail prices. And we have discussion about that, but at the end of the day, we try to manage the gaps that we believe exist between all the brands we compete with, private or national brands, in an intelligent kind of way. But we don't control what retailers charge for their products. So we think we've navigated into the right spot to give us a competitive advantage, and it let us grow some share, but we'll see all that as the year unfolds.", "Operator", "Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo has our next question.", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I had a question about in U.S. Jeanswear, the February price increases you took. I think you said earlier it's probably too early to talk about the customer reaction but can you talk about the reaction from your customers, the retailers? We noticed just being in the stores the price increases to the tune of 10% to 20% both at Lee and leading competitor, and does that sound right, our observations? Because that was greater than we thought, so I was just curious what the customers' reaction was to that. And then the second question is does your EPS guidance assume any buyback, stock buyback?", "Eric Wiseman", "Bob, you want to deal with the buyback?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, pretty easy one. Yes, the buyback, what we did was we bought back an additional 1 million shares at the end of 2010. Our plan is to buy back another 1 million shares in the earlier part of 2011. So we kind of got a nice jump in 2010 on the overall share count. We'll buy back another 1 million in 2011. That's what's built into our plans.", "Eric Wiseman", "And on your question on pricing, and you asked about how the retailers reacted to the wholesale price increases that we've proposed, and they've accepted. And as I said earlier on the call, we have spring plans and fall plans locked down where we have made assumptions about what our wholesale price will be, and retailers bought units accordingly based on how many they think they can sell at whatever price they sell it for. So the retailers and VF have agreed and this is I'm talking particularly about denim. We share a business model for this year, and it's reflected in our plans with them and in the plans we're discussing with you. How consumers are going to react to that is an unknown. You mentioned a 20% price increase in the mass. Now that sounds like a lot to me, but I don't know what -- you could have been going from an on-sale price to a new high price but that sounds really high to me for what we expect to see. Did that help you?", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Yes, it does. It wasn't mass. It was a bit more moderate at the stores I was visiting.", "Eric Wiseman", "I think my comment would stand though. 20% is a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "First, Bob, you mentioned that Jeanswear coalition operating margin will be down less than a point. Can you just give a little color on how you expect the operating margins for the other coalitions to flow for the year?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes. We expect our Outdoor & Action Sports to be very similar to the very high level achieved in 2010. We expect some continued improvement in our Imagewear business. We've been seeing that. We said all along, we have absolutely the right cost structure in place that as we see a little bit of revenue lift, which we've been seeing, and Scott talked about specific pieces of the business that are particularly strong, we expect the operating margins there to improve. And we do expect some expansion in our Contemporary operating margins as well. There were a number of non-recurring kinds of charges included in the 2010 results like getting our inventories in the right place. We were too bulked up on inventories. We had to take charges to reflect that, and those are the kind of things that are included in 2010. So there should be clearly some rebound, there will be clearly be some rebound in our operating margins for Contemporary as well.", "Mitchel Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then you also mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect your marketing spend to be more balanced this year. That would seem to benefit the fourth quarter, I would assume. But how should that impact the earnings just on the quarters in 2011, particularly the first three quarters?", "Robert Shearer", "Generally, Mitch, you're absolutely right on your comment on the fourth quarter. That was the really heavy period, and the impact just wasn't so obvious in the first three quarters. So the way we recognize our overall marketing spend is based on revenues. So as the revenues were stronger in some quarters versus others, you can expect that higher amount of dollars to be spread pretty evenly based on revenues, in other words to be based on the revenue spread. So that means more in the second half of the year than first half.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Just a quick follow-up on the domestic jean business, your primary mid-tier competitor has raised prices over 20%, and there is, while you don't control retailers pricing, there is map pricing which generally drives how retailers do advertise jeans, and it seems like that sudden increase by your primary competitor could create a market share opportunity as you'll probably own that under-$30 branded mid-tier business. So I'm just wondering if you look at it that way and how you're kind of phasing in your pricing relative to that competitor because it sounds like they just went out of the gate in February with that big increase?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, we've noticed that increase as well as you, and we think we have a great value proposition for our mid-tier jeans program. And we hope we're very successful with it. Is that a fair enough comment?", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "I guess the answer is yes then? You think you have a market share opportunity?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, we hope so.", "David Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And then just a quick follow-up on the premium denim business. Obviously, that was a little tough as the year closed, but there do seem to be some signs of life in that business with different rises and different leg treatments, flares, wide legs. Are you starting to see that and any hope in that business by some of those new changes in fashion?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, as Bob commented in his narrative, we invested a lot in 7 For All Mankind business last year. And we invested because we do see opportunities. We had some challenges during the year for sure. I'll first comment that internationally, particularly in Europe, the brand is doing quite nicely, and we're investing very heavily in the brand in Europe. We've also launched the brand in Asia and are beginning to gather momentum there, which brings us to the U.S. market where our wholesale business has clearly struggled. We hope that we have the right products on the right trend for this year. We're clearly more optimistic. We think we've got a lot of our inventory and styling challenges behind us, and we have kind of a team in place that we think is going down on the right path, but we've been conservative in our assumptions for that business and we'll chase it if it gets good.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Todd Slater with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "If prices are up 10% to 20% this year in jeans especially, how do you see that sort of your pricing strategy domestic versus international? And then if you just look out a little further if I may, if cotton prices decline materially in 2012, and I think you're seeing cotton futures down upwards of 30% or so, what do you think happens with the pricing in 2012? Do people try to hold it a little bit and take some margin, or do you think prices will conceivably come down in some of these product categories?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. I forgot the first part of your question, Todd. Just on the second part...", "Todd Slater - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Domestic versus international pricing.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, our domestic business is much more sensitive to product cost increases because the average unit retail in our domestic Jeanswear program, it's 50% to 75% lower than what we sell jeans for internationally. So we're able to pass the cost increases along much more easily outside the United States than we are in the United States, and that's why you see the unit declines that we see. And the second part of your question was longer term, if cotton does come down, we hope that that is a challenge we have to deal with. My guess is that there's going to be -- my guess, and this is purely a guess, is that if that happens, there will be some give back to the consumers because I think that it depends a lot on how the overall economy is. If the overall economy is tough and consumers are struggling to buy apparel, my guess is you'll see more of a give back. And if the economy is really, really strong and the apparel industry is interesting and still offering great value, you would see less. But that's all conjecture, and I hope we have to deal with that in the long term.", "Operator", "Now I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, a quick closing comment. Thanks, all, for your attendance. As I said earlier, we have a March 11 Investor Day in New York City. It will be webcast as well. We'll be talking about our five-year vision for our corporation and how we look beyond the great story we see in 2011 and the things we plan to bring to our shareholders over the next five years.

Please be aware that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference to Jean Fontana from ICR. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in VF Corporation's second quarter 2011 conference call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we will send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results, collaborations or financial conditions of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Group Presidents: Karl Heinz Salzburger, Steve Rendle and Scott Baxter. We've reached the halfway point of our 2011 earnings cycle, and our momentum is building. VF's performance, delivered by outstanding people who manage outstanding brand, continues to be appropriately outstanding. And it confirms that our business model and our execution of that model is consistently strong, especially in challenging and uncertain times. In fact, our second quarter results beat both our expectations and yours. ", "To recap some of the highlights. Revenues were up 15% with double-digit revenue growth achieved by every coalition. This marks VF's third consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth in an economic environment marked by rampant product cost inflation, weak consumer spending and fiscal uncertainty around the world. But instead of throttling back, we have continued to fuel our brands expansion with increased levels of investment spending. And those investments are clearly paying off, as demonstrated by today's results. In fact, VF is firing on all cylinders. ", "Domestic revenues up. International revenues up. Wholesale revenues up. Direct-to-consumer revenues, up. All up, and all at double-digit rates. Our strong revenue growth is translated into even stronger earnings growth. The second quarter earnings per share rising by 17% from first half earnings increasing by 21%. ", "For each of the last 4 conference calls, we've addressed the challenges and uncertainties presented by the unprecedented increases in product costs. We've talked about how these costs would impact our profitability, and what we're doing to minimize that impact. Halfway through the year, we're feeling increasingly confident that we've got it right. Operating margins are holding up very well, down only 30 basis points in the second quarter and up 50 basis points in the first half. Our price increases taken to date, carefully considered in sequence, have shown little impact on our unit volumes. Those 2 words to date are important. ", "Like everyone else, we're waiting to see how the second half unfolds as consumers come face-to-face with even higher prices in apparel and footwear. We don't know, no one knows how they will respond. But the evidence we do have is that strong brands, those that consistently deliver innovative products and experiences to consumers, brands like The North Face, and Vans and Lee and Wrangler, too many. So we're approaching the second half cautiously and controlling those things we can, including spending, pricing and inventories. However, we're confident that we've taken the right actions, and we're anticipating strong second half performance.", "A quick comment on inventories. You will recall that inventories rose 24% in the first quarter. We explained then that the increase was due to the combined effects of higher product costs, foreign currency exchange, buying some goods earlier to secure lower costs and strong increases in unit volume. And we noted that in terms of forward inventory days, we were up only slightly. ", "At the end of the second quarter, our inventories were up by a lesser amount, 17%, and we see comparisons improving as we progress throughout the year. In terms of our full year outlook, based on our very strong first half performance, we're raising our 2011 guidance for both revenues and earnings per share. ", "Now some perspective here. When we began the year surrounded by great economic uncertainty, our revenue guidance was for an increase of 8% to 9%. Five months later, still surrounded by great economic uncertainty, we now expect revenues to increase 12% to 13%. First half revenues rose 14%. And based on today's guidance, second half revenues are expected to rise by about 12%. We're approaching the second half with some caution as we face tougher comparisons and as we wait for consumers' response to higher prices across the board. ", "International revenues, which have been helping to fuel our growth, should increase by more than 20% in 2011, and that's up from the 15% we originally anticipated. Growth in our direct-to-consumer business, another revenue driver, should rise by about 15%, better than the 10% to 15% growth we envisioned at the start of the year. ", "We now expect earnings rising to $7.50 per share, 6% to 7% higher than the guidance we gave back in February and 16% above 2010 earnings per share, excluding impairment charges. Just to be clear here, our revenue and earnings guidance do not include the accretion we expect from the pending Timberland acquisition. ", "As all of you are well aware, on June 13, VF and Timberland announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement. This combination will create $10-billion apparel and footwear powerhouse, anchored in Outdoor & Action Sports brand. And it will bring Outdoor & Action Sports as a percent of VF's total revenues to 50% by next year, well ahead of the 5-year plan we discussed during our March 11 Investor Meeting. ", "In June, we indicated that Timberland could add $700 million to revenues and $0.25 earnings per share this year. And we'll consider the impact from the Timberland acquisition on our full year guidance when we complete the acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter. ", "Over the past 5 weeks, we've spent a lot of time getting to know the Timberland and SmartWool teams better. Our meetings have confirmed what we saw from the beginning. These are highly talented, very passionate teams whose values and business priorities are very much aligned with ours. We are tremendously excited about bringing Timberland and SmartWool in the VF family of brands. With that as a backdrop, let's hear more details from Bob Shearer. Bob?", "Robert Shearer", "Thanks, Eric. Well, as you can tell, we're really proud of the top line momentum that we're experiencing this year. All of our coalitions are achieving solid growth, and all that growth is organic. When you consider the 5-year annual revenue target of 10% organic growth that we established back in March, it's clear that our brands have the bandwidth to deliver on that and possibly more.", "Related to our key growth drivers, our international business grew by 30% in the quarter. It was 20% in constant dollars. Now a few specifics here. Europe revenues were up 30%. Latin America was up 40%, and Mexico was up 26%. And as we've seen in prior quarters, our growth in Asia continues to be outstanding, up 30% in the quarter. In terms of our coalition results, our 2 largest international coalitions, Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear, achieved revenue growth of 42% and 20%, respectively. In constant dollars, those numbers were 29% and 11%. ", "As you know, international growth is a key component of our 5-year plan. And it looks like these businesses are clearly on the right track to hit our goal of 40% of revenues from international. In fact, it looks like our international revenues could grow from 30% to nearly 33% of total revenues in just this year.", "Our direct-to-consumer revenue growth accelerated in the quarter growing by 17%, including new store and exceptional comp store growth, as well as an expanding e-commerce platform. Direct-to-consumer growth in each of our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear and contemporary coalitions exceeded 20% in the quarter. Direct-to-consumer growth in our sportswear coalition was 10%. So far this year, we've opened 44 owned retail stores, and we're on track for a total of around 100 new store openings in 2011. And maybe most importantly, operating margin for our direct-to-consumer businesses for the quarter improved by almost 300 basis points, once again, with across-the-board improvement.", "Now turning to our favorite topic that would be gross margin, of course. You recall that we indicated the tougher comparisons would be in the second and third quarters. And in fact, as expected, second quarter gross margin declined by 120 basis points to 45.9%. And that comparison was helped by the gain recognized in the quarter related to the closing of a facility in Europe. That gain benefited gross margin by 65 basis points. ", "Now I wanted to make sure it was clear that this gain was anticipated and incorporated into both our gross margin and earnings guidance for 2011. We were able to anticipate the timing of this gain because its recognition was based on the date we exited the plant. The bottom line, throughout the benefit from the plant closure, gross margin would have declined by 180 basis points. Again, this is in line with what we expected for the quarter and consistent with any prior guidance.", "Now looking forward, the decline in gross margin in the third quarter will be similar to the reduction as adjusted for that reported in the second quarter. And our second and third quarter's product cost increases are running ahead of pricing adjustments, thus the more significant declines in gross margin. ", "In the fourth quarter, price increases are stronger helping to offset, but not fully offset, the impact of product cost increases. A continuously improving mix from our expanding retail business in the fourth quarter will also help. Accordingly, we continue to expect gross margin comparisons in the fourth quarter to improve. Again, to be clear, that means the reduction in gross margin from the prior year will be less in the fourth quarter than reported in the second and third quarters.", "Now once again, all of this is as planned. With product costs for the year now fully locked in, we're still expecting about 100 basis points of gross margin decline for the year. As we've noted in past calls, this decline largely results from gross margin reductions within our U.S. jeans business, due to the unprecedented rise in cotton costs and the overall lower costs and selling prices of these products sold in U.S. markets.", "And speaking specifically to our U.S. jeans business, unit volumes have increased a bit in both the first and second quarters despite pricing increases that were affected earlier in the year. And yes, that does mean that we are seeing a little less impact from pricing than initially anticipated, of course, good news. This really is a testament to our brand's strong equity and focus on product innovation and differentiation. Additional price increases will take place in the second half as planned. We're very encouraged with what we've seen to date, and we continue to think that we have planned prudently and responsibly for the second half with regards to consumer response to pricing. ", "And one final point here, you are obviously all aware of the dramatic reduction in cotton prices. The December costs related to the new crop is now just over $1 a pound, what a difference from the $2-plus levels that we saw earlier this year. And of course, this is great news to us. But it's too early to predict the impact on 2012. I will tell you this, it gives us great confidence that our decisions around pricing, particularly for our U.S. jeans businesses, have been good ones. Meaning, we never contemplated fully offsetting costs with pricing. These were good long-term decisions that will benefit our brands for years to come. Of course, more to come on this topic in future reports.", "So let's move on to SG&A, which in the quarter was a better than anticipated 35.7% of revenues, down 80 basis points from the 36.5% reported in last year's second quarter. Obviously, leverage from a stronger top line was a big help here. We started the year saying that we expected to see leverage on the operating expense ratio to sales from strong revenue growth. In fact, in the first half of 2011, our ratio of SG&A to revenues is down by 80 basis points from 2010. ", "As we look forward, considering the seasonality of our business and that our second half revenues should be more than 25% higher than first half revenues, we will see even higher leverage within our SG&A ratios to revenues. In addition, you'll remember that in 2010, given the timing of the release of additional marketing dollars, a considerable part of the higher spend fell in the second half 2010 that will also help the SG&A ratio in the upcoming second half. ", "Once again, the bottom line, we remain on track to achieve a full point reduction it in the SG&A ratio this year, with our marketing spend staying close to the very healthy 5.5% level of 2010. And of course, all of that means that we continue to expect our operating margin to be relatively stable with 2010. ", "Now in terms of earnings per share, we were really pleased with the 17% increase in second quarter EPS, given the cautious commentary that we provided to you back in April. As Eric said, the pickup primarily resulted from stronger-than-expected revenue growth. ", "Related to the impact from foreign currency exchange in the release, we indicated the benefit to earnings was $0.03 in the second quarter and $0.04 year-to-date that's also in line with our expectations. Considering the somewhat volatile environment, we're holding our euro rate assumption at $1.35 for the remainder of the year.", "Eric touched on the major points related to our revised guidance. I'll also point out that we continue to expect another very strong year of cash from operations, which should again approximate $1 billion. Our intent is to put that cash to work for our shareholders with the upcoming Timberland acquisition while maintaining a very strong balance sheet. That's been a hallmark of VF for many years, and it won't change.", "Speaking of which, you've likely noticed that we've not repurchased any shares in 2011, even though our practice has been to offset option exercises with our buyback program. Given the Timberland transaction, we're not planning any repurchases for the year. That means that our average share count for the year will increase by at least 1% from stock option exercises. ", "Just a reminder, you might want to check the assumptions for shares in your models. And I need to touch on inventory. ", "Inventory management has been and will continue to be a big deal at VF, and we have a lot of disciplines in place with respect to inventory control. The 17% increase in second quarter inventories was well below that reported in the first quarter. It's important to point out that product costs in inventory at the end of the second quarter were up 9% over last year. So that implies 8% growth in inventory value from unit volume, which aligns with our projected revenue growth net of pricing for the second half of the year. ", "The quality of inventory is high. And as the year progresses, we expect to show continued improvement in year-over-year comparisons, just as we showed significant progress in this second quarter. Obviously, our outlook, as discussed, includes none of the positive impact that we expect from the completion of the Timberland acquisition. Our timetable continues to be for a third quarter closing. We're really looking forward to providing an update at that time by the time we complete the acquisitions later this quarter. And I must echo Eric's comments about Timberland, we're really impressed with the caliber of all the people that we have met there. It takes great people to build great brands. And with every day we spend with the Timberland and SmartWool groups around the globe, we gain an even better understanding of the success these brands have achieved and the incredible opportunity ahead. ", "So another bottom line statement. This was a great quarter for us, and we're headed for another super year for our shareholders. Now you'll hear comments from our 3 Group Presidents, first up, Steve Rendle.", "Steve Rendle", "Thank you, Bob. We're very proud of our brands' performance this quarter. We've continued to maintain very healthy levels of marketing spend behind our strongest brands and our most profitable growth initiatives, and those investments are clearly paying big dividends. ", "As noted in the press release, revenues in our Outdoor & Action Sports Americas business increased 14% in the second quarter, with nearly all brands delivering double-digit revenue growth. As we saw in the first quarter, we saw some decline in our operating margin, resulting from a higher level of brand investments but even more importantly, investments to support not only second half growth but long-term growth as well. Those investments are being made in such areas as product merchandising, upstream innovation, direct-to-consumer and operations. And the impact from these investments have a more significant impact on this, our seasonally smallest quarter. We noted in the release that we continue to expect a full year operating margin of around 20%. ", "Our direct-to-consumer revenues were especially strong in the quarter, with The North Face, Vans and lucy, all growing their direct-to-consumer businesses at double-digit rates. We're continuing to activate The North Face brand activity-based model with very positive results across our outdoor, performance, action sports and youth segments. We're seeing particular strength in outerwear, running, training and yoga apparel, as well as specialty mountain biking apparel. And our e-commerce business continues on a roll with revenues up a remarkable 54%. With fall bookings up 16%, we're looking for another spectacular year of growth for The North Face brand in North America. ", "The 2011 growth rate is forecast to be greater than what we achieved in 2010. And we're on track, ahead of our 5-year plan we shared with you in March, as is our global Vans business.", "Vans' growth was fueled by increases across its retail, e-commerce and wholesale channel. Like The North Face, our e-commerce growth was outstanding, up over 30% in the quarter. Last year, we acquired the Vans business in Mexico from our distributor, and we're pleased with the significant growth we're seeing there. We're on schedule for Vans retail expansion in the New York City metro area, with all 9 stores in our plan now open. And we're looking forward to our first stand-alone Vans partner store in New York City later to open this quarter. With the momentum we've seen in the first half, we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth in North America. ", "A few words on a couple of our other brands in America. We've been delivering solid growth this year with second quarter revenues up over 15%, driven by strength in its core sandals business complemented by the successful launch of a new hanging footwear program. ", "lucy started the year off strongly and continued to show positive momentum in the second quarter with revenues up 10%, supported by e-commerce revenues increasing over 30%. lucy is making good strides in building brand recognition, supported by their title sponsorship with the solstice yoga event in the Times Square last month, which attracted about 6,000 participants. ", "We're encouraged by our results to date. Our momentum continues to build. Our brands have extensive runway for future growth, and we have the strategies, people and platforms to continue to deliver strong growth. We look forward to completing the Timberland acquisition, which will provide our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses with another billion dollar-plus brand, and to working with the great people we are getting to know at both the Timberland and SmartWool brand to accelerate the growth in our businesses. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Karl Heinz Salzburger to review our international businesses.", "Karl Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve. The second quarter marks another period of very strong performance internationally with double-digit growth in both Europe and Asia. In fact, revenues in Europe grew by 16% in constant dollars, with Asia revenues rising by 25%. Operating income grew at an even faster rate over 30% with an expansion in operating margin. ", "In Europe, each of our businesses, Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear, and Contemporary and Jeanswear, saw higher revenues in the quarter. By far, the strongest growth was within Outdoor & Action Sports, with revenues rising by 34% in constant dollars and very strong growth in our 2 biggest brands: The North Face and Vans. And we expect continued strong performance from both brands in Europe. For The North Face, fall bookings are up over 25% and for Vans, over 50%. To support this brand's momentum, we have stepped up our store opening plans, in North Face, opened 5 new stores in the first half with 7 stores confirmed to open in the second half. Vans opened 5 stores in the first half, and we have 12 stores planned for the second half.", "Revenues in our Sportswear and Contemporary Brands business in Europe, which includes Napapijri, Kipling, 7 For All Mankind and Eastpak brands, grew 13% in constant dollars in the quarter. And based on our fall bookings, we look forward to a strong second half as well. ", "Our European jeans business posted a slight increase in revenues in the quarter. Recent activity has slowed a bit since Easter, particularly in the U.K., a large market for us where economic conditions are particularly difficult right now. However, fall bookings in both Lee and Wrangler are up for the prior year level. Better product offerings, upgrades in our own stores and in factory marketing programs are clearly working.", "Turning now to Asia. The story remains as positive as ever. I noted earlier the 25% increase in total revenues in constant dollars. On a reported basis, revenues were up 30%, contributing to that increase of a 34% increase in our business in China with revenues in India, up 52%. Here again, we saw very strong performance in The North Face and Vans brands, both of which delivered revenue gains in excess of 25% in constant dollars. ", "Our Jeanswear business also saw exceptional growth, with revenues up 20% in constant dollars in the quarter.", "We have maintained an aggressive store opening plan and are on track to expand our Asia store base by 25% this year, with 530 new doors planned in China and 125 in India. We also continue to ramp up marketing support in both China and India and developing a comprehensive distributing strategy to further strengthen our brand's connection with our consumers. All in all, we are confident in our plans to deliver revenue growth of over 30% in '11, and we continue to strengthen our team and infrastructure to support our long-term goal of growing our Asia business to $1.3 billion by 2015. ", "In closing, I'd like to note that we here on the international side are also very excited about the Timberland acquisition. We have a strong and growing international base with tremendous future potential. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Baxter to review our Jeanswear Americas and Imagewear results.", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. I will review our Jeanswear Americas business first, which includes our Lee, Wrangler and Riders by Lee businesses and then discuss our Imagewear results. We are very pleased by the strong growth achieved in our Jeanswear Americas business. Our brands are bucking market trends, winning in their respective marketplaces and gaining share. ", "Domestic revenue rose 7% with growth across our mass market, Lee and western specialty businesses, and shared gains in both our Lee and Wrangler brands. We also saw growth across all 3 major international geographies, Latin America, Mexico and Canada, with revenue growth in excess of 25% in Latin America and Mexico. Growth in our Lee brand was particularly strong in the quarter, up 17%. Lee women's has been the brand leader in mid-tier stores for the past 12 months and continues to gain momentum based on an outstanding product innovation, combined with a clear value proposition to consumers. ", "On the mass market side, revenues were up 5% with both Wrangler and Riders by Lee outperforming the competition, gaining floor space and taking share. Of course, we do have our challenges in the form of higher product costs that are impacting margins significantly this year. The third quarter will mark our highest fabric cost of the year beginning to temper in the fourth quarter. Our initial price increases in both the mid-tier and mass channels have been successfully executed. And as Eric noted earlier, we're encouraged by the results to date, with first and second half unit volumes above last year's levels. We believe this is a testament to the tremendous brand equity we have built in our brands and in our efforts to connect consumers with the outstanding quality, value and product innovation they offer. ", "In terms of the second half, we are confident in our brands' ability to navigate through these turbulent times, and are looking forward to continued top line growth across all our Jeanswear Americas businesses. ", "Now I'll turn my attention to Imagewear. Turning now to Imagewear coalition, 2011 is turning out to be a banner year for our Imagewear coalitions, marked by strong double-digit increases in both revenues and operating income. In fact, I'm proud that the increase in Imagewear operating income drove over half of the total increase in VF's total coalition profits in the quarter. ", "As you saw in the release, revenues were up 16% in the quarter, a modest decline in our Licensed Sports Group business, resulted from the fact that we have NHL locker room rights only every other year. More than offsetting this was a 32% increase in image revenues, which saw growth in all market segments and exceptional strength in our protective apparel business. We continue to benefit from very strong relationships with our big customers who increasingly are turning to us to meet their uniform demand, given our service, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to see a return to more normal growth for our Licensed Sports business in the third quarter. Although like everyone else, we are concerned about the unresolved labor issues in the NFL and NBA, and we expect the momentum in our image business to continue through the remainder of the year. ", "In closing, we are pleased with our second quarter Jeanswear and Imagewear results and look forward to a very good year in both businesses. With that, I will turn the call over to Eric.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Scott. As you've heard from the team, we're thrilled with what VF has accomplished in the first half of 2011, confident in our outlook for the balance of the year and very proud of the people at VF who drive our performance. Now let's open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I have a couple of questions. It seems you've gained very good yield on the advertising spend. Do you think you're seeing immediate return on that, those efforts? And if so, are there particular campaigns, Eric, maybe that you could point to that are driving good results for you?", "Eric Wiseman", "Jim, that's a great question because it gets to our philosophy about investing in our brands. As you know, last year, we pulled the trigger on $100 million of incremental brand investment. And we think, we saw some short-term reaction to that and has built momentum for the brand. A part of our brand building is around creating awareness and equity around our brands, people's passion for what we have in our brand. So there's a big part of it that is a long-term investment. And that's why this year, we didn't back off on that $100 million increase. In fact, we've invested a little bit more. The types of things -- obviously, we were measuring the effectiveness of each, and there are lots of examples in all of our brands about what's working. It gets down to everything from the Lee brand work, talking about their men's business in the mid-tier, which was our opportunity there. We have a very well-developed women's business. And last year, we've launched a campaign around the men's business to improve awareness and equity in that. We've got some tactical things in cities in Germany where we've plastered the city with advertising around some of our brands, like Vans and The North Face, that have helped drive traffic into stores. Our North Face campaign last year included tagging certain retailers and markets around certain products. The consumers know what to buy in our new products and where to go buy them. So it's hard for me to get -- I could go on and on about the second part of your question. But we're thrilled with where we are and that we have -- we're in a situation where we'll continue to invest in our brands, and we will do that.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That was great, and those are good examples. Bob or Scott, I understand that your peak material costs will flow through the income statement in the third quarter perhaps with some moderation on the Jeanswear business in the fourth quarter. Can you speak a little bit more about your current inventory position in jeans, and as we look into 2012, how lower cotton costs might flow through the income statement?", "Scott Baxter", "I'll make a couple of comments there first, Jim. You always have to be careful relative to the commentary around our costs. So what we said was that actually we're seeing in our fourth quarter buys, which we're just completing of denim. Now this is what we're buying for the fourth quarter, which will flow through cost of sales in the first quarter of 2012. So what we're seeing is that already we're seeing some reduction in our fourth quarter denim buys, versus our costs in the third quarter. So that means in the first quarter of 2012, our costs -- our denim costs will actually begin to come down and what actually flows through our P&L. Relative to 2012 and denim costs going beyond that, obviously, we like what we see right now, it's a very different environment then we saw, of course, throughout the first part here of 2011, given what's taken place with cotton, so we have a lot more to -- a lot more to say about that. But as you said, costs increasing, what runs through our P&L costs increasing to the latter part of this year. But then particularly in denim, we will start to see that ease in the first part of 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "So I'm just curious really quickly on the outdoor coalition, I was looking at the profitability there. On the outdoor margin, those are down over 100 basis points in the first half, but I'd like to ask about the 20% guidance for the year, if I could. And obviously, that includes an improvement in the back half, so how much of that improvement do you think comes from your assumption that some price increases that you're taking will stick in the back half?", "Eric Wiseman", "Michael, I'm going to start on that. It's really not based on pricing increases at all. It's more based on the seasonal flows of our business. For example, in the second quarter, more than half of that reduction was due to the higher marketing investments. And again, I know that you understand that in the latter part of last year, that's when most of the higher spend fell. This year, it gets spread evenly, so then in the second quarter, it absorbs more of the increased marketing for this year than normal. So that was part of it. So it accounted for over half of the basis point reduction in our Outdoor & Action Sports operating margins. In addition to that, we are, we have -- our fall business, our second half business is always considerably stronger than our earlier part of the year, so obviously we have a big second half plan for those businesses. And we have some expenses that we're building today to support those higher revenues of the second half. That's also a factor in terms of what you see earlier in the year, and particularly in the second quarter because it's by far our lowest quarter of the year. So the marketing spend is a piece of that, and then the seasonality of that business in particular -- particularly within Outdoor & Action Sports, is the other side of it, so it's really not, it's not based on pricing, that's really not a factor. It's much more driven by the seasonality.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "And then if I could follow that, in the second -- if I look at the jeans commentary you guys gave that you're happy you never took price up to fully offset the costs that you're seeing. I think you're probably starting to talk to the retailers now about planning for periods when they'll be looking at a cotton charge lower year-over-year, and you're prices are up. Do you -- I mean, are your early conversations -- do you anticipate being able to hold the price increases that you've put through this year, or will you have to step up promotions? Or people -- are you working with retailers and say maybe we can bring prices back down at this point, or maybe you can help us think ahead a little bit on that?", "Scott Baxter", "Michael, this is Scott. Again, bear in mind that we did not take our increases up all the way to cover our production costs. So we think that was the prudent approach for all of the year. And then going into next year, we think that puts us in a good spot with our retailer community.", "Eric Wiseman", "Michael, I'll add to that. We've talked about gross margin erosion on our Jeanswear business of over 350 basis points. So we're not whole with where we were to coming into this. So if cotton prices come down, the big assumption that is, as they come down, do we get whole -- and that we're honest and open with that with you guys and with our retailers that we didn't offset all these prices. So as they come down, we hope to get back to the kind of margins we had in the past in our Jeanswear business.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, and if I could just add one closing question. It's been a while since you saw a big acquisition, if you could remind us. Will you continue to give us updates on EPS, excluding the acquisition, as we get through the rest of the year to kind of track the non-Timberland business?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, right. Yes, we would do that, Michael, for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Stumphauzer of Sterne Agee.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a couple of things quickly. I was wondering if you guys could touch on growth in Europe. It was obviously exceptionally strong, and we see all the headlines day to day that would suggest that maybe there's a little bit of a -- there'd be challenging consumption trends, that you guys are seem to be doing an exceptional job. I'm just curious to know what you think in particular is driving that. And also, if you could speak to any kind of geographic strength.", "Eric Wiseman", "Karl Heinz, do you want to take that question?", "Karl Salzburger", "Yes, of course. I would say it's a combination of elements. And we clearly have a great organization. We have great brands. You've heard about our marketing initiatives, the product differentiations. And also, what I would add to that is our geographic expansion, we don't have one country. We are very strong. We are very well spread in the big European countries and the good news where there's a lot of noise going on in southern Europe, for instance, Greece. Greece is a very marginal market for us. So that's why I think we continue to do pretty well and have great results so far.", "Eric Wiseman", "Ken, this is Eric. Let me add to that. We've talked for awhile. As good as our business is in Europe, we have relatively low market share and with many of our brands there. So some of what we're doing is -- we're clearly improving the level of our performance. We're investing more in our brand. And importantly, our European team has assembled a world-class retail group that didn't exist there a few years ago, and you're seeing a disproportionate number of our own retail openings happening there. So all of those things are coming together in markets where we, in many cases, had low market share, and we're capturing share that puts us to a much better, much stronger place and more normal on a global level.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then, Bob, my favorite question, can you give us some clarity on kind of the decomposition of gross margin? How much was related to product versus mix?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes. Actually, the mix component, Ken, was held pretty steady from the first quarter. At that point in time, I think, it was 70 basis points is what we said and it was about 80 basis points this time. So yes, the cost net of pricing was about 260 basis points. The mix then helped us. As I said by about 80, and then the gain, the gain that we've talked about on the sale of the plant helped us about 70 basis points as well. Those are the components of the 120 basis point decline.", "Kenneth Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then just one last question, if I could. Obviously, at the beginning of the quarter, the distribution center in Alabama was destroyed. I'm just curious to know whether you felt that had any impact on your ability to meet demand in the quarter, perhaps it hit top line. It might have even been stronger otherwise?", "Robert Shearer", "We talk a lot about the competitive advantage that we have with our supply chain group. And I think the disaster we had in Alabama is just a great example of our ability to respond to something like that and respond very quickly. Actually, Ken, the net loss in terms of revenues was only -- was actually a little bit less than $10 million, and it obviously could have been a lot tougher than that without the kind of people that we have onboard and their ability to respond. So we've got another DC opened up, and had it racked up and ready to go in pretty short order, and we're getting products in because we have -- because we're able to make our own products. We could shift some from our plants to the products that we needed and were destroyed in the tornado. So it was a terrific -- just a job terrific done by our supply chain group, so it had not a -- lot of impact in the quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. Ken, I'll pile along. We were shipping 30 days after the tornado that took down our Hackleburg distribution center. We had an operation up, and we were back to servicing our customers, not at full capacity, but we were operational again very, very quickly and very proud of that team.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "With your increased guidance for the top line, I was wondering if there was a coalition where you saw more upside than where you had originally anticipated? And then my second follow-up question to that is, based on the commentary on your inventory levels going to the back half, can you talk about your ability to chase demand for the outdoor coalition in particular, if demand in the fourth quarter is higher than anticipated?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll start on that. In terms of the first part of your question, I think was there one coalition that really stood out in terms of the increase in the guidance and that kind of thing. And not really -- actually, as Eric went through the -- what we're expecting for the rest of the year on a bi-coalition basis, we would have noted that pretty much across the board, we're seeing strength across our businesses. And it really does, it runs from top to bottom and in terms of our coalitions. So again, we're just really happy to see that. That's why you hear us talking a lot about momentum that we have across our businesses and just really proud of that. So no, it doesn't really stand out in any one coalition that was across-the-board strength.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. You have to call out the Outdoor & Action Sports group for growing 23% globally, and Imagewear is growing 16% globally, really, really strong performance. And our guess is that those coalitions will drive disproportionate growth in the second half as well, but that's all in our forecast. And Steve, any comments on...", "Steve Rendle", "So our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses were primarily on a pre-season booking model. There's a tremendous amount of work that goes into building merchandise assortment and flow plans with our key dealers. We lay in our inventory prior to the season and work through those well thought through plans as we move to the end of that shipping season. So there's not a tremendous ability to chase, but it's really mitigated with the exceptional amount of planning that goes in well in advance based on historical performance.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And then my last question is just about the pricing environment. As we get into the fall, I think we're going to start seeing the floors be set here in the next week or two. Have you have been hearing or have there been any surprises in the pricing environment where maybe you're not seeing some of your competition take as much price as maybe was anticipated or is actually taking more?", "Eric Wiseman", "No, Kate. No surprises yet, really early in the fall season as you rightly called out. Things are just getting set now, and we're not aware of any changes to anything that we've assumed going into this quarter. So far, the price increases that we expected to see we're seeing. And as I said in my comment, the big unknown is how consumers react to the inflation that they're going to see. It's not just apparel and footwear inflation, it's gas, it's food, everything is going up for them, and it's going to be very interesting to watch how that plays out. But we're confident we've made great assumptions around that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul of Barclays Capital.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "I was wondering if you could maybe, clarify a little bit more on the gross margin commentary around the European Jeanswear facility, the impact in the second quarter versus exactly how you think the third quarter plays versus the second quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, Bob. Number one, I'll take this opportunity to state that, yes, the pickup on the gain of the exit relates to actually a charge that was taken in the first quarter of last year of 2010. And it was about the same amount, by the way, about the same effect, so it was like $0.07 a share then in terms of a charge. And actually what this relates to is deferred FX impact related to that charge. And it's kind of a complicated accounting thing, but just to clarify that. And again, I'm glad you asked the question for clarification. Because in my commentary, the point that I said that -- the point that I made relative to the third quarter gross margins I said would be more like the -- more like the second quarter. What I meant by that was, I said adjusted. What I meant by adjusted was taking the benefit of the plant gain out of the numbers. So in other words, I said that the gross margins without that would have been down by about 180 basis points. So we expect the third quarter to be more similar to that in terms of reduction. And in the fourth quarter, and then in the fourth quarter, the reduction should improve from there.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And I think you also said that on -- you're finishing some of your buys for denim in the fourth quarter now. With the recent pullback in cotton, I know you don't buy cotton, you buy denim. But with the recent pullback in cotton, does that provide an opportunity for you to exceed the prior domestic Jeanswear gross margin guidance of minus 350 basis points?", "Eric Wiseman", "For this year?", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "Eric Wiseman", "So you're saying for this year, no. No, because then again, that's the point relative to -- relative to what we're buying right now for the fourth quarter. But those goods, and we said yes, the costs are down a little bit in terms of our buy for the fourth quarter, those goods will flow through 2012. So we'll begin to see the benefit of that, of the lower cost in 2012 but really not until that. Our third quarter buys -- our third quarter buys will flow through the fourth quarter 2011.", "Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Then just one last question. On the pricing increases, can you talk about the magnitude of the price increases you've passed through already, and sort of the magnitude of the future price increases and sort of the delta? And you seemed to be very pleased with some of the unit volumes actually increasing. How do you -- when I think about the magnitude or the higher costs coming into the third quarter, do you feel like the unit volumes can be positive still with the higher prices going in, or do you think units will actually end up falling as expected?", "Robert Shearer", "I'll make a couple of points around pricing. First, just to put a little bit of perspective around overall pricing for the year, it's worth about 3 to 3.5 percentage points of our total revenue gain. If you do some math around that, if you do some math around that, it implies about $300 million worth of pricing. It's very interesting to note that 2/3 of that, 2/3 of that is in our U.S. jeans business. And so if you wonder why we talk so much about our U.S. jeans business in terms of cost and pricing is because it captures such a big piece of that overall pricing impact on our year. So relative to -- can we still be -- so that also says that for the rest of our businesses and our other businesses, the impact of pricing is just not nearly as significant. It's just not so large. So in other words, across the rest of the other 80% of our business. It's the other, it's just the remaining 1/3 of the total pricing impact. So it's fairly small. So it really is more of a jeans, the U.S. jeans challenge for us or issue. Could we be positive in terms of units? We're not anticipating that. As we said very early in the year, that particularly in the second half, even though first half units and as we've said, it's been very positive for us, first half units in our U.S. jeans business are up a couple of percentage points over the first half of 2010, so again really like to see that, and that's great news. But we still have the second half plan down in terms of units. And we said, overall for the year, we were looking at a mid-single digit percentage decline in our U.S. jeans business on those ongoing programs. And we're still planning something more like that. If the consumer responds a little differently, could it be a little better than that? Sure. But that's not how we have the numbers forecasted.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "Among the many things to be impressed with today, one thing that we haven't discussed and maybe is in detail in the Q&A portion, is the inventories. It's been kind of a growing concern across the sector, inventory growth outpacing sales growth. And your guys' inventory seems to be going nicely in a right direction, maybe any more detail around that, especially in the domestic market? And then what your sense is out there at retail and in the channels and some of the competitive level, are you worried about an overinventory situation kind of taking some the steam out of all the positive momentum you have going?", "Robert Shearer", "I'll start on that. In terms of the inventories, Omar, I don't know if you heard the commentary or not. But so the 17% increase, the way we look at that and again, it was a big improvement over what we saw in the first quarter. And I guess, I'd step back and say, you know that inventory and inventory controls and disciplines is just is a very, very important part of how we manage our business here in VF. So it is an area we've put on an incredible amount of focus on. And so relative to the 17%, the first piece you really need to look at is, what's the cost impact of that? To get down to the volume impact, you really need to look at what's the cost impact. And our costs in the inventories as of the end of the second quarter are up about 9%. So in other words, of the 17% increase, 9% alone is driven by --it's just driven by cost increases. So that leads to 8% related to unit volume increases and that matches up really well with what we're looking at through the rest of the year in terms of unit volume increases in our revenue numbers. So the point is we're really, really well aligned right now and very consistent with what we've seen in the past in terms of our overall inventory levels.", "Eric Wiseman", "And Omar, to the second part of your question about, I guess, what you really reference to is, what if the overall apparel industry is overinventoried will that clog up our opportunities? I don't think so. Clearly, that creates a risk, but we've been through that risk before. Just during the recession, you recall during the recession, our revenues held up pretty strong, and that was a time when clearly demand was not adequate for the amount of supply that was out there. And what we did then, is as you know, last year, we invested a lot behind our brand. We have a strong brand. We increased our investment behind them, and we have innovative products. And consumers found a way to those products and not to the stuff that was out there real cheap on sales that there was too much of it. So we're confident -- today, we have stronger brands, a bigger marketing investment and more innovation in our products. So we're pretty confident. There's some risks, sure, but we're pretty confident.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "Eric, do you feel like the industry is overinventoried? Do you think it's maybe not as bad as people think?", "Eric Wiseman", "I'm not -- as I talked to the retailer community, I'm not hearing that as a concern.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then one quick question, if I may, on Timberland. I know you guys did a conference call on it already. But as I've been thinking about the apparel opportunity and the category expansion opportunity, given a lot of VF's core competencies overlaying on the strong existing footwear business, can you talk a little bit in the context to what you guys did with the Vans, which is primarily a footwear brand? And what you've learned from that, that really could help you to help apply to what were you going to do with Timberland?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. We have talked a lot about our experience at Vans, which had a small apparel business when we acquired it and has grown substantially. Now my comment about Timberland's apparel business would be about the U.S. opportunity. We have a very successful European apparel business that's doing quite nicely. So we hope to support that group as they continue to do it nicely. There is an opportunity here in the U.S. We have -- we were just in the process since we do not own Timberland at this point of talking with the current management team about how we leverage VF's considerable apparel skills to -- and knowledge of the U.S. consumers and the channels of distribution what Timberland sells we have experienced with those consumers. And we're marrying that with their brand knowledge and then maybe some execution capabilities that we have around fit in those kinds of things. We can really help them get that right. It's too early to talk about what the outcome of that is. But we are approaching it with at least as much rigor as we approached the Vans opportunity, and we think it's an important opportunity for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.", "Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I had a question on -- on the U.S. jeans business, you just said 2/3 of that pricing, the $300 million is from that business. And I think you said if you could clarify that, that is in the mid-single digit decline in units for the year. Can you talk about what kind of scenarios for that is modeled into your guidance? Because like you said, no one knows what's going to happen in the second half. But how far can that number change before you could miss guidance, for example? If you could talk about that, that would be great.", "Robert Shearer", "I'll certainly try to -- I'm not quite sure I understand the question, however. That is what's built into our guidance. So in other words, the unit decline and the impact of pricing or all the factors that are reflected into our remainder of the year 2011 guidance.", "Eric Wiseman", "And to frame that up in Jeanswear, we're having -- we have a unit increase in the first 6 months of the year, a little bit better than we hoped, given the price increases that we took. And for the year, we're calling for a mid-single digit decrease in units. So we have a lot of erosion to happen in the back half of the year to get to a mid-single digit unit decrease from where we started -- from where we're starting with a positive trend coming in. We have a lot of experience in price changing in all of our channels of distribution and have a pretty good feel for what it might be like. We have been conservative in our planning of that to date, as evidenced by the unit growth we had in the first half. Hoping that's true in the second half, our cautionary comments around that are just because, as I said in my comments, we don't know. No one really knows how this is going to play out. But we think we've got the right assumption. Does that help you?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch", "A couple of quick follow-ups. The first, I was hoping that Karl Heinz Salzburger could give a little more color on Europe. I don't get to Europe as much as I would like to. So I'm trying to get a picture in my head as the types of customers that you're building these big backlogs in North Face and Vans, are these a lot of partnered stores concentrated in any certain regions? Or just maybe a little more flavor on that amazing fall backlog that you guys reported for both those brands, that would be my first question. And second one maybe for Scott, just some more commentary on the flavor, the Jeanswear business in the U.S. specifically who you guys are taking share from. Because it sounds like you are doing a great job with Lee and Wrangler from taking share. Is it private label, is it Levi's? Just some picture on what's going on there. And then the final one for you, Bob, is, I just want to clarify, are you guys actually -- are you guys seeing costs down year-over-year for the first quarter of '12 in Jeanswear? Has the cotton come down enough where you're seeing a year-over-year decline? Is that what we should see from the buying you're doing right now?", "Karl Salzburger", "Karl Heinz here. Maybe, yes, I'll start with the first one, Robert. We said it before, we're doing very well in Europe at the moment. There are a couple of reasons. The big picture is we have a pan-European organization. That means there's none of the big countries like Germany, U.K. where our brands, we're the number one. So that means we have a still big opportunity in terms of penetration with our accounts. That's one of the reasons why we're doing so well on our bookings. Our retail model at the moment has 2 types of models. One is owned stores, which we run, and primarily, on The North Face brands in the outdoor coalition and Napapijri and Kipling, 7 on the sportswear coalition. And then we have a second leg which is department stores, which are basically from a consumer perspective, the same look, the same feel, but the stores are managed by typically a customer of us, and those we have primarily on The North Face and Napapijri. Now the total number is still very slow, very modest, we talk about 50 stores at the moment. And we have a lot of room to grow to grow, that's the good news. So to sum up again, with our brands, The North Face, we still have a relatively modest penetration with our customers and still have a room to grow.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Eric Tracy of FBR Capital Markets.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Eric, if we could -- if we could. I'm not quite sure what their place there. But there were 2 other questions that Robbie, we'll clearly get to your questions. So next, Scott Baxter would respond to the second question that Robbie asked.", "Scott Baxter", "Robbie, we've seen that we're taking share in the mid-tier market are Lee products that really, really going with an innovation platform that's been very successful, both in female and male but extremely successful in female a little bit less in the last 18 months to 24 months. So we're really pleased with that, and we'll continue to go ahead and push on that going forward. In addition to that, we've done a really nice job with our share in the mass channel in men's, and we've had some very nice success over the past 18 months with our Western specialty products with Wrangler with new products and new innovations coming out there.", "Eric Wiseman", "And then the final question that Robbie had was related to, would costs actually be down year-over-year, I think it was specifically around Jeanswear. And no, they wouldn't be. So the first quarter of 2012 will still be matched up against, of course, the first quarter of 2011 when we brought some fairly low costs into the year, right? So we were buying denim at a much, much lower cost at the end of 2010, which was then sold, made into products and sold in the first quarter of 2011. So no, year-over-year costs will not be lower. What will be lower is the first quarter cost. It was lower than they were in the fourth quarter. So we'll just start to see some easing there. But in terms of quarter-to-quarter, no, costs will not be down. So now, Eric, sorry about that.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Real quick, just a couple of ones here. Eric, as we think about going into the back half, the price increases coming through, your sense of the retailer pricing strategy. I know, it's going to be dependent on channel and certainly the unit brands. But what -- how are they pricing, is it relatively consistent? Do you feel like there's going to be some dislocation about how they -- some eating margins, some fully passing through, just a little bit of color on your sense as to how they're planning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. That's a really broad-reaching question, given all the retailers we deal with and all the product categories they sell. I think that everybody is sensitive though to the pressure on the consumers in their channel. And there's different pressures by channel. There's much more pressure on the mass channel consumer than there is on the luxury consumer right now at this environment and for all the obvious economic reasons. And so I think the retailers have been really thoughtful about having, offering the right value for their consumers' shopping in their channel under their circumstances right now. And we're aligned with that, we believe. Will something change as we get into the second half? Could, we're not anticipating, but there's a lot of dialogue around this. And everybody is obviously want to be watching this very carefully as we get into fall. And as we've said a couple of times in the call, so far this year, we have been a little too conservative in the unit volume erosion that we had anticipated. And I would calibrate our conservatism -- is the back half equal to the first half? But it's a bigger deal on the back half. I'm not sure if I adequately answered your question, Eric, but that's the best I've got.", "Eric Tracy - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And really just a housekeeping here, Bob, tax rate back half, how should we be thinking about that?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes. The tax rate will be right around, I believe, it's right around the 20%, 26% in the back half. So that's on a full year basis, Eric, would be really close to 25%, maybe just a little under 25%.", "Operator", "That will come from Taposh Bari of Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I wanted to ask a follow-up on Europe, particularly on the Jeanswear business from Karl Heinz. It sounds like that business has been, I guess, really the only business in your portfolio that's not performing maybe as well as some of the -- or hoping. So I was just trying to get an idea what it's going to take for that business to improve, and if you could talk about any kind of geographic disparity on the continent.", "Karl Salzburger", "Of course. Yes. Well, first of all, we are a little bit victim of amazing net growth numbers on outdoor and sports, right, where we have 25%, you heard it, 30%, which is not easy to repeat. So it looks like if you grow a little bit less but still in a single digits, that's a poor job. So I would say, we had a couple of difficult seasons with jeans. We have reacted. We have improved our product offering. We improved the sweet spot where the brand is meeting their customer demand. We are acting on the advertising side. And we see the results. We see the outcome. We have seen our fall bookings were up. They were up in mid-single digits on Lee, close to double-digits on Wrangler, which is a great result. And we're pretty confident that we can -- we have seen -- we start to see momentum now in our jeans business. But again, we do not expect that very high growth rate we have on Outdoor & Action Sports.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then just a quick follow-up on SG&A guidance for the year. Can you kind of clarify, are you reiterating the, I guess, 100 basis points of leverage for the year? And if so, I'm just trying to understand, why not, I guess, raise that line item, given the fact that in the second quarter as leverage came in a little above where you're looking, and then it sounds like your sales guidance for the back half is a little bit stronger, so I would expect some stronger leverage opportunity there, if you can just touch on that point?", "Robert Shearer", "Yes, we did, we are confirming is the answer to your question, the 100 basis points on the SG&A line. Yes, relative to why isn't it a little better, I think, is what you're saying. And yes, any revenue increase should help us a little bit. We'll also look at our spending levels and in terms of investments that we might make in the marketing side as well. So we're still really comfortable with the 100 basis point reduction that we've set out to achieve.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, everyone, for participating in our call today.

Wiseman", "Thank you, Jean. Good morning, and thanks, for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Group Presidents, Karl Heinz Salzburger, Steve Rendle and Scott Baxter. We are thrilled with the strong performance delivered in the third quarter. Across our portfolio, our brands continued to successfully execute the growth strategies while skillfully navigating through the challenges posed by today's uncertain economic conditions. I have more confidence than ever that the VF business model, diversified, global and financially strong, provides us with a competitive advantage to maximize growth while minimizing risk.", "Let's quickly review the highlights of the quarter. Strong organic growth of 16% in revenues and 18% in earnings per share, double-digit revenue increases in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Imagewear, Sportswear, and Contemporary Brands coalitions, continued growth in our Jeans business both domestically and internationally despite cost and pricing challenges with Jeanswear margins remaining at very healthy levels. The Timberland acquisition, the largest in VF's history, which added over $160 million to revenues in the quarter and delivered better-than-expected earnings accretion. Robust growth in 2 of our primary growth platforms, direct-to-consumer and international, where we enjoyed organic revenue growth of 15% and 29%, respectively. Continued strength in our business in Europe, despite the challenges there, with European revenues growing by 20% in constant dollars during the quarter. Another quarter of outstanding growth in Asia where revenues rose by 43% and an expansion in operating margin, excluding Timberland, to over 16%.", "Of course, the question of the day is, given the softening economic conditions here and the challenges in Europe, what are we currently seeing in our business and what are the implications going forward? Now while we're all hearing and reading about a tougher economic environment, we have seen little evidence of a slowdown in our business. It's true that there are pockets of continued weakness for us. For example, in the U.K. and parts of Southern Europe. Here in the U.S., the upper channels of retail distribution are generally faring better than the lower ones. But across the board, we are very pleased with how well our businesses have held up. We've enjoyed 3 quarters of strong organic growth this year, and in fact, this growth has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Each quarter, we have seen top line organic growth in each of our 5 coalitions, and we're looking forward to another quarter of similarly solid growth in the fourth quarter as well.", "Accordingly, you saw this morning that we increased our revenue and earnings guidance for the year. The components of that increase are twofold. The first is stronger-than-anticipated organic growth. The second is the Timberland acquisition, included for the first time in our guidance. And even though it's still in the very early days for our newest brand, we're really encouraged by Timberland's performance this year and have increased our estimate for earnings accretion from Timberland, excluding acquisition expenses, to $0.55 per share from $0.45 per share. ", "I often get asked by investors, so what keeps you up at night? And actually, I sleep very well because I have tremendous confidence in our leaders and in the strength and long-term potential of our great brands and VF's business model. Now we're very aware of macroeconomic concerns and recognize that we are unlikely to be immune to a significant economic downturn. But our experience has shown that as consumers become more cautious, they gravitate towards brands they know and trust like ours, and they still spend when they see compelling products at a reasonable price. However, there's no question that we're monitoring external conditions very closely and we'll be prepared to act decisively, if need be, to protect our profitability and keep our brands strong and healthy. Now of course, these days no VF earnings call will be complete without some commentary around jeans product cost inflation and pricing.", "The good news here is that the year appears to be playing out just as we had planned. Another round of price increases in our U.S. Jeans business went into effect in the third quarter, and as anticipated, we did begin to see a drop in unit volumes. But we're tracking right on our plan for mid- to high-single digit decline in U.S. jeans unit volume in the second half and only about 4% for the full year. Despite the challenges posed by higher cost in pricing, I'm tremendously proud of the fact that our U.S. Jeans business will post 4 quarters of top line growth this year with profitability remaining at very healthy levels.", "So with that as a backdrop, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Okay. Well, thanks, Eric, and I'd like to echo Eric's comments. This was a great quarter for VF and its shareholders, with continuing momentum across our businesses. We're really proud that, based on our guidance today, we'll be delivering record revenues across nearly every coalition this year. ", "In our full year revenue guidance we're above about 13% organic growth, as well ahead of our long-term target of 10% that we communicated back in March, giving us even greater confidence in the long-term growth potential of our great brands. Now as noted in the release, revenues in the quarter increased 23% with 7 percentage points of the growth coming from the Timberland acquisition which contributed $163 million to revenues. So organic revenues grew a very healthy 16% this quarter. Now you will hear more about the results of our largest coalitions from Steve, Scott, and Karl Heinz, but I would like to point out that both Sportswear and Contemporary Brands had strong quarters with double-digit revenue gains and higher operating margins. The Nautica brand is growing its wholesale department store business and retail comps were up 8%, while Kipling continues to report exceptional growth in the U.S. Our Contemporary Brands business is also showing good growth with total revenues up 11% in the quarter, and growth in the 7 For All Mankind brand, both domestically and internationally.", "Okay now on to gross margin. We've talked a lot about our gross margin expectations this year and continue to be right on track, if not slightly ahead of the guidance we provided earlier in the year. You'll recall that we've consistently stated that the tougher comparisons would be in the second and third quarters of this year. And gross margin did decline in the quarter by 120 basis points, which was the same as that in the second quarter, although we noted last quarter that the gross margin benefited from a 65 basis point gain on a facility closure. So on a comparable basis, the third quarter gross margin comparison was actually better than that of the second quarter. The impact from higher product cost, net of price increases on the third quarter, gross margin was 180 basis points. Helping to offset that was a 60 basis point benefit from mix, as our higher margin businesses: Outdoor & Action Sports, International, and Retail, are becoming a bigger piece of total VF. Now in terms of the Timberland impact on the numbers, as you know, Timberland enjoys a very healthy gross margin, and its gross margin was slightly higher than VF's overall percentage for the quarter. Looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we'll see more of a benefit from price increases which will help offset the impact of product cost increases. And the continuously improving mix from our expanding Outdoor & Action Sports retail and international businesses will play an important part in helping fourth quarter comparisons. Also Timberland gross margins are expected to be somewhat higher than overall VF in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we continue to expect gross margin comparisons in the fourth quarter to improve. Now to be clear, that means the reduction in gross margin from the prior year will be less in the fourth quarter than reported in the second and third quarters. We're really pleased that this is all playing out pretty much as planned. So we continue to expect less than 100 basis points of gross margin decline for the year. As we've noted in past calls, this decline largely results from gross margin reductions within our U.S. Jeans business due to the unprecedented rise in cotton cost and the overall lower cost and selling prices of these products sold in U.S. markets. And one final point here. You're obviously all aware of the dramatic reduction in cotton prices. The December cost related to the new crop now about $1 a pound. What a difference from the $2-plus levels that we saw earlier this year. Of course, this is great news to us. The second quarter of 2012 will be the first quarter when our cost of denim purchased will be below the prior year's quarter. That means it will be late in the second quarter 2012, and into the third quarter, when that lower product cost will hit our P&L. And we'll tell you this. It gives us great confidence that our decisions around pricing, particularly for our U.S. Jeans businesses, have been good ones. Meaning, we never contemplated fully offsetting cost with pricing. These were good long-term decisions have will benefit our brands for years to come. ", "Moving down to SG&A. Ratio of SG&A to revenues was 29.6% in the quarter, down 100 basis points from the 2010 period. That included a negative 50 basis point impact from Timberland, primarily driven by the inclusion of acquisition-related expenses, which is noted in the release, worth $27 million. In other words, excluding Timberland, the year-over-year decline in the SG&A ratio would have been 150 basis points. With respect to these acquisition-related expenses, the good news here is that we've managed to get most of these expenses for 2011 behind us, in the third quarter. You'll recall our initial guidance for these expenses was $0.20 per share in 2011. We now anticipate a slightly higher level of expenses, equal to $0.25 per share in 2011. To date, $0.20 per share of that has already hit our P&L. That leaves only $0.05 per share falling into the fourth quarter. Despite these higher expenses for 2011, you'll note that we increased our full year 2011 guidance for Timberland by $0.05 per share, implying $0.10 per share worth of stronger operating performance. In other words, before expenses. We do expect some additional acquisition-related expenses in 2012, which we noted at the time when we announced the acquisition in June, and we'll have more to say about those when we provide our 2012 guidance. Specific to the fourth quarter, we expect to see another reduction in the SG&A ratio to revenues despite a now higher planned marketing spend over the elevated level in the fourth quarter of 2010. This will be true in spite of the fact that the fourth quarter will include a full quarter from Timberland where the SG&A ratio is higher than VF's, and especially considering the additional acquisition-related expenses as mentioned previously. And on a full year basis, we're still expecting about a full point reduction in the SG&A ratio from the 33.5% reported in 2010 while maintaining our marketing spend at the elevated 2010 level of 5.5% of revenues.", "And that brings us to the operating income line. As you saw in the release, the net benefit to third quarter operating income from Timberland was $13.5 million, which included the $27 million in expenses. Now if you did the math, you'd see that the operating margin for Timberland in the 3-week period, excluding the acquisition expenses, was over 20%. Our timing on the acquisition was good. September is Timberland's biggest month of the year and their most profitable period. On an apples-to-apples or organic basis, that is excluding Timberland, our operating margin would have increased to 16.1% from 15.9%. Given the pressures on our P&L from higher product cost, we're really pleased with our strong operating margin this quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect our operating margin to be relatively stable with 2010 levels including the acquisition-related expenses.", "So moving down to the bottom line. In terms of earnings per share, we were really pleased with the 21% EPS increase. The 18% growth in organic earnings-per-share is particularly impressive when you consider current economic conditions. Again, given our long-term organic EPS growth target of 12%, this performance really points to the earnings power of the VF brand portfolio. And just to make sure that the components of this quarter's EPS are clear, reported earnings were $2.69 per share. The accretion from Timberland in the quarter was $0.07 per share. So the organic growth of 18% is based on an EPS of $2.62. Included in the $0.07 per share accretion was $0.18 per share in acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, the earnings accretion from Timberland was $0.25 per share. So our EPS, including Timberland but excluding the acquisition-related expenses, would be $2.87 or an increase of 29% over the prior year $2.22 per share. Now related to the impact from foreign currency, in the release, we indicated the benefits to earnings was $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.14 year-to-date. Considering the somewhat volatile environment, we're holding our Euro rate assumption at $1.30 for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we now expect reported earnings per share of approximately $7.90. Again, to be clear on what's included here, the Timberland accretion is now expected to be $0.30 per share, better than the $0.25 per share in our original guidance. So on an organic basis, excluding Timberland, we're now looking at full year earnings of $7.60 per share, up from our prior guidance of $7.50 per share. That represents organic earnings per share growth of 18% from the $6.46 per share reported in 2010 excluding impairment. The $0.30 per share in accretion now includes $0.25 of acquisition-related expenses, as I mentioned previously. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, the earnings accretion from Timberland would be $0.55 per share compared to our prior guidance of $0.45 per share. So our EPS, including Timberland but excluding the acquisition-related expenses, would be $8.15 or an increase of 26% over last year's $6.46 per share. ", "And now in closing, a few final points related to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to put a lot of focus on inventory management, and to date, are right on plan. Excluding Timberland, inventories rose 19%. Important to point out that product cost in inventory at the end of the third quarter were up 9% over last year. That implies 10% growth in inventory value from unit volume, which pretty well aligns with our projected revenue growth, net of pricing for the fourth quarter. The quality of inventory is high, and at year end, we expect organic inventories to rise by a mid-teen percentage. With regard to the financing of the Timberland acquisition, we should be substantially out of the commercial paper market by year end, given our very strong cash generation expected in the fourth quarter. By year end, we expect our debt-to-capital ratio to be just under 30%. Given our strong cash flow, by year-end 2012, we'll likely be back to a debt-to-total-capital ratio that's comparable to where we were pre- the Timberland acquisition.", "And speaking of cash flow, we continue to expect another very strong year of cash generated from operations which should, again, approximate $1 billion. As we stated last quarter, our guidance does not include any share repurchases this year. Consensus estimates anticipate our average share count to remain flat year-over-year. But in fact, our average share count for the year for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share will likely increase by 1 million shares to 111.3 million shares. Accordingly, you may want to take that into account as you update your models. ", "So all in all, this was a great quarter for us. We closed on a transformative acquisition that's right in our wheelhouse. And the results to date for Timberland, although for a limited period of time, would support our expectation that this will be an incredible addition to the VF portfolio. And the continued momentum in our core businesses across the board speaks to the payback on our investments behind these brands and the overall strength of our brands with the consumer. I'll look forward to wrapping up the year with you on our February call when we'll speak to our expectations for 2012.", "And now you'll hear comments from our 3 Group Presidents. First up, Steve Rendle.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Good morning. Despite the early hour here in the West Coast, I'm thrilled to be here for 2 reasons: First, because I have the honor of reviewing strong performance delivered this quarter by our outstanding portfolio of Outdoor & Action Sports brands; and second, because this marks the first quarter for Timberland's SmartWool as part of VF, and I have the opportunity to share with you some details of our progress and plans. I'll keep my comments about the third quarter brief, as the performance delivered by our brands in the quarter pretty much speaks for itself and clearly demonstrates our continued strong momentum. Momentum which we have every confidence will continue.", "Excluding Timberland, revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports Americas rose a healthy 13% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in our 2 largest brands, The North Face and Vans. Including the Timberland and SmartWool brand, revenues in the Americas were up 21% in the quarter. In terms of The North Face, last December, we laid out a comprehensive plan to double the size of the brand over the next 5 years, which we confirmed again in March during VF's Investors Day. We are as confident as ever in the strength of this powerful brand. In the third quarter, growth in the Americas was fueled by double-digit increases across the brands wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, including a 61% increase in e-commerce sales. Retail sell-throughs have been strong, and we anticipate a strong finish to the year. And looking forward, spring bookings are up 15% globally with double-digit growth both in the Americas and internationally. The story is much the same for Vans, and I'm looking forward to scheduling an Analyst Day next year to better acquaint all of you with this brand's very special story. Vans also delivered double-digit growth in wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer business. Like The North Face, Vans e-commerce growth was outstanding, up over 41% in the quarter. We're making great progress activating the Vans brand in the key Northeast market. As I noted last quarter, we've opened 9 stores in the New York Metro with results exceeding our expectations. We also opened our first standalone partner store in the meatpacking district of New York City. ", "A quick word on our lucy brand, where we continue to see positive improvement. Over the 2 years, revenues have begun growing at double-digit rate. Store profitability continues to improve and our e-commerce growth of 20% for this quarter continues to exceed expectations. lucy has great potential in the coming years, and we are now poised to capture that potential. ", "In summary, a great quarter and we look forward to wrapping up the year on a very strong note. Now a few words about Timberland. We've noted already the top and bottom line contributions to this quarter's results. We are pleased the momentum we've been seen building over the past 2 years is continuing. While today's numbers include only 3 weeks of Timberland results, for the full third quarter period, Timberland revenues increased over 22% over 2010 levels. SmartWool is a small but mighty brand, with lots of untapped potential. On a third quarter basis compared, with 2010's third quarter, SmartWool achieved revenue growth of 21%. The last few months have been busy and very productive, as we worked closely with our Timberland and SmartWool associates on the integration plans for these 2 brands. I'm very pleased to say that, so far, it's been an amazingly productive process with tremendous collaboration across all of our teams. A big step has been taken with the establishment of Timberland's go-forward leadership team. We've been impressed with the breadth and depth of experience within the brand, which we've now surrounded with the addition of key VF leaders, namely in the roles of President, CFO, and VP of Operations. On the front end of the business, we've retained key talent and are building plans, together, to deliver Timberland's growth initiatives both this year and beyond. We feel very good about the product engine in place at Timberland and are impressed with the depth of knowledge and experience that sits within this organization. And we continue to see great potential to improve Timberland's retail operating model, in-store experience and profitability here in the U.S. in large part by leveraging our skills and experience within The North Face. Given VF's strong financial discipline it should be no surprise that we are hedged down, working to align Timberland's financial processes with ours, in order to provide better visibility into the business for planning, forecasting, and an overall business management perspective. On the system side, we're developing a comprehensive and global technology integration plan that will support growth and synergies while minimizing business risk. And relative to SmartWool, the synergies are already starting, with a full SmartWool stock assortment going into the top 23 North Face stores here in the U.S. over the next few weeks. The SmartWool team will also begin working with our North Face peers as we look at how to develop a more comprehensive apparel platform with a strong outdoor specialty brand.", "In summary, while we'll still very early days, we're tremendously excited about our progress to date. I look forward to sharing details of further progress with you in the future.", "Now I turn it over to Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve. Our international growth accelerated in the third quarter, with strong performance in both Europe and Asia. On an apples-to-apples basis, that is excluding Timberland, revenues in our European business grew 20% in constant dollars. Despite the continued economic challenges here, revenues in Asia grew 43%. And we expect this momentum to continue through the fourth quarter, capping a year of exceptional performance across our EMEA and Asia businesses.", "The strength in Europe was broad-based, with growth in all 3 business: Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear and Contemporary, and Jeanswear. Our brands continued to achieve outstanding performance in a market facing great uncertainty due to the financial crisis. Our business tend to remain steady throughout the quarter and our reorders and forward bookings are strong. In terms of specific market trends, conditions continue to be particularly weak in the U.K. Having said that, our performance in Europe this year is shaping out to be the strongest I have seen in my 11 years with VF. Our brands are winning, and retailers are placing their confidence in brands with proven strength that's of ours. Of course, as Eric mentioned, we will continue to monitor market conditions very carefully over the coming weeks and months.", "We achieved the strongest growth in Outdoor & Action Sports where revenues, excluding Timberland, rose 32% in constant dollars during the quarter. Our largest brand, The North Face, grew revenues by over 25% while our second-largest brand, Vans, achieved revenue growth of over 50%. Both brands are seeing strong reorders, setting up a double-digit base. Our direct-to-consumer initiatives have been a key source of growth for us this year, and we have accelerated our store openings. We expect to open a total of 18 new stores for North Face in Europe this year and 16 for Vans, an increase from our plans earlier in the year. Looking forward, as Steve mentioned, global TNF preseason bookings for spring '12 are up 15% with similar strength in both our Americas and International businesses. For Vans, EMEA pre-spring bookings are strong, up 35%. Our newest brand, Timberland, added about $90 million in revenues here during the partial quarter period. For the full third quarter, Timberland's European revenues increased 30% from 2010 levels. While we have only owned the Timberland brand for a few short weeks, we are quite excited about the opportunities to continue to grow the brand throughout the EMEA region. Timberland has 67 owned and 233 franchise stores across Europe and a very healthy Wholesale business. We are very pleased with what we have seen in Timberland International business today. If anyone want to experience the Timberland brand excellence, I encourage you, visit one of their stores in Southern Europe.", "Our Sportswear and Contemporary Brands business in EMEA achieved revenue growth of 14% in constant dollars in the quarter with double-digit growth in our Napa, Kipling and Eastpak brands. Revenues of our 7 For All Mankind brand also grew at a healthy rate in the quarter, with successful new store openings in major European stores such as Berlin, Stockholm and Paris. Most brands are seeing solid order book for the spring '12 season [ph].", "We are also very pleased with the performance of our European Jeans business in the quarter, where we posted a second consecutive quarter of growth. In fact, revenue growth accelerated slightly in the quarter, rising nearly 4% compared to just a slight increase in the second quarter, and flat results in the first quarter. Particularly in light of very difficult market conditions across much of Europe, we are very encouraged by the success of our product, marketing, and in-store initiatives in both the Lee and Wrangler brands, and expect our momentum to continue in the fourth quarter. And we are seeing stronger growth in our bookings than we have seen in prior seasons.", "Turning now to Asia. We remain very optimistic about our growth prospects in this dynamic and growing market. As I mentioned earlier, total revenues in Asia, excluding Timberland, grew 43% in constant dollars, with our Jeanswear, The North Face, Vans, and Kipling businesses all growing revenues in excess of 35% in constant dollars during the quarter. China remains the cornerstone of our growth story, with revenues up over 50%, stronger than expected due in part to early shipments of fall bookings. Our brands are connecting strongly with consumers, the result of a great deal of consumer insight work that is helping us understand how to tell our brand stories in ways that resonate with China's consumers. In India, another rapidly growing market, revenues increased 58%, fueled by continued growth in our Jeans business there. We have maintained an aggressive store opening plan and are on track to expand our Asia store base by 25% this year with 530 new doors planned in China and 125 in India.", "Timberland contributed about $16 million to our revenues in Asia in the quarter. The brand continues to experience strong growth in the region with revenues up over 30% for the full third quarter versus 2010. We have tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us across both the EMEA and Asia. And we continue to invest in the people and infrastructure necessary to exploit these opportunities to their fullest potential. And the Timberland acquisition provides us with an additional and very exciting future growth platform. ", "With that, I hand it over to Scott Baxter.", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. Good morning. I will review our Jeanswear America businesses first, which includes our Lee, Wrangler, and Riders by Lee businesses and then discuss our Imagewear results.  We continue to be very pleased with how well we are navigating through today's market challenges. Despite the drumbeat of concerns surrounding cost and pricing, the fact is that we have grown our domestic jeans top line every quarter this year, and are on track to do so again in the fourth quarter. The plans and strategies we put in place, and discussed with you at the beginning of the year, are working much as we had envisioned despite some economic weakening in the recent months. ", "As you saw in the release, domestic Jeanswear revenues rose 2% in the quarter. That growth was fueled by really strong performance in our Wrangler Specialty business where revenues grew by more than 15% in the quarter, driven by strength across our core cowboy cut styles, western tops, and women's fashion bottoms. Our direct-to-consumer platform is picking up speed, with 2 Western Specialty partner stores up and running in a robust e-commerce traffic. We also enjoyed another quarter of solid growth from Lee where revenues grew 5%. Our product innovations, including Lee Classic Fit and Premium Select lines are working and driving continued gains in market share. We did note that our Mass Market business declined slightly in the quarter. Of course, we anticipated that the top line comparisons here would be more challenging in the second half than in the first. Given the sensitivity to price increases by consumer shopping at Mass Market stores, it is true that trends in the channel in general have softened a bit. The good news is that our Wrangler and Riders brand at Mass continue to outperform the competition and gain share. internationally, we enjoyed double-digit revenue growth in all 3 major international geographies: Latin America, Mexico, and Canada.", "Now a few additional comments about cost units and pricing. The cost of our denim purchases peaked in the third quarter. As Bob noted, the cost of cotton has declined significantly, but we won't see this flow in to our P&L in the form of lower product costs on a year-over-year basis until the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter 2012. In terms of units, as a reminder, while we actually saw jean unit volumes increasing in the first half of the year, we indicated that we expected to see unit volumes decreasing in the second half of this year at a mid- to high-single digit rate. As expected, we began to see the unit declines in our U.S. Jeans business this quarter, primarily in the mass channel in conjunction with the most recent round of price increases. This will continue in the fourth quarter as well, again in line with our expectations. For the full year, as Eric noted, unit volumes will be down around 4%. This year has presented many challenges to our U.S. Jeans business, but I'm very proud of how well our teams have met and overcome those challenges. ", "Now switching gears. I'll focus -- I'll close with a few words on our Imagewear results. Despite economic headwinds, our strategies have positioned Imagewear to surpass the $1 billion mark for the first time this year. Relative to the third quarter, we posted a 14% increase in revenues. Again, the growth was balanced with double-digit growth in both our Image and Licensed Sports Group business. In terms of our Image or Uniform business, the strong growth there is being driven by growth across our protective apparel and industrial sectors. The Bulwark brand of fire protective apparel may not be a household name today, but with the impressive growth we've seen this year, it may be soon. And in our Licensed Sports Group business, we benefited from a rapid recovery in our NFL businesses as the season got underway, as well as from our new college program and rapidly growing women's NFL Apparel business. ", "All in all, we're extremely pleased with our performance this quarter and look forward to delivering another solid quarter of growth in the fourth quarter as well. Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Scott. So as you've all seen, the diverse VF business model that includes many brands, product categories, and geographies, all supported by an amazingly talented team of associates, continues to perform very well. With that, we'll take all your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually 2 quick questions. The first question was -- I just wanted to maybe get a little more color on The North Face's spring bookings of up 15%. It's a little bit of deceleration for what you were seeing for fall of 2011. Is it reflective of all of what you might think the bookings could be like for fall 2012 or -- just some color on that would be great. And then the other question was just, could you remind us Timberland accretion for 2012 and how that looks now that you're further into owning Timberland?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. I'll ask Steve Rendle to comment on The North Face 15% bookings increase for spring. Steve, you want to comment on that?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. Robby, we're still -- we're right at the back end of our spring business season, and the growth that we've seen here in the Americas has been above our expectations. And as we look to fall 2012, the brand branch just finished its sales meeting last week and we'll hit the road this week. And we remain very, very confident that we'll deliver against the type of growth we've seen historically.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Before I turn the next question over to Bob, Robby, you know that The North Face is a third and fourth quarter business and, similar to last year, the first part of the -- spring bookings are a much smaller pieces of the business. It's a much smaller part of our product categories and, generally, a lower bookings rate. Bob?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure. And, Robby, on the second point, I think it was to remind what 2012 looks from an accretion standpoint for Timberland. What we said was, before expenses adding $0.90 a share, and net of expenses $0.75 a share. Now what we also said was that we got a little bit more of the expenses than we anticipated in 2012, actually into 2011. So I guess all in, Robby, given the fact that the performance has been a little stronger, right? In terms of our original expectations to date and we have some more of the expenses behind us, we're feeling good about 2012, obviously. And so if the expenses were to change from that, obviously we'd expect more in terms of cost reductions. So once again, relative to what we played out for a 2012, at this point we feel very good about that.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeff Klinefelter, Piper Jaffray.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "A couple of questions, Karl Heinz, on the International business. First of all, for Europe, looking at your constant currency growth in Q3. Could you just remind us again, what that was in Q1 and Q2? And then, just curious on composition of the growth. How much pricing advantage are you getting versus kind of your core unit growth, and wholesale versus retail? A little color on that would be helpful.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Bob, you have to help me. I don't remember by memory, what our Q1 and Q2 growth number were in constant dollars. So maybe while I answer your question, your second part, maybe Bob can help me out. I don't remember by memory, and eventually I have to come back to you, Jeff, on this one. We had -- primarily we see 2 types of growth. The most important one was unit growth in most of our brands. We were exposed, on the Jeans side, on price increases. So there is also a price component. So what I would say, Jeff, is? As you know, my 11 years with VF this is one of the rare moments where it seemed virtually all brands, which we have in our portfolio, which are literally growing, including Lee and Wrangler. So it's a very unique moment. Some brands are starting faster than others, but the good news is all of them are growing. So that's good. And as I said, most of them actually is units and not so much driven by price. We had some price increases on jeans, but again, the growth was very healthy. Bob, do you remember the Q1 and Q2 numbers?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I'm sorry, Karl. I don't have it in front of me at this point in time.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Why don't you give Cindy a call after we got off this call, and we'll get that information to you.", "Jeffrey P. Klinefelter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Yes, that's no problem at all. Maybe just one other then, Karl Heinz. In terms of Asia as well, 43% growth. I think you said 25% retail growth or new unit growth this year in terms of doors. Again, outside of that, is the balance of that growth really unit driven or are you seeing any sort of pricing advantages in Asia?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "One thing, which we do very carefully, Jeff, is we do monitor the performance of our comp stores, right? Because, I mean, Asia and China primarily is all our retail markets. So our comp stores are up. So that's the good news. As we said in the past, we have a relatively low penetration, still, in those markets in terms of doors, number of doors. Yes, we do open 25% this year, but if we benchmark ourselves to the 2 big players in China, we are still very, very small and have -- in other words, we still have a good way to go, going forward, in terms of simply more doors. Did that answer you?", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joseph Parkhill from Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the pricing in denim and how confident you are that you'll be able to keep your pricing the same throughout the end of the year. And then what's the likelihood of keeping those prices next year? Is there risk that the competition lowers pricing next year?", "Scott Baxter", "We're going to take it market by market, and I'll answer the latter part of the question first. We'll find out and figure that out as we transfer through rest of the year next year, in the second half. But I think the single thing that's most important here, as you talk about this question, is that we did not, from a cost standpoint, the cost that we saw, the increases that we saw in cost, we did not take our pricing up nearly what our costs were up. So we're really thoughtful in how we thought about that going into 2012, even in the latter half of 2011. We put a lot of time into that thinking that we didn't want to do that. We wanted to make sure that we stay competitive and we're really confident in the pricing strategy that we had for the latter part of '11 and going to '12, and we're very hopeful that we will go ahead and hang on to that. Did I answer the question?", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, definitely. And then just quickly, commentary about marketing spend in the fourth quarter was that -- that it's still going to be up year-over-year? Is that correct or -- and if you are, where are you making those investments?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, it is. It's interesting, when we started the year, I know we talked a lot about that and the reason we did was because our spend was so elevated in the fourth quarter of 2010, you might recall, by $45 million. So just in the fourth quarter alone, of 2010, we spent $45 million more than we did in the prior years and the prior year period. As we entered the year, what we indicated was, for the fourth quarter -- that we though our marketing spend actually be down a little bit in the fourth quarter, given that, given that we're up against that big increase in 2010. But at this point in time, we're spending some more. Again, we've seen such great success relative to our overall marketing spend and the investments that we've been making beyond our brands. We're convinced that at least plays a part in terms of the momentum that we're seeing. So at this point in time, we will spend more in the fourth quarter than we did over the high level of last year. Now our percent to revenue will be down just a little bit, but not as much as originally planned. So our percent to revenue will be down 30 basis points or so from the elevated level from last year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Christian Buss of Credit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide some color on the Timberland accretion guidance for the fourth quarter. Did that include the incremental debt expense associated with the acquisition?", "Robert K. Shearer", "It does.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then, could you talk a bit about your inventory composition? How you feel about the inventory composition?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. Relative to inventory, of course, the question is always not only what we're holding, but also how we stand at retail. And as we look at our inventory levels at retail, we feel that we're in good shape. They're right in line with our growth expectations that we expect to see in the quarter, and also relative to those inventories that we hold. As I said earlier, not only are the unit volumes in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter growth in the fourth quarter, but also the quality of that inventory is good as well. So it matches up well with what we'll be selling in the fourth quarter. So all in all, our inventories are in good shape.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Kernan of Cowen.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "When you acquired Timberland, it sounded like the margin recovery baked in the story was largely SG&A related, but it seems like in Q3 the gross margin on the Timberland side of the business was really strong. Can you talk about the margin recovery and margins in Timberland next year as we try to model that business in your P&L? Is it SG&A and gross margins? More of it just to cost cutting?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Just a couple of points there. Relative to gross margins, the Timberland gross margins have been higher than overall VF. So I mentioned that in my commentary, that in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well that will be the case, a little bit higher than overall VF. Now having said that, we do see opportunities to improve the gross margins over the coming periods, for sure. In terms of SG&A leverage, you're absolutely right, that is a big piece of the overall opportunity that we've seen. And we pointed out for 2012 that we expected to reduce the SG&A level, mostly SG&A, by about $35 million. Still on track to achieve that. So actually, the gross margins have always been strong at Timberland, remain a little bit above our overall level, and we see opportunity for improvement there. And yes, relative to SG&A that is an opportunity for us for sure, and we'll see some reduction there as well. So it really is -- it's both pieces.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Imagewear and Sportswear, I know there's more pieces in mix but they continue to post upside, at least to our expectations. Is there any reason to believe that top line momentum and the margin momentum that's in those businesses the past -- basically through this year, would flow into Q4 or next year?", "Scott Baxter", "John, this is Scott. I'll answer the Imagewear question then turn it over to Eric for Sportswear piece. I have no reason to believe that you'll see anything different on the Imagewear, top line and bottom line going forward, for the fourth quarter.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, and it's the same-store story for the Nautica business. That business had some model improvements to make in both the wholesale and retail platforms. They've been working hard at that. And we thought, by the end of this year, we'd begin to see kind of growth we expect from the business, both in the top and bottom line. We're seeing it and don't expect that to change.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A question for Eric or Steve. You've had your eyes on Timberland for some time. Is there anything you're prepared to say about your strategy for positioning the brand going forward? Specifically, what is it you'll be doing differently?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Steve, that question is right up your alley.", "Steven E. Rendle", "All right. Good morning, Jim. As we get to know the Timberland brand, our initial impressions are being confirmed. They stand behind the statement that they are the rugged New England outdoor lifestyle brand. And we see this tremendous opportunity to build behind that vision from a product standpoint, specifically in footwear and apparel. But how do we start to tell that story to the consumer through enhanced marketing messages? But most importantly, how do we start to tell that story to the retail stores? Karl Heinz mentioned, if you want to see really high-quality Timberland story, you should go to the Southern European markets. And we'll look to begin to build those stores -- build against those stores here in the Americas market at some point towards the end of next year, and really tell and expand that story here.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Steve, how does that align with where you see the Apparel business for Timberland in the U.S. as you look towards developing that?", "Steven E. Rendle", "The apparel business is a great opportunity. And initially we said that was about a $300 million opportunity that we would build over the next 5 years. And we see great opportunity in taking that leather and canvas story that the Timberland brand is following so well in their footwear. And how do we bring that into apparel and really define what that rugged New England outdoor lifestyle looks like? They have a very strong Apparel business in Europe, designed in our London design center. And we look to really leverage that and bring that to life here, beginning in fall 2012 in our stores and then do a full scale launch in fall 2013, across wholesale and direct-to-consumer.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul, Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Couple of questions. First, on the Timberland acquisition, Bob, are the cost synergies still the same? I think you had outlined $35 million. Has that changed at all? And then the second question that I have is around the European businesses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit more, country-by-country, a little deeper in terms of any of the trends that you're seeing differently within the VF brands and also within the recently acquired Timberland businesses?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Bob, I'll start on the -- the $35 million, has it changed, was the question and no, it hasn't changed. And as I said earlier, we're confident in our ability to get at $35 million for next year. Again, that's a 2012 number and that number will increase with time. So there are further opportunities beyond that but that's the number that we identified for 2012.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And Bob, I'll ask Karl Heinz to think some about your question in Europe. As you know, it's a complex question because of the number of brands that we have and how those brand strengths appear in different markets in Europe. Karl Heinz, could you make some general comments about what you're seeing there?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, Bob. The good news is that we are growing, actually in most of the countries. Even in the one which have a little bit more pressure from the economic situation. I guess the good -- we have a great and a winning business model. We have a portfolio of brands and geographies which we can play with. Not only in Asia and Europe, but even inside Europe. We have Northern, Center, Southern Europe, and then the emerging markets, which are the markets of former communist markets. We do see sometimes, Bob, some specific brands which might decline. What we do then, we accelerate the introduction of others. I'll give you an example, Greece. Everybody talks about Greece. Greece is a very small market in our portfolio of markets here. But even here, year-to-date, we are growing. We are down on one jeans brand, but we just launched these -- to grow The North Face. So it's growing from a small base but it's growing, and we launched last year in Napa, that's growing. That's the way we do. We play to sum up with the portfolio of brands and the geographies inside Europe.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And, Eric, I just have one question for you. From the owner of Majestic, any predictions on the World Series from where we are today?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, yes. happy to deal with that question. We are predicting a really engaged competitive 7-game series during which we sell a whole lot of apparel.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad, ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. During the market volatility a month or so ago, I mean, did you guys see any change in your business trends at retail? Especially in the higher end brands where you're may be touching more affluent consumer, and we saw some of those people watching their personal portfolios? And then to follow up on Europe too, I mean, plus 20% constant currency is obviously an amazing result, given all the headline news that we're seeing out there. Could you talk about -- if you look at how Europe played out for you guys in '08, '09, there was a little bit more weakness there, especially on denim side. Is the business structured differently today? Are North Face and Vans a bigger piece? How should we think about that business differently than what happened a few years ago, in Europe, for you guys?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. Karl Heinz, I'll let you think about Omar's second question while I deal with the first. Yes, Omar. In the first couple of weeks, in August, when there was only a lot of negative press out there. We saw a slight decline in our growth rates. And I answered that with those specific words because we didn't see a decline in our business, we saw a business that had been growing. In some of our brands as much as 20%, and comps store business slowed down a little bit. And then it recovered in the end of August and then we had a very strong September in those brands. So I don't know if there were any long-term decision changes made by those shoppers, but there was a slight reaction to that. It recovered very, very quickly. And that was our experience this time around. And Karl Heinz, can you talk about the status in Europe?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, absolutely, Omar. You asked the question whether the business is structured differently. So we had 3 legs in the past '08, '09, which is Jeanswear, Sportswear, and Outdoor & Action, and we still have 3 legs now. Well, Timberland is new. So apples-to-apples, what is very different now is the weight. Clearly, outdoor is growing much faster than the others. So the weight inside this portfolio is different now compared to the past. From a geography point of view, clearly in our business the biggest markets are the big 5 businesses: Germany, U.K., Spain, France and Italy. That has not changed. The penetration into this market is bigger. But the big change is that our portfolio has changed compared to 4 years ago, you mentioned. Jeans is lower and Outdoor & Action Sports is now the dominant piece.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And, Omar, the only thing I would add to Karl Heinz's is, in the last 24 months, we put a much heightened emphasis on the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Russia. And we think there's a much bigger opportunity there, we're now structured and organized to capture that opportunity.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And now that I recall, the other of that which is different is our retail presence, right? We started to push retail initiatives, especially in Vans and The North Face, and Napa where we had much more than we had in the past.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So a couple of questions here. Could you tell us what the margins would have been for the Outdoor & Action Sports business if we stripped out Timberland in the quarter? I'm assuming that Timberland's lower 4-wall margins in the direct-to-consumer business shifts the mix in there a little bit. So I'm curious what it looked like excluding Timberland.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Excluding Timberland, Michael, the margin was 23.5% in the third quarter.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So actually improving on a year-over-year trend?", "Robert K. Shearer", "So yes, really close to last year.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I think in the past, you've told us that about 85% of your fall business for North Face was done on pre-order and the rest is pull from retailers. I think you plan for that. Can you give a comment on how that's tracking versus planned right now? Are you seeing, early in the season, the retailers pulling above the planned amounts?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I'll ask Steve to deal with that question from a U.S. perspective because I'm sure that, that comment was made in the context of the U.S. market.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes. So we are, our fall business is trending as planned. We've seen very solid sell-throughs, both in our own stores and in our major wholesale channels. And those rates that we've talked about historically, we actually have a slightly higher preseason to total shipment. And that stays in line this year, and we're seeing good tracking into -- moving those preseason orders into the market place, and we're now coming near that time of season where you start to see the reorders kick in.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And you're seeing some of the reorders start to pick up in line with the plan or above the plan?", "Steven E. Rendle", "We're tracking right as we thought we would be at this time of year.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, and if I could just -- maybe, Bob, 1 question, really quickly. If I'm not mistaken, I think Timberland does some of their own manufacturing. Is that right?", "Robert K. Shearer", "That's correct.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And I don't think, in the past, you have acquired brands that do much of their own manufacturing. obviously, as a legacy manufacturer, you guys have some core competencies there. As you look through the manufacturing operations, is that something may be where you think yourself -- and this is an area where we could add more -- we could take more costs out for this brand relative to brands we have in the past?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Actually, it's kind of interesting, Michael, in terms of the opportunities that we see from a gross margins standpoint. From everything we see, the Timberland group, they are very, very good at the manufacturing side. Once again, from everything we've seen in the limited amount of time is very efficient within the plants. What we do see is an opportunity more around what we'll refer to as the operations side. In other words, managing inventories, how much we make, when we make it, how far we get ahead or not. Those are the kind of things where we think we can bring some real disciplines and improve the overall margins.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Michael, actually the question for us, about the owned Timberland manufacturing plant is, how can we leverage that to enable our footwear business in some of our other brands like The North Face or Vans. I mean, is there an opportunity to leverage that expertise, because it's in the Caribbean basin, and improve our business model in our own business. And that may be the big opportunity.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "That's a great question. Do you have an answer to that?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "No. But you get 4 shots a year at asking me. So we'll talk sometime later.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michelle Tan of Goldman Saks.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering, Karl Heinz made the comment earlier, about this being kind of a unique period for VF and that all of the businesses, even those that have historically not been high-growth businesses, are putting up these great numbers. The color at the individual business level was helpful. But I was wondering if there's anything that you guys are doing differently at a high level, across the portfolio, that's driving some of the accelerated growth in some of these businesses that haven't been growth business before.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "We're investing more and as you know one of the things, as we look back over the last couple of years is, in 2010, we made the decision to increase our brand investments by about $100 million and then we were keeping at this rate, this year. And we think that's been incredibly important, across our portfolio and across our geographies, to our growth. The other thing -- the reason it's been important is it's been effective. And the reason it's been effective is because we've done terrific consumer insight work to understand exactly how to reach our consumers. Kind of what they're looking for, for us, how our brands and messages differentiate. And it's easy to spend more money. It's harder to spend it effectively, and I think consumer insight work has really guided us.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And that's something that you're even doing in the Imagewear business and with NFL license across the board, in terms of the consumer work and some of the efficiencies that you guys have been able to uncover from a branding perspective?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, Michelle. A couple of things that we've done is we've really taken advantage of the fact that we've got a terrific merchandising team there and have done a really nice job with the male consumer in the past. And over the last 2 seasons, we've really done a very nice job with the team and the female consumer. And we've seen the portion of our Female Consumer business grow dramatically over the last 2 seasons and we have that plan to continue in the future. So we're fortunate to have that NFL license and very fortunate to have re-signed that license going forward, too.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.", "Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First on the Timberland, can you tell us a little bit more about their European business? Maybe what are the largest countries, maybe percent of sales from the U.K. or Southern Europe that are more at risk to see a potential slowdown. And then the second question is on the U.S. Jeanswear business. As you look into next year and your cost come down, how do you think about the retailers\u2019 reaction knowing that they know your costs are coming down in terms of them asking for a lower cost to them as well? Kind of how do you think some of those dynamics will play out?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Karl Heinz, do you want to provide a little bit of color on the Timberland business in Europe?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, I can, of course. Timberland has 3 main areas in Europe. What they call Central Europe, which is basically Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the German spoken part. The northern part, which is U.K. and Scandinavia and the southern part, which is Italy, France, Spain, Greece. The largest market, historically has been Italy, for a long, long time. Actually, it's the second-largest market after the U.S. So in a head and head with Japan. So they always had a historical international presence. The second-largest market in Europe is the U.K. So you might answer, you might think the 2 most double markets. But I can tell you the spring bookings Timberland had for spring of '12, Italy and Southern Europe were still growing. So they show good growth. We also monitor, very carefully, the presence of the stores that they have. And, especially in Southern Europe, they have a priority of franchisee stores over owned stores. Big number of franchisee stores. And we monitor that very carefully. So to sum up, 3 big areas. Largest market is Italy. Second-largest is U.K.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And Scott, the second question?", "Scott Baxter", "Yes, specifically, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, we're really -- in 2011 as we saw the cost increasing and when we saw what was happening with cotton, and denim, and fabric, we were really very thoughtful in our approach as to how we were going to going to go ahead and position the brands going forward. And what we did is we did not pass along all those cost to our retailers. And we ate a lot of that going forward. And we had a strategy that we thought would help position our brands going forward with all of our retailers. So we think and we feel very comfortable we're going to hold onto a lot of that pricing going forward in 2012.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mitch Kummetz of Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Let's see, First question for Bob. On the gross margin you're saying, for the year, down less than 100 basis points. The big puts and takes there have been product cost and mix. When it's all said and done for the year, what do you think the impact from those 2 items will be? I mean, are you looking at mix? Kind of the benefit of 100 bps and maybe product cost down by 200? And then as we start to think about next year, any reason to think you won't get the same benefit from mix in 2012 as 2011? And then on the cost side, I mean, it sounds like the way cotton is going to flow through the P&L, I mean, is that sort of a net neutral cost in 2012?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, that was a lot. I'm going to try to touch all those points, Mitch. So relative to the full year, yes. What we said was, beginning of the year a little less than 100 basis points. Actually like now, it looks a little better than that. In other words, we were kind of guiding to something like 90 basis point, and looks like the comparison, the reduction could be a little bit less than that. So relative to mix, your question on mix, yes, it's about 100 basis points. That's what it is, and that's -- we started the year, and we said that's been pretty consistent. That's where we've been seeing. And for 2011, it looks like yes, there's going to be about 100 basis points of improvement coming from mix. Let's see. You also talked about product cost, I believe going into next year, was that...", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Let me ask you this. So if mix is plus 100 bps this year, any reason it couldn't be something similar next year, especially with the Timberland full year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, as we said when we laid out our 5-year plans we indicated that mix would be a significant factor as we went forward in the overall improvement that we projected, in terms of gross margin. So these large businesses continue to get larger and continue to grow at a faster pace. So we do expect that there will be some -- that the mix benefit will continue whether it's 100 basis points or not, it's a little hard to say. But it will be significant. Retailer's a big component of that as well. So it will continue to be a significant factor as we go forward.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it. And then if mix is about 100 basis point benefit this year, then cost would probably be something 150 or so drag on this year and then that should dramatically improve next year I would assume, right?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. And we always talk about this cost net of pricing or it's cost net of price this year looks to be something like 170 basis points, right? So the overall gross margin is down by 70, once again, that's 170 cost net of price, about 100 from mix and that's to the 70.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then tax and interest expense in the fourth quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, cash and interest expense. Overall...", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Tax.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Oh, tax. Tax in the fourth quarter, let me answer the interest first. The interest in the fourth quarter will be up about $9 million. Obviously, it's related to the financing for Timberland. And by the way, just in terms of throwing out the models, as we look to next year, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it looks like interest will be up $7 million to $8 million per quarter. So hopefully that helps a bit. In terms of our overall tax rate, in the fourth quarter, looks like just below 26%.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then last question. Karl Heinz, consolidated spring backlog for Europe or pre-books. However you want to talk about it.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, I mentioned we don't really look at that way, Mitch. We look at brand-by-brand. But I can say there, as I mentioned in my press release, most of them are actually up. Both in Europe and Asia.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to David Glick of Buckingham Research.", "David J. Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Eric, just a question on price elasticity. You gave us some good color on the mass channel. And I was just wondering, as you look at your business across your brands -- and this is really more of a North American question than globally. Do you see a correlation as you kind of move up the price point ladder and distribution channels where price elasticity -- certainly have you seen the reaction to price increases more muted as you move up your brand ladder and distribution channels?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, David. In essence, we have. Clearly, the shopper who shops primarily in the lower channels of distribution is the one who has the smallest amount of discretionary income and they're the most cautious and react the most to price increases. And the other comment I'll make, as a general rule, where we have new products coming out, with no pricing history, those products are just judged based on the value they deliver. And a big part of our business across our channels has that. Differentiated products tend to be able to get higher value. Where everyone I think is struggling the most is in carryover products where prices need to go up. We're seeing the biggest pushback, and that's true on all channels. So there's 3 core dynamics or 2 in our channels. Does that answer your question?", "David J. Glick - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Mid-tier though, where it is -- maybe not quite as price-sensitive as the mass channel, but it looks like where you've taken a more gradual or moderate price increase strategy relative to your competition, it looks like you're gaining share. I just wonder if that's a fairly accurate observation.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes. We've said, all throughout the course of the year, that looking at our U.S. Jeans business, we were going to have over 350 basis points of gross margin erosion. And we approached our pricing decisions strategically. We asked ourselves what's the right price point for this product to be at so that it's successful in the channel of distribution that it's in and how does it relate to the other styles that it sits next to. And as Bob said in his comments, he thinks we've been pretty effective and smart about how we did that this year. Which puts us in the path to next year, where we have to make the same kinds of decisions as we approach the back half of the year where no denim prices will be down. And the question there, as Scott mentioned earlier, is how much of the 350 basis points of gross margin erosion do we recover and how much do we reinvest strategically in our brands to continue the success. And I have no doubt that our Jeanswear team will be just as effective as that next year as they were in the past year.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "No, I just thank you all for your time and interest in our company. We think we have a lot of interesting things going on, and our team is really executing well. See you next quarter.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference, ladies and gentlemen.

Please be aware that today's conference is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, Ms. Jean Fontana. Ms. Fontana, please go ahead, ma'am.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you.

Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; our 3 group presidents, Steve Rendle, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter; as well as Karen Murray, President of VF Sportswear; and Susan Kellogg, President of VF Contemporary Brands. I'd like to start off today's call by answering a question I know has been on everyone's mind lately. That question relates to the impact of unseasonably warm weather on VF in general and on The North Face, in particular. I'm delighted to report that in the fourth quarter of 2011, The North Face achieved a 22% increase in global revenues, and this was no easy comp. In the fourth quarter of 2010, The North Face achieved global revenue growth of 25% during an exceptionally cold and snowy winter season globally. Here are some additional numbers. The North Face Americas business grew by 24%. European revenues rose 12% in constant dollars, and Asia revenues increased 41% in constant dollars. I hope that this helps put to rest concerns about the ability of this powerful brand to grow, even in less-than-ideal conditions. We are confident that The North Face's momentum will continue in the years to come, and we look forward to achieving our 2015 revenue goal of $3 billion.", "Now with that piece of the picture behind us, let's talk some about the year and the quarter just ended.", "2011 was a year of records: record revenues, record earnings, record cash flow from operations both  on an organic basis and, of course, including Timberland, which represents another VF record, the largest acquisition in VF's history.", "We continue to be thrilled about the opportunities that Timberland and SmartWool offer VF and our shareholders. We delivered revenues and earnings accretion in 2011 above our initial expectation. We have outstanding teams in place at both Timberland and SmartWool, who are working incredibly hard to realize all the synergies and growth we laid out for you at the time of the acquisition, and we're confident that both the Timberland and SmartWool brands will be important drivers of VF's success for years to come.", "The VF team delivered an impressive array of accomplishments in 2011. First, solid organic revenue growth in each and every VF coalition and higher operating income in every coalition except Jeanswear, for reasons we have discussed throughout the year, continued momentum at both The North Face and Vans brands, both of which grew over 20%.", "Internationally, organic revenue growth was about 20% in constant dollars. Including Timberland, international revenues were 34% of VF's total revenues. And speaking of international growth, despite the well documented financial challenges in Europe, our organic revenue growth in Europe was 16% in constant dollars. In Asia, an area of continued investment for us, organic revenue growth was greater than 30% in constant dollars, and in our direct-to-consumer businesses, we achieved organic revenue growth of 15%.", "In terms of the fourth quarter, we're delighted to wrap up the year on such a strong note, with total revenues rising 37%, and organic growth of 11%. I noted earlier the strength of The North Face in the quarter, but that doesn't tell the whole story. All the VF coalitions achieved solid organic revenue growth in the quarter, and both our international and direct-to-consumer businesses posted double-digit organic growth in the period.", "Remember a year ago, at this time, we talked at length about the key issue of the day: higher product costs. And we've laid out our assumptions for 2011 and acknowledged that no one knew how those assumptions were going to play out. So how did we do? We indicated then that the impact on gross margins from higher product costs would be just under 100 basis points. The reported gross margin was down 90 basis points. And we guided to an operating margin that was flat with 2010 levels. Our operating margin, excluding Timberland, was up 30 basis points to 13.6%. Including Timberland, our operating margin was about flat.", "I think that speaks volumes about VF's ability to execute in the face of highly challenging and volatile conditions. We recognize that this issue continues to be on everyone's radar for 2012, and Bob will have more to say on this in his comments.", "I know another big issue out there is the outlook in Europe. As I mentioned, our organic revenues in Europe grew 16% in constant dollars in 2011. We did see some slowdown in the fourth quarter, with European revenues growing by 14% in constant dollars versus the 20% growth achieved in the third quarter. In times like these, it's important to appreciate the benefits of VF's diversified model. Europe represents about 20% of VF's total revenues, but we are highly diversified there, with a presence across European markets that remain relatively healthy, such as Northern and Eastern Europe. Our brands still have low market shares in nearly every major European market.", "The substantial marketing investments we've made over the past couple of years and will continue to make in 2012 are paying for themselves in the form of strong, profitable growth, which we'll continue this year. In fact, our Europe -- our revenues in Europe in 2012 are expected to grow more than 10% in constant dollars. Of course, we're constantly monitoring events overseas and are prepared to course-correct as needed should conditions change dramatically.", "With 2011 behind us, our focus is now squarely on 2012 and on achieving the results we've laid out in today's release. To quickly summarize, we expect to grow revenues by 15%, or 17% in constant dollars, and that will take us very close to the $11 billion mark.", "Organic growth is pegged at 8% in constant dollars, which we think is a prudent assumption given the uncertainties surrounding economic conditions here and abroad.", "All VF coalitions are planning to deliver solid organic growth with another outstanding year of double-digit organic growth in Outdoor & Action Sports. Timberland should add $1 billion to revenue growth this year. You'll hear more from Steve and Karl Heinz about our plans for Timberland and the steps we're taking to ensure strong, long-term growth and profitability.", "In 2012, our international business should be 37% of total revenues, so we are well on our way towards achieving our goal of 40% of revenues from our highly profitable international markets by 2015.  ", "And we're closing in rapidly on our 2015 goal of 22% of revenues coming from our direct-to-consumer business, with direct-to-consumer revenues approaching that level this year.", "Finally, in terms of earnings per share, we've acknowledged the twin headwinds of foreign currency translation and higher pension expense. And as mentioned in today's release, we expect these headwinds to impact our earnings per share by $0.60 in 2012. Yet despite these headwinds, we're looking forward to another record year with adjusted earnings per share expected to reach $9.30, up 13% over 2011.", "So we enter 2012 with confidence in the power of our brands to continue the momentum, with conviction in our ability to execute against our plans and with a great deal of excitement about the many, many opportunities that still lie ahead.", "I'll turn the call over to Bob now to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Bob?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Thanks, Eric. These are truly exciting times for VF, with strong momentum across our brands globally. I'd also point out another big milestone reached this year. With the Timberland acquisition, VF will have more than half its revenues coming from Outdoor & Action Sports. The portfolio transformation that we envisioned several years ago has become a fast-growing, highly profitable reality.", "Quick point before I dive in. The release contains financial data on an adjusted basis. The adjusted data excludes 2 items: expenses related to the Timberland acquisition in 2011 and 2012 and the impairment charges recorded in 2010. We hope that this helps you better interpret our results.", "Now let's start at the top with revenues. Revenues in the quarter increased 37%, with 26 percentage points of the growth, more than $0.5 billion, coming from Timberland. So organic revenues grew at a very healthy rate of 11% this quarter, and that is on top of a strong Q4 in 2010. The momentum continues. And for the year, revenues grew 23%, with 9 percentage points of the growth coming from Timberland. We exceeded the $700 million in revenues targeted for Timberland in 2011. Their total contribution was $713 million. Organic revenues grew 14% in 2011, which is substantially above our long-term organic revenue growth target of 10% that we established in early 2011. The power of the VF portfolio, diversified, global and growing, is clearly evident in these results. ", "So onto  gross margin. Our original gross margin guidance on a full year basis was a decline of just less than 100 basis points. So we're really pleased that on a full year basis, we navigated our way through the challenges related to higher product costs, with full year gross margin down 90 basis points.", "In terms of the fourth quarter, we were a bit behind the gross margin guidance we provided back in October. The reason: We experienced a modest gross margin pressure from onetime expenses in our U.S. Jeanswear business, including a charge related to the bankruptcy of a supplier.", "And to anticipate a question that you might have, Timberland did not have a material impact on gross margin in the quarter as their gross margin was comparable to that of VF's core businesses.", "Now in terms of SG&A, you'll also recall that our guidance for the ratio of SG&A to revenues in 2011 was a decline of 100 basis points. On a reported basis, SG&A declined 80 basis points, but that reduction was impacted by the inclusion of Timberland.", "Timberland's SG&A ratio to revenues is substantially higher than that of other VF businesses and, in 2011, also included onetime acquisition-related expenses.", "Excluding Timberland, the SG&A ratio for the full year 2011 declined by 110 basis points, or 10 basis points better than our initial guidance. In the fourth quarter, the negative impact on the SG&A ratio from Timberland was 90 basis points. Excluding Timberland, the SG&A ratio would have declined by nearly 150 basis points.", "Obviously, this speaks to the opportunities we see for future improvements in profitability and margins for Timberland and also to the benefit that we've seen from leveraging our strong organic growth.", "In addition, you'll recall that the SG&A ratio in the 2010 quarter reflected some heavier investments in marketing spending, which also helped the comparisons.", "Let's move on to the operating income line. As you saw in the release, earnings from Timberland contributed $43.3 million to operating income in the quarter, which is net of $6.7 million in onetime acquisition-related expenses.", "For the quarter, the operating margin for Timberland, excluding the onetime expenses, was 9%. If you exclude Timberland, our fourth quarter operating margin increased 10 basis points to 13% compared with the 2010 adjusted operating margin of 12.9%, despite the gross margin pressure I noted earlier. On a full year basis, excluding Timberland, our operating margin moved to 13.6% from 13.3% in 2010. With the inclusion of Timberland, our reported operating margin for the year was 13.2% and adjusted to exclude the onetime acquisition-related costs, 13.5%.", "Now let's bring it down to the bottom line. For the year, adjusted earnings per share grew 27% to $8.20 from $6.46 in 2010. That's a $0.05 beat to our prior guidance of $8.15 per share from stronger-than-anticipated accretion from Timberland. Timberland contributed $0.60 per share in 2011 on an adjusted basis. That is excluding onetime costs. On a reported basis, Timberland's contribution was $0.38 per share. Organic earnings per share growth in 2011 was 18%. That is $7.60 versus the $6.46 reported in 2010, something we're quite proud of and well ahead of our long-term growth target of 12%.", "And for the quarter, adjusted EPS rose by 30%. That's based on $2.32 per share versus $1.78 per share reported in the 2010 quarter. Timberland provided $0.34 accretion in the quarter, excluding $0.04 of acquisition expenses.", "And now before moving on to our 2012 guidance, a few points related to our balance sheet and cash flow. Excluding Timberland, inventories were up 12%, with 9 percentage points of the increase due to higher product costs. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape. As expected, we did generate sufficient cash by year end 2011 to pay down the commercial paper borrowings related to the Timberland acquisition. The remaining short-term borrowings on the year-end balance sheet support current working capital needs. And from a cash generation standpoint, 2011 marked another very strong year. In fact, our cash generated at $1,081,000,000 was a new record high. ", "Okay. So let's review our guidance for 2012 and our plans to deliver another year of double-digit revenues and earnings growth to our shareholders.  Revenues are expected to increase 15%, or 17% in constant dollars. A note here. We are putting a particular emphasis on constant dollar amounts in our discussions related to 2012 given the headwinds presented by foreign currency translation for the year.", "As you know, our biggest exposure is to the euro and for planning purposes, we are using a 1.25 rate for 2012. Given where the euro is today, that would indicate some upside. To answer your question in advance, every 5-point movement in the euro is equivalent to about $100 million in revenue and equal to approximately $0.18 per share.", "Timberland should contribute about $1 billion to revenue growth this year. That's on a reported basis, or $1,050,000,000 on a constant dollar basis. You'll hear more about our plans for Timberland from Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz in just a minute. In constant dollars, excluding Timberland in both 2011 and 2012, revenues should rise by 8%, which is pretty close to our target for organic revenue growth of 10%. We realize there's still a lot of uncertainty out there related to economic conditions both here and abroad, so we're taking what we think is an appropriately cautious approach to our guidance this year.", "Now following all the concern and discussions around gross margin in 2011, we're looking forward to getting back on track with gross margin expansion in 2012. In fact, we're looking for about 70 basis points of gross margin expansion over the 45.8% reported in 2011.", "Now to be clear, as we discussed during our third quarter call, we'll continue to experience higher product costs through the first half of 2012, so that increase will all occur in the second half of the year.", "Our operating margin in 2012 is targeted to improve, and that is despite higher pension costs, which will negatively impact our operating margin by 30 basis points. Timberland's operating margin should improve significantly in 2012 and could exceed 11%.", "Excluding Timberland in both 2011 and 2012, VF's core operating margin should improve to about 14%, and that includes the 30 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense.", "So we are pointing toward, once again, making great progress as we set our sights on achieving our 15% operating margin goal. ", "Now wrapping up now with our earnings guidance, our target for adjusted earnings per share for 2012, again, that's excluding Timberland-related expenses, is approximately $9.30. That implies 13% growth over our adjusted EPS of $8.20 in 2011.", "Talk about the puts and takes here. First, we expect $1.10 in adjusted earnings from Timberland, which is higher than our original estimate of $0.90 that we committed to when we first announced this great acquisition. Our experience has obviously been quite positive to date, and also, as detailed  in the release, our adjusted EPS guidance of $9.30 is held back by a $0.60 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and higher pension expense.", "In constant dollars and without the pension expense increase, adjusted EPS would be up 21% from the adjusted EPS of $8.20 in 2011. If you go a step further here and strip out Timberland from both 2011 and 2012, the growth in VF's core EPS, once again, excluding foreign currency exchange and pension impacts, would be 16% over VF's core EPS of $7.60 in 2011. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share are expected to increase 14% to approximately $9.10 per share from the $7.98 per share in 2011.", "Let's talk for a moment about the cadence of our earnings per share results in 2011. There are a couple of significant factors that will impact our flow of earnings  this year. First, product cost reductions in our Jeanswear business will benefit gross margin starting in the third quarter. Up to that point, higher product costs will continue to pressure gross margin for Jeanswear and for VF in total, especially in Q1.", "Next, Timberland is a highly seasonal business, with much stronger second half results than first. Historically, Timberland has recorded losses in their second quarter, and while we see their profitability continuing to improve, we expect the same for 2012 for this business.", "Next, the FX impact will be biggest in the first and third quarters, which are the biggest quarters for our international business. And finally, the $0.19 increase in pension expense will be spread evenly across the 4 quarters.", "So our earnings gains for 2012 will clearly be back half-loaded, but the second quarter being our most challenged earnings comparison. ", "And finally, I should comment on our planned capital expenditures for 2012, which are expected to increase to $375 million. The good news here is that this higher level of spend is directly related to the success and growth that we're experiencing across our businesses. We'll be investing in new headquarter locations for our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, new distribution centers across the globe and continued store growth investments that we're more than happy to fund.", "In summary, 2011 has been a year like no other for VF, marked by tremendous momentum across our brands and around the world, capped by the transformational acquisition of Timberland. We look forward to delivering another strong year in 2012 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and earnings growth objectives.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Rendle.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Bob. On our third quarter call, I emphasized the momentum that our global Outdoor & Action Sports business continues to build, a momentum we're particularly proud of as  we finish out a record year and enter 2012 with our strongest portfolio ever. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrates the investments we continue to make in our brands, our infrastructure and our ability to connect with consumers is contributing to a very exciting long-term growth story.", "Clearly, our results for both the quarter and year benefited tremendously from the Timberland acquisition, but we're just as excited about the organic growth we achieved during both periods.", "Excluding Timberland and SmartWool, our core Outdoor & Action Sports Americas revenues grew near 20% in the fourth quarter, including double-digit revenue increases from The North Face, Vans, lucy and Reef. For the full year, again excluding Timberland and SmartWool, our Outdoor & Action Sports Americas revenues grew nearly 15%, with solid growth achieved at The North Face, Vans, JanSport, lucy and Reef. ", "Taking a quick look at some of the brand highlights, it's easy to understand why we believe 2012 will be another great year for us. Starting with The North Face. As Eric mentioned in his opening remarks, the brand showed amazing resilience in the fourth quarter in the face of unusually warm weather, with a 22% increase in global revenues. In fact, The North Face Americas fourth quarter revenue growth was the strongest we've seen all year and included strong double-digit d-to-c growth in both retail and e-commerce channels, as well as mid-teen increases in our wholesale business.", "For the year, The North Face Americas revenue growth finished ahead of our global 5-year compounded growth goal of 16%. And as noted on our last call, spring 2012 bookings for The North Face were up 15% globally, and although early, we're encouraged by what we see for fall.", "As the #1 outdoor brand both in the U.S. and globally, the success of The North Face is due to our continued sharp focus on executing against our activity-based strategy. This model is driven by industry-leading product innovation that is athlete-tested and expedition-proven. In 2012, product innovation takes a dramatic leap forward with 4 technologies. Two examples include our revolutionary Flash Dry apparel, which works with your body to regulate its temperature by accelerating moisture removal and dramatically improving dry time; and our new Cradle  cushioned footwear, which equips elite athletes with maximum stability and comfort, for any foot, on any terrain.", "In summary, The North Face is looking forward to another great year of record revenues. On a worldwide basis, in 2012, we're targeting mid-teen revenue growth and remain on track to achieve our goal of $3 billion in total sales by 2015.", "Turning now to Vans. Vans also had a tremendous year with ongoing investments, including further retail expansion, grassroot marketing efforts targeted at influential consumers and athletes and a heightened social media presence. Our efforts are clearly working. Fourth quarter global Vans revenues saw  25% revenue growth, with a double-digit increase in our Americas business, and that growth was well balanced with gains in all channels, including U.S. retail, wholesale and e-commerce.", "In fact, vans.com continues to break records with 28 million unique visitors in 2011. Social media is an important marketing tool for Vans, and our marketing work is paying off, with the brand's Facebook fans exceeding 4 million. For the full year, Vans Americas had double-digit growth that, I'm proud to say, helped push global revenues well past the $1 billion mark for the first time in the brand's 46-year history. This is a major achievement that we're all very proud of, so congratulations to Vans and the amazing team around the world, whose ability to stay authentic to the brand's consumers while driving growth continues to inspire generation after off-the-wall generation.", "2012 promises to be another very strong year for Vans, with global revenues targeted to grow at a mid-teen rate. Going direct to consumers remains our greatest opportunity to showcase the Vans brand and products. We'll continue to activate the brand outside of its core West Coast market, building on the success of new stores in the Northeast regions added in 2011 and our rapidly growing e-commerce business.", "Moving to Timberland and SmartWool, the fourth quarter marks the first full quarter of contribution from these high-potential brands, and we feel very good about their results. Globally, the Timberland brand achieved revenue growth of more than 10% in the fourth quarter, less than the very strong rate we saw in the third quarter, which is not surprising, considering the unfavorable weather conditions. SmartWool revenues grew 20% in the fourth quarter. We entered 2012 highly energized and ready to take full advantage of VF's resources to do what we do best, position both brands for healthy, sustainable and profitable growth. These are still early days for Timberland within VF, and we have much to do to realize the full potential of these great outdoor brands. ", "Our 2012 to-do list is extensive. First, we'll be supercharging Timberland's product engine for maximum innovation. Second, we'll continue to align Timberland's financial and planning processes with those of VF to ensure clear visibility into current and future business performance. Third, we're working on a comprehensive global technology integration plan to support growth while minimizing business risk. And last but not least, we'll continue to assess and adjust Timberland's wholesale distribution to build the strongest possible connection between the brand and its outdoor-inspired consumers.", "Looking more immediately at 2012, we're targeting low single-digit global revenue growth for the combined Timberland and SmartWool business, but that doesn't tell the whole story. In constant dollars, the growth increases to a mid-single-digit rate, and if you take into account the impact of some highly targeted and strategic business exits to improve Timberland's distribution, we're looking at a high-single-digit growth rate for the year.", "We're fully cognizant of the fact this is below our 5-year compounded growth rate of 10%, but it will take time to fully activate all of the growth opportunities and synergies envisioned in our 5-year plan. For example, 1/3 of the year -- of the 5-year revenue target for Timberland is slated to come from our U.S. apparel launch, which won't take place until fall 2013. ", "And to add some additional context, I see many parallels to our early days with The North Face. Purchased in 2000, for the first 2 years, The North Face revenues remained relatively stable as we worked through distribution and operational issues. And as we all know, the rest is history.", "Today, we are fortunate to have 2 brands, the North Face and Timberland, with combined revenues of roughly $3.5 billion, who are both passionately committed to embedding sustainability across their products and operations.", "As authentic outdoor brands, both The North Face and Timberland understand the importance of getting consumers outside to enjoy and appreciate the environment and to protect and conserve it for future generations.", "Before I conclude my comments, I also want to acknowledge great performances from lucy and Reef. On our last call, I noted that we are very well positioned to capitalize on lucy's potential given the success of new product introductions, strengthened  revenue trends and improved store profitability. I'm happy to report that lucy had a record year, with healthy double-digit profitable growth, and we anticipate even stronger results in 2012. In fact, we have amazing new products that are hitting the stores right now, and early indications are very positive. And finally, Reef. Another story of strong double-digit growth, profitable revenue growth, with another great year planned for 2012. ", "In summary, a terrific finish to 2011, and as noted in today's release, we're looking forward to delivering another solid year of growth for our Outdoor & Action Sports business.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Heinz, who will take you through our international results.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve. On our last call, I mentioned that VF's 2011 international business was shaping up to be the strongest I had seen in my 12-year career with the company. Today, I'm happy to say that is, in fact, the case. With 20% organic growth in constant currency revenues, including double-digit increases in Europe, Asia and India, growth across nearly every brand in our portfolio and significant gains in our direct-to-consumer business, 2011 was a record year for our international business. ", "My review of our businesses today will focus on results in constant dollars. In Europe, each of our 3 businesses, Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear and Contemporary and Jeanswear, achieved organic revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and full year. Taking a deeper dive into our European Outdoor & Action Sports business, excluding Timberland and SmartWool, we achieved revenue growth of over 25% in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by tremendous momentum at Vans, where revenues grew more than 50% in both periods. Spring bookings support another strong year in 2012 as well. The North Face also enjoyed a strong finish to 2011, with a double-digit revenue increase in the fourth quarter and nearly 20% growth for the full year. The momentum continues here as well, with solid spring 2012 bookings pointing to another strong year.", "I would also like to congratulate the Vans team in Europe, whose passion for the brand and hard work contributed to growth well above the 24% revenue increase that Steve referenced earlier.", "In their first full quarter as part of our portfolio, Timberland and SmartWool Europe enjoyed very healthy growth. For the full fourth quarter period, revenues increased at the mid-teen rate. Timberland is now the largest brand in our European portfolio, and while market conditions are still difficult across Southern Europe, long term, we are bullish on our growth prospects as we continue to expand Earthkeepers in both apparel and footwear and continue to build Timberland's overall apparel business.", "Our European Sportswear and Contemporary Brands coalition achieved moderate growth in the fourth quarter with higher revenues in our Eastpak, Kipling and 7 For All Mankind brands. For the full year, European Sportswear and Contemporary Brands revenue rose 10%, and based on healthy booking to date, we believe this business could achieve similar growth in 2012 as well.", "Taking a look at Jeanswear in Europe, we are pleased to report that the business grew in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by the strength of our Lee brand. The best news here is that the work we have done behind the scenes to improve operating efficiencies is yielding significant improvement in our profitability.  Looking ahead to 2012, we expect continued modest Jeanswear growth in Europe as we navigate through today's challenging conditions.", "I noted earlier that conditions are weak in southern Europe, particularly Italy. However, we remain cautiously optimistic as retailers continue to place priority and confidence in brands with proven sell-through strength, such as ours.", "In summary, for 2012, given our current visibility and market conditions, we are targeting greater than 10% organic revenue growth in constant dollars for our European business. ", "Let's now turn to Asia, a pillar of VF's growth story both today and in the future. Organic revenue growth in constant dollars in Asia was about 20% in the fourth quarter and over 30% for the year. For both periods, we achieved strong double-digit organic growth in nearly every brand.", "China remains at the center of our long-term growth story. We are continuing to invest in consumer insight work that is enabling our brands to connect more strongly with local tastes and preferences. For The North Face, our work is concentrated around encouraging outdoor participation in a way that's relevant to Chinese consumers.", "And with respect to Timberland, which is now our largest single brand in Asia, we are very excited about our long-term growth potential. VF has a strong, well established platform in China, which we are eager to leverage to enable Timberland's future growth. In fact, we expect to grow our Timberland business in Asia by more than 15% in '12.", "India is another rapidly growing market for us, and you'll recall that in September, we acquired the minority interest in our joint venture there, with the business now operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our growth in India remains strong, with full year revenue growth over 45% in constant dollars, and we are looking forward to a very strong year in 2012 as well.", "We are very well positioned to continue the momentum across our brands in Asia. We have well established platforms in place encompassing 4 key categories: Jeans, Outdoor, Action Sports and Sportswear. 2012 should be another great year for us in Asia, with revenues growing more than 20%.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Baxter,  who will take you through Jeanswear and Imagewear in the Americas.", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our Jeanswear America business first, which includes our Lee, Western Specialty and Mass businesses, and then discuss our Imagewear results. We entered 2011 with our key Jeanswear brands as strong and well positioned for growth as they have ever been, yet with the sharp rise in product costs you are all familiar with, we knew we faced a tough year and an unprecedented margin pressure. Accordingly, we went heads down and devised a short- and long-term plan to navigate through an environment, the likes of which we have never seen. We implemented strategic pricing actions to help mitigate costs while growing our retail floor space and market share. We elevated our product innovation agenda to ensure industry-leading style, construction and performance, and we supported our brands with strong, targeted demand-creation efforts, investing marketing dollars to forge even stronger connections with our consumers. So how did we do? We did well. The year ended on a strong note, with the fourth consecutive quarter of top line growth and full year revenues up with mid-single digits, with growth from all brands and geographies in our Jeanswear Americas business. As expected, profitability was hindered by exceptionally high raw material costs, and unit volume was impacted by price increases. Despite these challenges, our brands gained market share across all channels, mass, mid-tier and specialty.", "Top line growth, profitability in line with our expectations and market share gains in arguably the toughest cost environment we've ever seen. I am very proud of the performance we achieved in 2011 and more importantly, how well positioned we are for continued success in 2012.", "Now let's dig a little bit deeper. The Lee brand had a very strong year, with 8% growth in 2011. Our success was driven by new product innovation, such as the Lee Classic Fit and Premium Select lines, that helped drive our market share gains for this year. We have a very full agenda designed to drive solid top line growth, with new fit innovations in both men's and women's jeans and casual pants in mid-tier department stores. And speaking of mid-tier department stores, you'll recall that 2012 marks the launch of a new brand, Rock & Republic, as an exclusive with Kohl's in both men's and women's jeans. The launch takes place this weekend in all Kohl's stores and online. In fact, if you check out Kohl's website, you'll see that the product is already available. This launch will be supported by a major national advertising campaign, including Rock & Republic TV and print ads, plus an online and social media campaign.", "We're very excited about the long-term opportunity for this brand and another great example of our ability to identify and add compelling new brands to our portfolio and leverage them for success with our retail partners. Our Western Specialty business delivered 10% growth in 2011, led by continued momentum in our new and innovative Cowboy Cut, Western and women's fashion bottom styles. And in terms of our Mass business, having successfully navigated through pricing actions in the most price-sensitive channel of our Jeanswear business, the Mass Market, a flat revenue and performance in 2011 should be construed as a successful demonstration of our ability to manage our business well regardless of the environment.  Add on to that the fact that we gained market share in both our Wrangler and Riders by Lee brands, and you'll understand why we're proud of our performance this year.", "Internationally, we enjoyed another double-digit revenue growth quarter and year in all 3 of our major Americas geographies: Latin America, Mexico and Canada. Looking at 2012, we expect to see a strong year in our Jeanswear Americas business with solid top and bottom line growth and continued market share gains in all 3 of our businesses: Lee, Western Specialty and Mass.", "We're looking forward to revenue growth this year. However, 2012 is a tale of 2 halves. While the cost of denim purchases peaked in the second half of 2011, the negative impact will continue to work through our P&L in 2012. Accordingly, the first quarter of 2012 will be characterized by lower gross margins than the exceptionally strong first quarter of 2011, then we expect margins to stabilize in the second quarter and improve in the second half of 2012.", "Switching gears, I'll now touch briefly on our Imagewear results. I'm happy to report that with a revenue increase of 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the year, our Imagewear coalition passed the $1 billion threshold for the first time.", "Our protective apparel business, powered by the Bulwark brand, had an outstanding fourth quarter, which, along with Red Kap, drove our image -- or uniform business up nearly 20% revenues for the full year. In our Licensed Sports Group, we saw great results from our NFL business, which was up nearly 30%, contributing to a 6% increase in the overall Licensed Sports Group revenue for the full year.", "In terms of 2012, we are confident that we can maintain positive momentum in both businesses and are targeting a mid-single-digit growth rate for the Imagewear coalition revenues. Next, we have Karen Murray, who will take us through the Sportswear business.", "Karen Murray", "Thank you, Scott. Our Sportswear coalition, which consists of the Nautica brand and Kipling's U.S. business, performed very well in 2011, growing total revenues by 9%. Here's a quick recap of some highlights for both of these brands in the fourth quarter and full year, starting with Nautica. Nautica ended the year with revenues up 5%, including gains In our Sportswear license and outlet businesses. We've been working hard to evolve our product offering to a more differentiated, performance-based positioning around water, the core of the Nautica brand, and it's working, with our momentum building with our biggest retail partner and consumers. We're also telling our product stories more effectively, particularly online, with a new fully refreshed and integrated website. Our brand connection with consumers is strengthening as well. Our YouTube holiday ad generated over 1 million views. In addition, we saw a significant increase in Facebook fans in 2011, and most importantly, we are engaging with these fans and driving meaningful traffic to nautica.com.", "Nautica is truly a global brand, sold in over 75 countries and in 155 freestanding stores. Our international business is licensed, and the strength of the brand is evidenced by the 30% increase in international retail sales in our key markets in 2011 and over 1,200 points of sale. Nautica's outlet business continues its turnaround, ending the year with comps up at a mid-single-digit rate. The growth is due directly to successful test concepts we've executed at our highest volume locations, where we've worked to reset the consumer experience, updated our store navigation and appearance and most importantly, improved the store allocation process. We're looking forward to continuing this momentum in 2012.", "Now onto Kipling, a fast-growing and very profitable success story in the United States, particularly since we joined forces with Macy's as our exclusive department store partner for handbags in 2010. Kipling achieved 49% revenue growth in the quarter and 56% growth for the full year. We're currently in 420 Macy's doors. Additional door expansion in 2012 and increased penetration, coupled with a growing direct-to-consumer business, should fuel another year of exceptional growth for Kipling in the U.S.", " ", "To sum up, the Sportswear coalition is well positioned to grow revenues at a mid-single-digit rate in 2012, with gains in both our Nautica and Kipling brands, and we're planning improved profitability as we, too, begin to benefit from lower product costs.", "Now my colleague, Susan Kellogg, will take you through Contemporary Brands.", "Susan Kellogg", "Thanks, Karen. We're in the homestretch. Our Contemporary Brands coalition, which consists of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid, Ella Moss and John Varvatos, saw growth across all brands in the fourth quarter, with global revenues up 12% and full year revenues up 11%. We continue to improve the profitability of our coalition with positive operating comparisons in both the quarter and for the year.", "7 For All Mankind achieved mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in DTC business. In fact, our Americas business saw  mid-single-digit comp growth in our U.S. retail stores and nearly 30% increased  online revenue.  For the year, the brand continues to grow both in the U.S. and in Europe, fueled by DTC revenues that increased almost 40%.", "Looking forward to spring, be on the lookout for 7 For All Mankind's new ad campaign shot by Oscar-nominated actor James Franco. The campaign, which features both print and video, rolls out this week and really elevates our brand story to a uniquely fresh, California-inspired style. Together with future innovations in fit, fabric and finish, we're feeling great about 7 For All Mankind's brand outlook for 2012.", "Our Splendid and Ella Moss brands continued to experience tremendous growth, with fourth quarter and full year revenues each rising in excess of 20%. In 2011, wholesale revenues grew at a mid-teen rate, and our DTC business nearly doubled with the addition of 6 new stores and rapid growth in our e-com business. We're barely scratching the surface of this potential of these 2 brands, and we're excited about the outlook for 2012 as well.", "Innovation is what drives and it takes to win Contemporary, and we're driving more innovation than ever before across all of our brands, particularly with emphasis on color and fabric. Supported by marketing investments and continued DTC expansion in 2012, the global Contemporary Brands coalition is working and looking forward to a year of healthy, mid-single-digit growth combined with our substantial increase in profitability. And with that, we conclude today's comments and turn it back over to the operator to open up for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So, I might have missed it. Did you guys give  North Face and Vans bookings yet on the call?", "Unknown Executive", "What's the question?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Is that a question about fall 2012 bookings?", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I just wanted to see if we can get an update on what the bookings are for  North Face and Vans right now.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, well, we spoke about The North Face bookings for spring, which we did mention on our third quarter call, up 15% globally. But in case of fall, it's too early to call. We're very encouraged, but our teams are all actually in the field continuing to sell with our wholesale dealer partners. It's something we'd update you in our Q1 call.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Obviously, that was a volatile winter for those guys. Do you have any better visibility on Vans bookings for the fall yet?", "Steven E. Rendle", "No, we don't. They actually come in slightly later than our other business.", "Operator", "And for our next question, we go to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions around Timberland. The accretion for '12 is projected ahead of original plans, though the revenue outlook doesn't appear any more aggressive. Where is the incremental margin benefit that you're finding?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Jim, it's actually in a couple of places. In the gross margin as well as in the expense levels, you might notice that we're going to spend just a little bit more than we previously indicated, and of course, that's giving us nice benefits in terms of the operating margin. So we're seeing some stronger opportunities in the gross margin, and we're realizing those. And also, relative to the expense reduction, meaning SG&A reductions, we've seen a little bit more opportunity there as well. So it's really in both of those areas that's driving the improved profitability over our initial guidance.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And Timberland's clearly tracking quite well. It's a bigger acquisition than you've done in the past. At what point do you see the organization ready to take on another acquisition of any size? Can you guys, at this juncture, be a serious bidder for any properties that might come to market near term?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Jim, it's Eric, obviously, we have the capacity to be engaged right now in additional acquisition activities, both financial capacity and organization resource capacity. Something the size of Timberland, probably unlikely in the next 12 months. There aren't a lot of opportunities that are that big out there, but we remain active as always and continuing  relationships and discussions around future opportunities.", "Operator", "And we go next to Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just also wanted to ask about Timberland. I think there's a lot of opportunity for you to improve retail operating margins there. But I was wondering if that improvement is dependent on improving the apparel offering, so that really won't come until after 2013, or is there something that you can do in the meantime to improve profitability at retail?", "Steven E. Rendle", "You're absolutely right, Joe, that the serious improvement will come as we start to introduce apparel, but we do see opportunities to improve this year. In fact, we have a very talented team of both Timberland and VF outdoor retail expertise focused on our direct-to-consumer channel operationally, as well as looking to merchandising strategy to bring improvement in this year.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just ask some quick modeling questions, I was wondering if you could quantify the impact of the onetime charge in Jeanswear. Also, give your tax rate that you expect in 2012 and what your plan for marketing is as a percentage of sales.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, Joe. All in, the impact of that charge was -- really, the Jeanswear was 40 or 50 basis points. So again, it accounted for most of the difference in terms of what we guided toward. And the tax rate for 2012, 25% to 25.5% is what we're planning.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And your marketing?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Marketing spend should -- will stay relatively stable as a percent of overall revenues, which was right at about 5.7% in 2011, 5.7% of revenues.", "Operator", "For our next question, we go to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two quick questions. I was hoping Scott could talk about the average -- looking back at 2011, what the average ASP in Jeanswear looked like in both U.S. and Europe and then maybe thoughts on holding that as costs come down in the back half and into 2013. And the second question, I was hoping you guys could give a little more detail on the Vans outlook for 2012. Two things. Can you tell us how many doors you have in China and how many more doors you hope to add in 2012, or remind us that, and then the mix of growth for Vans in 2012, sort of China versus Europe versus U.S. I know there's a lot there, but I appreciate the help.", "Scott Baxter", "It's Scott. Robby, I'm going to go ahead and answer the first part of the first question, and then I'll have Karl Heinz address the European part of the question. But as expected, Robby, 2011 came in as expected and flow-through as expected. And 2012, we feel real good about our plans, feel real confident we're going to be able to hold our AURs. And we're seeing those trends all the way through January right now, and we feel real good about what's going on for the rest of the year. So as expected in '11 and feel good about '12.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And was it some sort of a single-digit or double-digit AUR increase?", "Scott Baxter", "Double-digit.", "Robert K. Shearer", "In 2011, you're saying?", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, on average, it was. It was right around 10% overall in the U.S. Jeans business, right.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then how did Europe look on that?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Jeans have price increases in Europe.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. Karl Heinz here, Robby. Jeans, we had some price increases in Europe in the lower, around mid-teens. On the second question, the China doors, we said we have about 1,700 doors, which we ended up in 2011, and we plan to open 500 -- around 550 doors, which would bring us to around 2,250. Now to put this in perspective, this is 2,200 doors with 4 main brands: The North Face, Vans, Kipling and our Jeans business. And if we benchmark that to what -- presence, is a meaningful presence in China, we see some competitors, large companies having around 5,000 to 6,000 doors.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Per brand.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Per brand, per single brand.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And can you give me just the Vans breakout on that?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "We did say in our announcement we expect Vans to grow about in the mid-teens for 2012.", "Operator", "And for our next question, we go to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Bob, let me start with you. In terms of your gross margin guidance for this year, up 70 basis points, a couple of things. Can you break that down by puts and takes in terms of what do you expect in terms of sort of basis point increases, decreases on costs, pricing, mix and FX? And then you've also said that you expect the improvement to come in the back half. Should I assume that means flat to down in the first half? And then I have a follow-up.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Okay, relative to the gross margin percentage, in terms of the puts and takes, I think is what you asked. What we're seeing there, Mitch, is just as we've been seeing over the past couple of years. Most of the improvement that we expect to see is from mix, right? So in 2011, we gained about 80 points from mix, and when I talk about mix, it's higher revenues in our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses. In retail, on the international side, becoming a bigger piece of the overall business. And  I referenced that in my comments. So again, most of that improvement comes from the mix side. Relative to cost and pricing, what we're seeing there, it's relatively neutral. It could be a little bit of upside from prices exceeding cost increases. Obviously, we're not looking for the same kind of cost increases that we saw in 2011, substantially less. But overall, relatively a neutral impact from pricing, net of costs. And the other question was?", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Gross margin first half versus second half.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Gross margin first half, second half. Clearly, what we'll see is in the first quarter, our gross margins, we expect still to be below the prior year's first quarter. I'd remind you there that in the first quarter of 2011, it was a really good quarter for us, and part of that was that we bought a lot of denim well in advance, right? So we carried low-cost denim into the early part of 2011, really benefited from that. So clearly, the toughest comparison will be in the first quarter of the year, and we do expect our gross margins to be down. It could be about 100 basis points. In the second quarter, we expect the gross margins then to flatten out. That's where we really see the stabilization. Third quarter, improvement, up obviously, and then the fourth quarter, more improvement over the third quarter.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up, on your sales outlook for the year, 8% constant dollar or 6% reported dollar growth, again, can you talk a little bit how you expect that to play out first half, second half? Should I assume maybe stronger growth on a year-over-year basis, percentage-wise, in the first half or at least better visibility on that first half growth at this point, not knowing how your prebooks are coming in for fall just yet?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Not really. Actually, first half versus second half, and of course, I'll speak to the core business, right, Timberland is a different story for the subperiod. But speaking to the core business, actually, first half, second half, we expect the top line growth to be relatively even, maybe a little stronger in the second half but not a lot stronger. But the point is what's happening here is that as our business -- especially with Timberland and the growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, the seasonality of our business continues to change. So the first half is becoming a little bit less than it has been in the past, and that's particularly so with Timberland, as you probably know. The second quarter, for example, in Timberland is less than 15% of their total year. So again, all of that impacts the overall seasonality.", "Operator", "We go next to Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wondered, Steve, if you could walk us through a little bit with what has been done with the Timberland brand so far in the U.S. I wondered if there had been a notable increase in distribution of some of the smaller brands like nonathletic and Earthkeepers so far, or is that still yet to come in 2012?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure, Kate. From a product distribution, the classics part of the Timberland merchandise mix continues to be important, but the major, major emphasis previous and now within VF is the Earthkeepers collection and what that means, not just to the footwear product but to the overall brand and its brand strategy. I will tell you there's a heightened focus on our wholesale/retail partnerships. The team has been extremely diligent over the last couple of months, meeting with and beginning to update and set strategies in motion to start to drive growth not only this year but to build the base for the years to come.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And the operating margin you reported for Timberland of 9%, was this for the year or the quarter? And whatever the case, I'm just wondering if you could, again, highlight what the pressure was on the operating income margin this year versus last year despite some of the synergies.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, the 9% for Timberland, Kate, was in the fourth quarter. And by the way, that's adjusted for the onetime costs. So it was only the quarter. On a full year, it was stronger than that, including the subperiod or the short period in the month of September. Overall there, on a full year basis, it was more like 12%, again, adjusted. In terms of the pressures on the margin, costs, just as we've been seeing in our businesses, product cost increases created some challenges to the Timberland team in 2011, for sure. So not really so different.", "Operator", "We go next to John Kernan with Cowen and Company.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you could quantify the net unit growth for Timberland in terms of retail next year. I think in the press release, it said half of the 130 stores would be from Timberland. And then the geographic mix of that square footage growth for Timberland.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Actually, John, we don't break out our store growth targets by brand. We did say that of the 130 stores next year, over half of them are coming from our Outdoor & Action Sports brands combined globally, but we haven't in the past and don't give, by brand, store numbers. Sorry.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. A little bit more on capital allocation next year. Obviously, the CapEx is coming in a little bit higher than we expected due to some headquarters and DC growth. But can you give us a sense as to what, I guess, the balance sheet's going to look like? You paid off almost $900 million of commercial paper in Q4. How do we look in terms of share repurchases?  It sounds like you're still open to making an acquisition. And then in terms of the -- more in terms of the balance sheet, what is your guidance for interest expense next year, or in 2012, I should say?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, that's a lot. Okay, I hope I hit them all. In terms of the balance sheet, commercial paper, the $280 million or so, at the end of the year, we'd expect to pay that down, obviously. We indicated in the release that we expect another year of very, very strong cash generation. So we'd pay the CP down. That would be our plan. In terms of the buyback that you asked about, we did not buy any shares back in 2011 because of the acquisition, but in 2012, we expect to resume our practice of offsetting the impact of option exercises. That would indicate buying back about 2 million shares. That's what's included in our plan on a full year basis. And the interest guidance for the year is about $90 million.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then one follow-up question. I think I heard Karl Heinz Salzburger say -- guides a 10% organic rev growth in Europe. What does that imply for organic growth in North America for the year, for 2012?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I mean, there's a lot of different factors there. We have Asia as well, but what we said overall was 8% in Europe. This is about 20% of our total business.", "Operator", "We go next to Robert Drbul with Barclays Capital.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess I want to focus on The North Face a little bit more, just on the outlook for The North Face. So I think you said mid-teens expectation for this year. Can you elaborate a little bit sort of in North America and Europe and the visibility around the expectations? I guess what I'm interested in is given the warm weather and the inventory levels at retail, just sort of what you're seeing on the order book and sort of how we should think about it geographically a little bit.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Robert, this is Steve Rendle. North Face America, specifically, mentioned that our spring order book globally was up in the mid-teens, and that absolutely holds true for here in the Americas. Our teams are currently in the process of collecting our fall order book. I mentioned that we're extremely encouraged. Yes, our outdoor industry is coming out of a very difficult fourth quarter. Specifically, December was down 2% from an industry sell-through standpoint. I can tell you that our North Face business was positive, and  was one of the leading brands from a sell-through standpoint in the industry. And as we've seen over the last few years, it's further consolidation around those brands that deliver very high product price value, and we're very confident what we will see for the balance of the year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, this is Karl Heinz. Let me start with Asia first. In Asia, we see The North Face as strong as ever. We're a little bit -- we have visibility on the fall bookings, and we can confirm that they will be as strong as we always had in the past. Europe is a little bit more different. Europe, there's a general trend in the market, as you mentioned before. We had a very late winter coming. We have a lot of snow now, but that caused a delay in the order intake process, not only for us but the entire industry. But we are confident to continue to grow in Europe as well based on strong spring bookings, and it's a little bit too early to say how fall would evolve. But again, the entire industry is a little bit later this year.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second question is on Timberland. I think, Bob, the original cost synergy number was $35 million, and I think that you originally said maybe $0.90 of accretion for '12, and this year, it's $1.10. Can you just give us an update in terms of the cost synergy side, sort of what's embedded in the accretion numbers that you've provided us today for 2012?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, sure, Bob. It's obviously more than that, right? So we've identified more opportunities. Remember, those are very early numbers, and you're exactly right. We indicated $35 million, and we're running at a rate that will be above that by $10 million or $15 million. So that is part of the increase in the accretion that you mentioned, the $1.10 versus the $0.90, as I said earlier on the call. Another factor, however, where we are seeing opportunity is in the gross margin area as well. It's a little more than we originally anticipated. Actually, in both areas, we're seeing some positive signs, and both are contributing to the higher accretion.", "Operator", "We go next to Omar Saad with the ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "To follow up on the Timberland discussion, you saw a little bit of the impact in the margin in the outdoor business, I think on the fact that Timberland is a lower-margin business. And I just wanted to kind of get your views. Is it structurally lower-margin business because it's footwear, or do you expect that, over the long-term, you should be able to get that Timberland margin up to more where  your corporate average is, obviously, is one of the best in the industry. And then I have a follow-up, too.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Omar, we committed to 15% operating margin on Timberland by 2015. What we also indicated, when we issued our initial guidance, we said that there was opportunity beyond that, to the 18% level, pretty specifically, is what we said. Just as we said when we did the acquisition, the point that I always made was we looked at the gross margin. The gross margins are really strong, and as I just said on an earlier response, we continue to see opportunities in those gross margins. And we think that, that really does speak a lot to the strength of the brand. So no, the answer is there are no inherent or fundamental areas of concern or differences that we see relative to the model for Timberland versus the rest of our outdoor businesses. Steve, anything to add there?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Omar, we do see opportunity over time, as the apparel launch comes live in fall 2013 and beyond, to see a benefit to getting a higher mix of apparel.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And Omar, if I may add, Timberland has a very strong retail presence in Europe and Asia, which will further also improve the gross margins.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I understand. And then could you also talk about -- I thought I heard a comment in the prepared remarks about changing the outdoor -- new outdoor headquarters in Europe and the U.S. Are you changing the way the business is -- operationally is organized and where the different brands are located?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "No, we're not changing where anybody is located or how the businesses are configured. As you would imagine, the buildings that we're in, we've been in the one in California for over a decade and the one in Lugano for 6 or 7 years, and we have outgrown that space. So it's simply -- it is a growth-driven need for more space. That's it.", "Operator", "We go next to Ken Stumphauzer with Sterne Agee.", "Kenneth M. Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "First, Bob, I just wanted to touch on 2Q. Timberland obviously suffers a loss in 2Q, and I'm wondering if you could help us think through the magnitude of what that could mean for VF as a corporation. Would it be safe to assume that kind of the organic or the core EBIT grows 10% and then you layer on the loss you typically see for Timberland, and as such, maybe earnings could be around $1? Or is that too negative of an assumption?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, I mean, it's just way too early to comment, Ken, on the second quarter. That's why we've kind of talked more about the first half. I can tell you this, though. I mean, you're absolutely on the right track relative to Timberland. You're right. I mean, historically, Timberland has incurred a loss in the second quarter of the year, and I've commented earlier on the seasonality of their business. So that obviously is going to be a hurdle for us. And could we be down quarter-over-quarter because of Timberland? Well, sure. It's a fairly significant amount. In 2011, for example, Timberland lost, I believe, $30 million-plus in the second quarter. So while we're improving the business and may not be quite there, still, that's a fairly significant hurdle for us in the second quarter.", "Kenneth M. Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Steve, I was just wondering if I could ask you about The North Face and kind of what 4Q could potentially mean for 1Q. It looks like you guys came out of 4Q with actually pretty clean inventories. Do you feel like that's the case at retail given the warm weather? And if that's not the case, is there the potential for sales in 1Q to be a little bit light given the lack of replenishment?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Ken, we have follow-up on some of the discussions we had at the outdoor retailer show.", "We did come through fourth quarter really well. We talked about the need to see cold weather arrive across the U.S. to start to drive that positive sell-through, and fortunately, it did come. We got cold weather. We didn't necessarily get cold, snowy weather, but with those colder temperatures, we have seen an increase in sell-through, giving us confidence for not only the quarter but for what that means for the full year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And Ken, we experienced a similar situation in Europe. Winter came -- it came late, but it helped us tremendously.", "Operator", "We go next to Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering -- it's really helpful to understand how you guys are thinking about the margin opportunity, long term, for Timberland. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market opportunity from a top line perspective. I think, Steve, you mentioned The North Face experience and the acquisition there, but clearly, Timberland is a much bigger business today than North Face was when you bought it. So I was wondering if you could help us with a little more detail on what kind of big opportunities you see to expand the top line over time. What are the big kind of holes in the business?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Absolutely. Michelle, from an Americas standpoint, and then Karl Heinz can fill you in on the international piece, the opportunities that we see, and we've been really forthright from the beginning, is to just continue to expand the distribution opportunities for footwear, first and foremost, building behind the Earthkeepers strategy that the brand has in place. We do see great opportunity with apparel. That's one of the synergies that we believe we will bring and be able to really help that team not only vision the apparel assortment but certainly produce it in a way that will be very positive. We see great opportunities with our direct-to-consumer channel, both the in-store experience, which will help us tell that brand story, which will certainly help expand the brand over time, but the digital aspect of the brand driving not only the content but the commerce piece. So I think it's a combination of those elements that we see driving growth over the long term.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, Michelle, it's very similar for us in Europe and Asia. I guess the only change is, we already have -- Timberland has a very well-developed apparel program, which is doing extremely well, especially in Asia, with a component between -- the ratio between apparel and footwear is nearly 50-50. So Earthkeepers in Europe resonates extremely well with consumers, and we are expanding that into more product categories, into apparel as well.", "Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And is there a benchmark kind of thing you point to, whether it's another brand or another business that says, hey, this is how big we think it can be, or is it just too kind of soon or too early in the strategy rollout to say that?", "Steven E. Rendle", "No, I think we see, Michelle, some real similarities to our North Face business, which is heavily weighted to the apparel and equipment side and the footwear growing. But we see an opportunity to tell a very clear outdoor message, maybe not to the same technical level of The North Face but absolutely building on that New England outdoor heritage and building both footwear and apparel through wholesale and direct-to-consumer.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to return the conference to Mr. Wiseman for any closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Just thank all of you for your time and your interest and your questions. 2011 was a record year for VF Corporation in just about every way. And as we approach 2012, we expect to do significantly better despite headwinds from pension and foreign currency translation and uncertain economic environment. We'll give you an update in about 90 days. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the VF Corporation First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana of ICR. Please go ahead.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for VF Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Group Presidents, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. In the midst of continued economic challenges and uncertainty both here and abroad, VF's record revenues and earnings demonstrate the strength of our highly diversified business model, the power of our brand portfolio and the ability of our people to succeed in any environment.", "Total revenue growth of 31% in the quarter with organic growth of 12% continues to outpace our long-term annual revenue growth target of 10% and gives us complete confidence in our ability to achieve our goal of 15% growth in total revenues for the full year. During the quarter, each VF coalition achieved strong revenue gains with double-digit growth on a constant currency basis in every coalition. And with the exception of Jeanswear, where we expect to continue facing higher product costs in the first half of 2012, our coalitions posted double-digit gains in operating income and solid operating margin expansion.", "So with 1 quarter behind us and 3 to go, thought I'd take a minute to recap our key strategic priorities for 2012, which are obviously aligned to VF's fixed growth drivers. First and foremost, building lifestyle brands. In 2012, this means maintaining the momentum in our fastest-growing business, Outdoor & Action Sports and continuing to empower our other brands to grow and reach their full potential globally. We'll leverage our consumer insight, marketing and product development capabilities to strengthen consumer loyalty for all our brands. And this year, making Timberland work for our shareholders by growing revenues and improving profitability is a particularly important focus. We're really excited about the progress we're making there, which you'll hear more about from Steve and Karl Heinz.", "Second, growing internationally. Here, the focus is investing behind our strong momentum in Asia and navigating through increasingly difficult conditions in Europe. Our business in Europe grew strongly in the first quarter as our marketing investments continue to fuel growth in our biggest and most profitable brands. We do expect double-digit revenue growth in Europe, although slightly below last year's 16% constant currency rate, given conditions there. But the power and authenticity of our brands, combined with generally low market penetration in many European markets, gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to grow both near and longer term. In fact, this year, VF should see 37% of revenues coming from international markets.", "With respect to Asia, we recognize there are concerns around slowing growth, particularly in China. But for VF, the story is really just beginning there as we've only invested in a small slice of VF's brand portfolio in China and in the region. To date, we've built just 4 platforms for growth there: Jeanswear, primarily with Lee; Outdoor with The North Face; Action Sports with Vans; and handbags and accessories with Kipling. We have many more opportunities in the region, and capturing these opportunities will be a significant factor in achieving our goal of 40% of revenues from international by 2015.", "Third, serving consumers directly through our growing base of retail and online stores. This year, we will open more than 110 stores across our brands, with the largest number planned for Vans, Timberland and The North Face. 15% growth in our direct-to-consumer revenues this year should help drive those revenues to greater than 20% of our total revenues in 2012, marking another year of progress towards our goal of 22%.", "Our fourth growth driver is to win with winning retailers. 80% of our business comes from our wholesale partners. So at the center of this strategy is aligning our brand, product and marketing strategies with those partners who can drive mutually beneficial and profitable growth.", "Fifth is to enable VF's future. We've nearly doubled in size over the past 5 years. To continue our momentum, we recognize the importance of consistent investments behind a best-in-class infrastructure, including talent development, supply chain capabilities and technology. In 2012, our capital expenditures will reach a record $375 million as we invest in such growth-supporting projects as new distribution centers, new coalition headquarters, technology and retail stores.", "Our sixth and newest growth driver announced in March 2011 is to lead in innovation. At VF, we have a simple definition of innovation. It's something new that creates value. Products, of course, are at the heart of our innovation agenda, from The North Face's Flash Dry fabric that provides unmatched moisture wicking to Timberland's anti-fatigue technology that gives all-day comfort, to patent-pending technology in Jeanswear that provides a superior fit for women, all of our brands are actively pursuing breakthroughs in product and process innovation. We obviously have a lot to get done this year. I am confident that we have the right strategies; the right focus; and most importantly, the right team to deliver another outstanding year to our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to our 3 Group Presidents. We're taking a slightly different tack this year in terms of their commentary, one that we hope will be more informative and efficient for you. Their content will focus solely on our 5 largest brands: The North Face, Timberland, Vans, Wrangler and Lee, which together comprise nearly 70% of VF's total revenues, providing a strategic overview of the domestic and international growth opportunities for each. Let's start with Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger, who will discuss our top Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Eric. Starting with VF's largest brand, The North Face. Global revenues were up 14% or 15% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, including a 20% plus increase in the brand's DtoC business. In our Americas geography, The North Face brand's revenues were up mid-teens, which along with solid international growth, puts us on track to meet our full-year goal of mid-teens revenue growth. So a great start to the year.", "To proactively address a couple of anticipated questions, I'd like to take a moment and comment on The North Face's inventory and backlog. On inventory, even though the balance of the winter selling season remained challenging and spring arrived earlier with warmer and drier conditions than normal, we have seen solid sell-through of seasonal products across the majority of our regions and channels. Looking out towards the fall, we are encouraged by our current global fall order book, which is up low double-digits to last year. And while we're certainly not immune to overall market dynamics, we are confident that The North Face is the best-positioned brand in the outdoor industry to manage through any environment.", "Okay. Now back to strategy. 2012 will be an exciting year for The North Face. With sales approaching $2 billion, we're hard at work executing a number of strategies designed not only to realize short-term growth, but also strengthen the brand's foundation and empower it to generate consistent growth for years to come. Taking a cue from Eric's list, The North Face key strategy in 2012 include delivering the most important, innovative outdoor products in the industry, leveraging our brand authenticity to connect more deeply with active consumers, providing a premium retail experience both in our owned stores and wholesale partners' locations and growing our international business.", "Let's start with product. Innovative product is critical for The North Face consumer, a consumer that is very knowledgeable and passionate about their sport and the products they require to perform at the highest level. They demand the world's best gear, so it's our job to continually push the boundaries of performance and deliver solutions for real-world challenges. Eric mentioned The North Face's Flash Dry technology. This is an excellent example of how our collaborative efforts with our world-class athletes yield product innovations that help redefine what is possible in fabric performance. As new technologies emerge, we continually assess our entire product line for opportunities to leverage more focused offerings.", "And in addition, in an effort to meet our consumer demand and better focus our presentation at retail, we're implementing a global product line rationalization program with the goal of reducing SKUs by 15% by fall 2013. This means industry-leading product for the consumer, a more succinct set of merchandise product collections at retail and enhanced margins.", "Next up is work to elevate The North Face brand's connection with consumers. Centered on bold, athlete-tested, expedition-proven storytelling campaigns, we continue to invest in expeditions and events that define our brand through the eyes of the hard core user. This year's story from the successful first ascent of Mount Meru's Shark's Fin, located in India's Himalayan region, will be the cornerstone of the brand's seasonal storytelling platform. The essence of the story lies in the Meru Kit, a collection of products built specifically for high-altitude, cold environments that was inspired and created by our amazing athletes and the Summit Series product team. And telling the story well is, of course, only a part of the equation.", "Our third strategy focuses on providing consumers the best possible retail experience wherever they shop, in our owned stores or with our wholesale partners. Retail is where we tell our athlete-generated stories and present our product in an environment that emotionally engages consumers. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities so that we can deliver and receive unique product, brand and consumer-generated content across a broad spectrum of innovative tools. In a few weeks, we'll be launching a new iPhone and Android-enabled app specifically geared at supporting our omni-channel efforts. The app will provide our consumers the capability to view system-wide inventory, upload and review product details through 2D and 3D scanning, as well as initiate a purchase transaction.", "The fourth strategy for The North Face brand in 2012 is growing our international business. So with that, I'll hand it over to Karl Heinz, who will take you through some highlights there.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve. Following a very strong performance in 2011, The North Face international business, which represents about 1/3 of global revenues, has continued its momentum in the quarter with high single-digit constant dollar growth in Europe and tremendous growth continuing in Asia.", "On the DtoC side, we launched The North Face websites in Italy and Spain, which now, along with the U.K., Sweden and France, brings our European e-commerce presence to 5 countries. We expect to launch a site for Ireland during the second quarter and Germany, Austria and the Netherlands in the second half of 2012. The North Face European e-commerce sites continue to outperform our expectations on all key performance indicators. We're truly excited to watch this business grow and to have country-specific vehicles to better connect and communicate with our consumers.", "On the wholesale side, we are pleased with our growth amidst an increasingly difficult environment. In Europe, winter arrived later than expected, and we saw concentrated sales in a short period of time in the first quarter. Looking at fall, as we anticipated, retailers are being cautious and are committing later to fall orders. That being said, we continue to gain market share and we keep a keen eye on market dynamics so that we can react as needed to future changes.", "For The North Face in Asia, our momentum is strong with a double-digit increase in the quarter. We have had very positive results from a new advertising campaign that launched there a few months ago. We're also testing a new retail concept that has great promise, have begun implementing an integrated digital communication plan. All of this continues to build the foundation for tremendous future growth.", "Now we move on to Vans. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. Coming off a terrific year in 2011, where we passed $1 billion in sales, Vans had yet another strong quarter with global revenues up 25% or 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency. In the Americas, revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in constant dollars. We are in very good shape to reach our full year goal of mid-teens growth.", "Our 4 main strategies for Vans in 2012 are similar to those at The North Face. Starting with innovation, our Vans product team, working with 4 of their top skate athletes, took 2 existing outsole technologies and combined them into a single patented WAFFLECUP outsole technology platform. Our new Stage 4 skate shoe is being debuted in stores and online this spring. This new innovation has reinforced that our Vans organization continues to be the leader in breakthrough technologies that exceed the expectations of their core skate consumer across the globe.", "In 2012, we will continue to elevate our connection with consumers by investing heavily in grassroots events like South by Southwest, numerous skate events and this summer's iconic Warped Tour. For all of these events, we're using social media in new and creative ways to link consumers back to the brand and interactively telling our story. In fact, our efforts have yielded a nearly 60% increase in Facebook fans and Twitter subscribers since the beginning of the year.", "Our Americas DtoC business continues to perform solidly. In the first quarter, Vans DtoC was up 13% including a nearly 40% increase in our e-commerce business. In both our wholesale and DtoC businesses, we continue to aggressively build the brand outside of the Western U.S., in Canada, Mexico and up and down the East Coast of the United States. To this end, we have opened 7 new stores since the beginning of the year, all primarily on the East Coast of the United States.", "We've scheduled an investor meeting in New York on June 14, where we'll go into much greater detail about Vans' overall business and long-term growth strategy. So now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some brief international highlights before we move onto Timberland.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In the first quarter, Vans saw tremendous growth of greater than 50% in Europe and high-teen revenue growth in Asia. We are clearly benefiting from higher brand investments, focusing on new products, strong emotional storytelling and focused skate culture events to connect deeply with our consumers. During the quarter, we opened 3 new owned retail locations, including a store on Camden Street in London, which showcases Vans' new retail concept, in 3 short weeks, become our second-best performing store in Europe.", "We're also excited about the simultaneous launch next month of 7 new e-commerce sites in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Austria and Sweden. We're clearly at the beginning stages with e-commerce in Europe, so you can understand why we are very bullish on our long-term growth opportunities in Europe with the Vans brand.", "And now let's take a look at Timberland. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "On a constant dollar basis, global revenues for Timberland were up modestly in the first quarter. In North America, revenues declined slightly due to unusually warm weather that dampened demand for Timberland's core winter boot business, as well as lower royalty income from the brand's former apparel licensee. The license was terminated last year.", "As Eric indicated, we are intensely focused this year on realizing the tremendous opportunities presented by the Timberland brand, growing revenues and improving profitability. Building on the strategies we laid out on our last call, we're focused on accelerating Timberland's product engine for maximum innovation, activating the brand to create a deeper consumer connection, assessing Timberland's wholesale distribution and DtoC and growing the business internationally. Timberland has a long-standing history of building quality footwear and we're looking to leverage this competency to develop a corporate innovation center that will serve both the Timberland and other footwear brands in the VF portfolio.", "Simultaneously, we're putting in place the team and infrastructure to support next year's apparel launch. We recently placed a leader from our North Face apparel business in Europe at Timberland to head up this important effort. We're fast developing a very clear vision of how to translate Timberland's unique heritage into apparel with special fabrics and features, which we look forward to sharing with you.", "We're also in the process of evaluating Timberland's DtoC strategy and operating model. We're making good progress in terms of rightsizing the cost structure and as well as in specific initiatives designed to drive traffic, improve conversion and improve margins. These efforts will better align Timberland's DtoC model with that of our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.", "Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to take you through what's going on internationally with Timberland.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's international business, which makes up more than 50% of total sales, saw low single-digit growth in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Asia on a constant dollar basis. Italy is Timberland's largest European market, and the challenging market conditions there are weighting on our overall results in Europe. But the overall strength of the Timberland brand makes us confident that we will weather these conditions and continue to grow and gain share in this important geography.", "To highlight a few strategic initiatives, on the product side, we are seeing excellent growth with our Earthkeepers and women's footwear. Both categories are starting to hit their stride, and we are confident that with continued marketing investments, they will establish themselves as even greater contributors to our overall performance this fall. In Asia, our strategic initiatives for Timberland are similar. Within this geography, we see opportunity for Timberland in multiple markets and are particularly excited about the upside in China, where we can leverage VF's existing infrastructure.", "Keeping our focus on our international business for the moment, let's now switch gears to Wrangler. On a global basis, first quarter revenues for the Wrangler brand were up 8% or 10% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. International highlights for the quarter was continued very strong growth in Asia, where revenues grew at a mid-teen rate in constant dollars. Perhaps not surprisingly, our business in Europe softened in the first quarter, leading to lower revenues there. Positive performance in Northern and Eastern Europe were not enough to offset challenging conditions in Southern Europe, especially in Spain, Greece and Italy. We were pleased, however, to achieve a nice improvement in gross margin and operating income.", "So in summary, a slightly lower top line for Wrangler in Europe with improved profitability. Strategically, we have a number of initiatives underway to position the Wrangler brand for long-term growth. This includes accelerating our efforts around product innovation, more powerful storytelling and new tools to help our wholesale partners communicate the brand's authenticity and heritage.", "With that, Scott will take you through Wrangler's performance in the Americas.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. In our Americas geography, Wrangler grew at a low double-digit rate in constant dollars, driven by strong performance in our Mass Market and Western businesses, pointing again to the success of new products and helped by the healthy sales of spring seasonal products. Product innovation tops the list of key strategic initiatives this year for Wrangler.", "On the mass side, we're seeing great results in our performance polo shirt and are looking forward to new fleece and easy-care shirt launches later this year. We're also very excited about the expansion of our Wrangler Five Star Premium line, and although early on, the Wrangler brand's extension into footwear.", "In our Western business, our product innovation efforts are targeted squarely at Western lifestyle consumers in both men's and women's. Examples include expanding our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut platform with shirts and a new Retro jean that will retail between $40 and $50 a pair in Western Specialty stores. DtoC is also an important growth engine for this business. In fact, our e-commerce business grew by 50% plus in the first quarter, and we're looking to develop a Wrangler Western partner store model. With 2 locations already opened, early reads are quite positive.", "And finally, let's take a look at the Lee brand. On a global basis, first quarter revenues were up 6% or 7% on a constant dollar basis. In the Americas, the Lee brand achieved low-teen revenue growth helped by strong seasonal sales. This performance contributed to market share gains in both jeans and total bottoms in the mid-tier department stores. Our ability to keep our products new and relevant, keeping the consumer at the center of everything we do by combining their feedback with our design expertise, is clearly working.", "On the men's side of the Lee business, new fit innovations like modern straight fit and motion comfort khaki are selling through strongly, and we're excited about the potential of our worry-free casual pants. Like Wrangler, we're also looking into opportunities to increase Lee's Premium offering to expand our brand's reach. On the women's side, we are seeing great momentum for our Shapetastic Perfect Fit [ph], an amazing slimming technology, and are very excited about the new product launches from Riders by Lee in mass stores later this year.", "All in all, a great start to the year with a tremendous amount of excitement and energy around the momentum we've built, the innovation that's coming and the opportunity to continue to grow this business. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Similar to Wrangler, Lee saw lower revenue in the first quarter in Europe while also improving profitability. In Asia, growth was at the high single-digit rate, which is lower than we have recently, due to entirely to the timing of shipments. We're looking forward to strong Q2 performance.", "On the product innovation front, Lee's women's stretch deluxe initiative continues to show promising results with high sell-through. We look forward to building on this initial success with a strengthening pipeline of innovative products to drive future growth. In the near term, we are very focused on execution of a variety of action plans to stimulate sell-through by managing inventories and expenses tightly to ensure we are in the best position possible relevant to the environment.", "Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights.", "Robert K. Shearer", "All right. Well, thanks, all, for the terrific overview. Now I'd like to wrap up today's call with some commentary around our first quarter financial performance and our strengthened full year guidance.", "Revenues were up a strong 31% or 32% in constant dollars. Similarly, our healthy organic revenue growth momentum continued in the quarter at 12% reported and 14% in constant dollars. In 2 of our very important growth drivers, international and direct-to-consumer, organic revenues grew by 15% and 16%, respectively, so we're tracking really well against the 2012 targets set in February for these businesses. Our revenue growth in the quarter was somewhat stronger than anticipated due in part to the unusually warm weather, which drove earlier shipments and stronger sales of seasonal products.", "Now a quick comment on 3 businesses that we haven't touched on: Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. All had very good quarters, with each double-digit top line growth and a healthy expansion in operating margins. A couple of details. Imagewear posted yet another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth. And as we've seen in past quarters, the momentum continues in the Image or the uniform side of the business, driven by 20% plus growth in both our Bulwark Protective Apparel and Red Kap uniform brands. And we also achieved another quarter of growth in the Licensed Sports Apparel business with particular strength in our Major League Baseball and NFL businesses.", "Regarding Sportswear, we really feel good about the strength we're seeing in both the Nautica and Kipling brands. Nautica's focus on differentiated products, supported by a powerful brand message, is clearly resonating with consumers with healthy increases in both its wholesale and retail businesses. Kipling in the U.S. also delivered exceptional retail growth in the quarter, over 50% in fact, with very strong comps. Wholesale revenues increased by over 25%, resulting in the 44% increase in total reported revenues.", "And in terms of our Contemporary Brands business, we really feel we're turning the corner here. We saw a big improvement in operating margin, which increased 300 basis points in the quarter. We're experiencing a nice pickup in our U.S. 7 For All Mankind business with 18% revenue growth. And we're continuing to open new stores for 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss. In fact, the Splendid and Ella Moss brands grew by over 20% in the quarter. And while these aren't VF's largest brands, they do present us with a significant opportunity for growth going forward.", "Now a few comments on gross margin. On our last call, I noted that gross margin could be down about 100 basis points. The reported gross margin was down 150 points. Let me provide some context. The gross margin for our core businesses, meaning excluding Timberland, was right on plan. And as planned, the decline was due to higher jeans product costs. However, gross margin for Timberland was lower than anticipated. We are taking aggressive actions to move cold-weather Timberland inventories, which given the exceptionally warm weather, is proving more challenging than expected. The good news is that these actions are working, and Timberland's inventories will be in much better shape by mid-year.", "As we discussed in February, we continue to anticipate significant gross margin improvement for our jeans businesses in the latter part of the year, and we expect to achieve the planned improvement in Timberland's gross margin in the second half. Finally, I'd also remind you that the overall gross margin comparison was impacted by a change in inventory accounting that took place in last year's first quarter, which benefited the gross margin in that period by 40 basis points.", "Our SG&A ratio is trending pretty stable with last year's level, up just 20 basis points. And that's despite the fact that this year's ratio includes, first, the impact of Timberland, where SG&A as a percent of revenues is significantly higher than VF's. In fact, Timberland drove up VF's overall SG&A ratio by about 100 basis points. And second, a 30 basis point negative impact from the higher pension expense. So that points to very disciplined overall expense control during the quarter.", "Our operating margin was 12.5% on an adjusted basis, compared with 14% in last year's first quarter. But here again, we have some puts and takes. Timberland negatively impacted the operating margin by 100 basis points. And of course, the current year's quarter includes the 30 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense. And finally, in last year's first quarter, the 40 basis point benefit from the inventory accounting change impacts the comparison. So on an apples-to-apples basis and excluding Timberland, the operating margin was actually pretty comparable to the very strong 14% achieved last year.", "Now you'll note the tax rate increased in the quarter to 26.7% from 21.9%, but I'll remind you that last year's low rate reflected a favorable tax settlement that lowered the rate by about 300 basis points.", "And that brings us to the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share rising by 7% to $1.94. Timberland contributed $0.12 to earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related expenses that were $0.03 per share in the quarter. Now it's important to understand the factors behind this quarter's earnings comparison. Included in the $1.94 was the combined negative impact from foreign currency translation and pension expense, which pulled EPS down by $0.09 per share. On the other hand, EPS in last year's quarter benefited by $0.11 in unusual items, which were the LIFO inventory accounting change and the favorable tax settlement. So excluding these unusuals, the year-over-year positive swing in earnings was actually $0.32 per share, underscoring our strong fundamental performance.", "Turning now to the balance sheet. Inventories are in really good shape, up only 7% excluding Timberland, with 6 percentage points of the increase coming from higher product costs. We did repurchase 2 million shares during the quarter for $300 million to help offset the dilutive impact of stock option exercises. We continue to anticipate another strong year of cash generation, which we now expect to exceed $1.1 billion for the year.", "Now I'd like to close with a recap of our revised earnings guidance, including a few comments on the second quarter. We're really pleased to be raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $9.45, up from the $9.30 we provided back in February. This increase is primarily driven by our great confidence in our brands' continued momentum. The increase also includes the $0.06 improvement from a smaller-than-anticipated negative impact from foreign currency.", "We remain comfortable with our assumption for an EPS contribution of $1.10 from Timberland, excluding acquisition expenses. So no change there. No change either in the $0.19 per share impact from higher pension expense. And the full year impact from foreign currency now moves to $0.35 from $0.41 per share. We noted in the release the 1.30 euro conversion rate for the second quarter and the 1.25 rate we're assuming for the second half. So the full year currency impact only changes by $0.06 from our prior guidance, as the change in the assumed rate from 1.25 to 1.30 for the second quarter has only about $0.01 of benefit to that quarter, given that Q2 is a seasonally low quarter of activity for our international businesses. Of course, if the euro remains at its current rate, there is upside to our guidance. To quantify that, in the second half of the year, there's about $0.10 of EPS benefit for every $0.05 movement in the euro-to-dollar relationship.", "Now a final comment on adjusted earnings per share. As we indicated in the release, adjusted EPS will now exclude not only the Timberland acquisition-related expenses currently estimated at $0.23 per share. But looking forward, we'll also exclude the gain anticipated from the John Varvatos sale, which is expected to approximate $0.20 per share. Coincidently, these 2 items nearly offset each other, so there will likely not be a significant difference between adjusted and reported EPS on full year reporting.", "With respect to gross margin, we remain comfortable with our guidance for a 70 basis point improvement for the full year. Gross margin comparisons will continue to improve in the second quarter and should turn nicely positive in the second half, with by far the strongest comparison in the fourth quarter. In terms of revenues, our guidance remains intact with that provided back in February, which called for a 15% increase in total revenues. And we're holding guidance despite the fact that we're now taking out $70 million in John Varvatos revenues for the balance of the year. We're still cautious about the macro environment both here and abroad, given the mixed economic data that we're seeing, so we think it's prudent to wait and get another quarter or 2 under our belts before we consider taking a stronger stand on revenues.", "Now as you know, we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance, but we did think more color was necessary around what we expect for the second quarter, particularly given the impact of Timberland on the numbers. On our February call, I said that the second quarter would be our most challenged earnings comparison. Let's review the reasons why. The first is the impact from Timberland, which historically posts a significant loss in the second quarter. This year will be no expectation, and we expect a loss comparable to what they reported last year of about $30 million on an adjusted basis. Timberland is now clearly our most seasonal business. And with that, VF now has a new earnings cadence. That loss will impact earnings by about $0.20 per share in the second quarter.", "And it's important to keep in mind as well the impacts from foreign currency and higher pension expense, which together are expected to be comparable to that in the first quarter or $0.09. So we're looking at a combined impact from Timberland, pension and currency on the second quarter that should approximate $0.29 per share. Comparisons are further challenged by the fact that last year's second quarter included a $0.07 benefit from a European plant closing. In short, despite continued growth in our core business, given these factors, we're looking at a decrease in second quarter earnings per share.", "And of course, given our full year earnings guidance, this points to very strong earnings gains in the second half of the year. We expect the fourth quarter to post by far the most positive earnings comparison of the year, given the rebound in our Jeanswear, and therefore total VF margins; strong retail revenue performance, as we continue to add new stores; and the seasonal nature of our biggest and most profitable Outdoor & Action Sports brands.", "Well, I hope this helps clarify the cadence of our upcoming earnings. In summary, we're off to a very strong start to 2012. We're seeing strong momentum continue. Our brands are in great shape. And as you've heard, we have a long runway for continued growth globally.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. Operator, we're now going to open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Drbul with Barclays.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First question that I have is on the outlook for the full year. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the way that you guys are positioned around the orders and open to buy throughout Europe? And just sort of are there any stretches to what you're assuming in that? Or where is there any risk that you see around the plans for the European business, specifically Vans and The North Face?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Karl Heinz, do you want to take a shot at that?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, yes, I do. As we had said in the release before, we had expected a little bit softer bookings, fall bookings, which is what actually happened. Having said still that, we still expect The North Face to grow in the full year. I mean, this is a firm statement. On Vans, Vans operates a little bit on a different business model than The North Face. We have multiple collections, so we had to work on 4, rather than 2. And so we don't have the full visibility yet on the full fall and back-to-school looks. But what we have at the moment, we said, we experienced a 50% growth in the first quarter makes us very confident that we'll have again, after last year, a very strong year on Vans. Did I answer you?", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful, yes. And I think you said The North Face, the global fall bookings were up low double. Is there a big discrepancy? Can you just give us any numbers around the U.S. versus the international order book on that one?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Karl Heinz, do we want to split this one?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, yes, I can start maybe with my part, which is Europe and Asia. We saw very strong numbers in Asia, which were -- they mirror historical numbers. So we mentioned double-digit up, very strong numbers. Europe was a little bit softer and we had a few exceptional items, not only the economy, which everybody knows about, and the bad weather, which really didn't help the business. But we also saw, particularly in the U.K., we had some major customers who had some bankruptcies, which affected us. Now this has been resolved. And if you neutralize these extraordinary events, we also pulled out from distribution which we didn't believe was good short-term and long-term for the brand. So if you neutralize these extraordinary factors, we still see a few percent of growth also in Europe.", "Steven E. Rendle", "And so, Bob, in the Americas, we don't -- we're actually seeing fall bookings comparable to prior seasons. So we're really on a nice trend. And in fact, as you heard, there's no change to our full year expectations of mid-teen growth for the brand on a global basis. I think it really speaks to the brand's diversified strategy, both from a region standpoint as well as the activities-based model that was deployed 3, 3.5 years ago, as well as the different categories of business that we sell into retail.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And, Bob, the other piece is Asia, where the brand is really strong in Asia and also very new in Asia. So we've got nothing but opportunity there. And our teams are capitalizing on the opportunity.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I'm just -- I'm curious about your comments that there was a bit of a gross margin tail -- sorry, headwind due to Timberland inventories being a bit of a challenge. But you didn't see a similar thing materialize for The North Face, yet we have -- yet it sounds like you're planning on doing some clearing of low-productivity SKUs for The North Face at the same time. So I was just hoping you could help us reconcile that as far as how we're thinking about -- it sounds like you have a lot of confidence in the second half earnings. That's usually very closely tied to The North Face. We're trying to think about a little bit -- how much -- how conservative we are or how much risk there is to the back half potentially from inventories for North Face in the channel still that might show up from last year from the warm winter.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. So this is Steve. So on The North Face, I'll deal with that first. We saw a really strong close to 2011, where we moved through the standard seasonal inventories at that point. And as we came into the first quarter, we saw solid growth of the seasonal categories as well. We -- I think from a brand standpoint, we've seen really good sell-through. Inventories at retail are in good positions. There are some retailers that are sitting on slightly higher but from our standpoint, we've seen such good sell-through here that we feel we're in the best position as we move into the second half. And our fall bookings would give us that confidence. And I think it's important to say that retailers book sales for coming seasons based on prior season sales, not necessarily prior season bookings or receipts, but on what they sold through. And our future bookings in fall really reinforce how well we've done in the first quarter and how we expect to enter into the second half. In the case of Timberland, we are still learning what it means to own a business that's primarily a winter boot brand. The impacts of the warm, dry winter were somewhat greater than we expected. That has left us with a slightly higher inventory position now. But as Bob mentioned, we will work our way through that by the end of the second quarter. But I think it also is important to say that this really reinforces our long-term strategy to accelerate innovation in both footwear and apparel, to build a business that has a more diversified assortment, not only in the fall but year around.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And Michael, I'd just add to that, that obviously right now we're instilling a lot of discipline, especially in the inventory management area at Timberland, and we're seeing a little bit of short-term impact from that. But we're going to see big benefits going forward as we get the inventory levels down, which are quite high right now, and as we work those down by mid-year and then move forward in the second half of the year.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And, Michael, it's Eric. Just to make sure there's clarity about the situation in North America with The North Face, yes, we did have a few retailers that put some inventory back to hold onto it to sell until fall. All of that is reflected in their bookings. They obviously wrote their bookings knowing exactly what they had. And so our outlook for the fall, we have pretty clear visibility to the outlook, and we're really encouraged.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just since we're going to be -- I think the next time we'll chat with you guys will be at a Vans Analyst Day, maybe a Vans question. I think we heard that you guys are -- you have the e-commerce platform set up in Europe now. And I think it becomes quite leveragable that you have the back-of-house supply chain and order fulfillment set up. And I think you're going to be turning on quite a few markets for Vans now that you have North Face on in the near term. Can you tell us a little about the plans for Vans as you roll that out across Europe on e-commerce and perhaps what you're seeing early on with North Face, so we could think about, as you do that for Vans?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Go ahead, Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. Michael, you said it all, right? We do work and we have a leverage on our, what we call the backend on e-comm. We started about 15 months ago with the first trial market on The North Face. And what we do now, we are rolling out other markets and brands. We use the backend, which includes not only the system part but also the order fulfillment and the deliveries, the supply chain. It's all backed and it's leveraged. Well, what we do keep in focus though is the brand part. So every site has its relevant part, so it could speak to their relevant consumers. We don't know yet what is going to happen on Vans because we mentioned we are rolling it out next month. But I did mention that in my script, the experience we had on The North Face. Once we improved the first initial difficulties, it's great. And it's much over what we had planned and what our expectations were. It's a very fast, rapidly growing channel.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "For us, that's all upside in Europe around the e-commerce thing. This will not come as a surprise to you: we've been pretty conservative in our expectations this year as we start launching the Vans e-commerce sites in Europe. But it's all upside and the right thing for us to be doing.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "All right. And just one last question, and I'll let you guys run. But since we're on the topic of field trips, we're going to China. You guys are taking investors to China in September. Why now? Why is now the right time? You guys have been there for decades. It's a single-digit part of the revenues. But I'm just curious, is there an inflection point ahead? Or why is now the time to showcase what you -- the work you guys have done in China?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Well, we've been thinking about when was the right time to go to Asia and talk about our Asian business and our focus on China in particular. And Timberland was actually an inflection point because they're so successful in that region that we thought now was the right time to go over and talk about our Asia-Pacific business and share with you just how much progress we're making. We're getting very close to that $1 billion mark in the region. And we thought that was something to talk about and show you how we're doing that, centered, of course, our biggest market is China, but wanted to share all that with you. So looking forward to that trip in September.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. If you mentioned what you're seeing from Timberland orders for fall, I missed it. Can you share some perspective on this? And is the 10% annual growth objective for Timberland still a reasonable expectation for '12?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Jim, this is Steve. Timberland, similar to Vans in Karl Heinz's earlier answer, operates on a different model than The North Face, so we don't currently have a full season visibility into what that fall season looks like. But we are confident that our expectations of Timberland adding $1 billion in revenue to 2012 is well on track to come together.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And Jim, Eric. When we talked last quarter about the 2012 outlook for Timberland, we mentioned that it would be low single-digit revenue growth. As we cleaned up some distribution, closed some underproductive owned stores and we exited the apparel business in the United States, we're positioning long term. 10% annual growth is still our target. But our specific reference to this year's Timberland organic revenue growth number was in the low single-digit range.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And Jim, the other -- yes, the other reconciling item there is currency, right? So from the 10% currency as well as the exiting of some business, that's how we got down to the single digits.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got you. That's helpful clarification. And then a question on the Jeanswear business for Scott. So competitors have made some pricing adjustments recently. Has that had any detectable influence on Lee or Wrangler's sell-through share in recent months?", "Scott H. Baxter", "No, Jim, it hasn't. And our intention is try to hold pricing and keep it where it's at. Now if you remember, our last couple of calls, Jim, we've talked a lot about the fact that we didn't go up as far as the pricing went up and as far as the cost went up. We stayed fairly neutral, only went up about half. But as we look at the business and we look with our customers to work with them, we'll be fair and we'll work with our customers to make sure we maximize the business going forward. But right now, our intention is to stay pat.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And a quick follow-up to Mike Binetti's question. When you talk about the 15% SKU rationalization, that isn't liquidation but it's assortment planning for future seasons, correct?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Exactly, Jim. That's all about rightsizing our collections to really maximize our output and our creativity and also improve margins from that exercise.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just wondered if we could have a little bit more detail around the outlook for the year and where the $0.15 is coming from. Obviously, there was some contribution from better-than-expected currency. But I wondered if you could help us understand the additional $0.10 upside since revenue guidance is staying the same.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure. I'll start on that one. So Kate, it is important to factor in the John Varvatos piece. So what happens is we had John Varvatos business obviously built into our initial projections. We'll lose about $70 million of revenues by the sale, but not a lot profit, right? So there's not a big impact there. So what that means is if we're taking $70 million out of revenues, it means that we're feeling more comfortable with the rest of our businesses, some increase in the rest of our businesses and seeing some pickup there in terms of the additional or the incremental EPS contribution.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then with regards to margin contribution then for the rest of the year, are there any areas for where there could be more upside with regards to gross margin than maybe -- than you were originally expecting, either on the cost side or on -- from pricing?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. We're pretty well locked in right now. Based on prior conversations, we're in a very different place today than we've been in the past and particularly on -- or at least last year, and particularly on the denim side, right? So we're pretty well locked in right now on the cost side. And that is true both from a sourced goods standpoint, as well as our denim buys. So we're covering at this point in time at least through the end of the third quarter and about half of the fourth quarter. So we have a very, very good picture in terms of what those costs will be. And on the revenue side, I think you mentioned pricing. I mean, pricing as well, I think the question has been around the Jeanswear side, particularly here in the U.S. And as Scott just said, our intent is to hold our pricing there. But it's really important to keep in mind that our pricing increases only covered half of the cost increases. So once again, we feel very confident about our assumptions there.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I guess, if I could follow up on the Jeanswear business. Clearly, the combination of pricing and product costs rolling over are going to help domestically. Maybe, Karl Heinz, a little bit more color on the European business. Remind us what Jeanswear represents for that region and sort of the visibility as you go forward through the balance of the year, what top line trends looks like there.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Sure. Let me just do some math in my head. Jeanswear, our largest business in Europe as well as the Outdoor business. I think Jeanswear represents about 20% of our total business in Europe. And we said it before. We had expected a little bit slower bookings for fall, which actually happened. Where we see some pressure is on the replenishment. Jeanswear operates a little bit different business model than Outdoor, where the replenishment side is higher than in Outdoor. And we basically see the same trend. Our customers, primarily the department stores, are suffering from lower traffic. And we see that reflected in the replenishment then. So the bookings came in as we had expected. They were slightly up in spring, and they were a little bit lower -- I mean, they are a few percent down versus last year in fall. But what we have worked on very highly was the improvement in gross margin and in the profitability of our Jeanswear business. And that's what's happening at the moment.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And, Eric, it's the other Eric here. I'll add to Karl Heinz's comment and remind you that when you look at the international business for Jeanswear, you have to look at China and India. Our biggest business in China is our jeans business and our biggest business in India is our jeans business. And our jeans business in China is more profitable than any jeans business we have anywhere in the world. So our Asian growth in Jeanswear is a really important part of our story. And I'm sure we'll be talking about that in September. Hope you can join us.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, no, that's great. And then really just quick follow-up. I realize it's a smaller piece of the business, but certainly the opportunity for growth, and it sounds like turning contemporary, be it 7 For All Mankind or the Ella and Splendid businesses. Maybe just touch on, what are the kind of key drivers there? Is it wholesale versus direct for 7 For All Mankind? Sort of what's driving that? And where do you see the opportunities over the next 12 months?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. I'll start with talking about the Splendid and Ella Moss business, which we don't often talk about. And Bob commented, I think, in his comments, it was up 20% in the quarter. That's not new news for us. Actually, it's been kind of growing that way for the last couple of years. That is a very -- those are very strong brands, very relevant to their consumers, mostly a U.S. business for us now with international opportunity. Mostly U.S. business, and that kind of growth is not new. They've been very disciplined there about delivering strong double-digit growth quarter after quarter after quarter. 7, as you know, was a business where we went backwards during -- particularly during the recession, when the premium business in general slowed down. And that team has been working very hard to make sure they have the right product and the right mix in their wholesale and retail business. And both grew. Both the wholesale and retail business were up. And as Bob said, I think, in his comments, the brand in the U.S. was up 18% in the quarter. And we're thrilled to see that kind of traction. It began in the middle of last year, and it seems to be accelerating.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And is that primarily a wholesale function of picking up share? Or was this kind of greater driving from direct-to-consumer?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I can't -- well, it's both. Both were up double digits, right at around the 18% range in both. I can't comment on the share piece at wholesale because that space, the premium denim space, has been a good space for the last 6 or 9 months. But I don't know that we're gaining or losing share there, but we are having that kind of strong double-digit growth. I don't know what the total space is.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to John Kernan with Cowen.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to Timberland again. You talked a lot about long-term margin recovery in this business. Is there any way to improve the seasonality potentially in Timberland? Maybe looking out into next year, do you see any long-term leverage to kind of improve that seasonality from a profitability standpoint?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, I think -- John, this is Steve. Our opportunities at Timberland are to certainly strengthen the core footwear collection that Timberland's known for. But it's also to diversify that collection and look at growing the spring assortment, growing the men's and women's assortment. And it really is apparel, which we talked a lot about at the point of acquisition, the $300 million in incremental opportunity we see over the next 5 years. As we bring that online beginning fall 2013, we believe that we'll start to see that seasonality start to diversify similar to what we saw going on with The North Face back when we acquired it in the 2000.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then revenue growth in 2013, and kind of an inflection back towards that 10% growth. Aside from apparel, what other drivers do you have to kind of produce that growth? Is there DTC growth? Is there going to be new wholesale partner doors? Or what really gives us and you guys confidence in that 10% growth rate?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Our confidence on that 10% growth rate over the 5-year period is improving the assortments and the sell-through of the brand in our key wholesale partners. It's also the improvement of DtoC as we look to improve the contribution of our current stores, as we achieve that, adding new stores, and certainly the e-commerce component where we see such great significance in our North Face and Vans businesses, leveraging those learnings in that platform to help Timberland scale in that area as well.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "John, Karl Heinz here. I would add also geography, and I mentioned that in my section. We just started in China with Timberland, and where we can leverage the success story we're having with VF. And also Europe, the penetration in Europe, while it's a big, important market, there are still areas where we believe we can cover.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. If you don't mind me asking one more kind of macro-related question, there's been some cautiousness recently out of some other footwear and apparel companies regarding Europe. Have you seen any change in confidence in your consumers and retail partners there since the fourth quarter towards -- to more of a cautious outlook, I guess?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, we read a lot of about Europe. I guess, what we have seen or what we see is more and more a polarization between the southern part of Europe and the central and the northern part, which we all know about and read about the difficulties of the southern part, the 3 big large markets, without even touching Greece, but Spain, Italy. What we have seen though lately is a little bit of stabilization. We haven't seen these trends deteriorating. So I guess that's the good news. We have to see how it will evolve. But so far, the good news, even at the weaker market, we haven't seen a deterioration.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And what I find particularly encouraging about our European situation, last year, we grew 16% on a constant currency basis. And there was economic turmoil then. Would we expect to be a little bit below that this year? But part of that is because our brands are -- we have brands that are relatively underpenetrated in a lot of countries. And Karl Heinz and his team have managed to identify a path that will still give us double-digit growth in Western Europe. Despite all the changes and swings and roundabouts across our brand portfolio, the breadth of our portfolio and the differences in how each brand has penetrated in each market is really an advantage for us. It gives us a lot more opportunity.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Taposh Bari with Jefferies.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask you, I guess, Eric, on a follow-up to that last point. So it seems like you're doing a really good job of challenging -- or managing the macro challenges in Europe, and your brands are fairly underpenetrated there. I was hoping -- we got a glimpse of this at The North Face Analyst Day, I guess, last year. But I was hoping to get some more color on where you're seeing growth: if it's distribution, if it's door growth, or if it's just increased relevance amongst your brands.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Karl, you want...", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, it's multiple things, and some you touched on. Certainly, I mentioned about the e-comm initiatives, right? We are rolling out, as we speak, a new market. So that's one big initiative. The second one, still falling under direct-to-consumer, we are opening stores in The North Face, as we have mentioned before. And our number of stores today, a grand total of 40 stores, it's still significantly lower than even a sister company like Timberland. So that is an opportunity. If we benchmark the number of stores we have to some local competitors, we have a long way to go. So that's the second. The third one is simply geographies, right? The North Face had always had a pan-European strategy, and we are very rarely the #1 in the market. We have local competitors, but we are growing. So we are going on a pan-European basis, not just primarily in 1 or 2 markets. I guess, these 3 factors are helping us to see this continuous success we're having since many, many quarters.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. Can you just -- would you be able to just talk to the -- or the countries specifically? Like which countries do you feel like you're most underpenetrated in, in Europe today?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, we still have, compared to some other competitors, what we call the emerging market, which is that area from Russia, which is a big important market for Outdoor. Russia, going down to Turkey, covering Poland and the Czech Republic. But primarily these 3 big, large -- relatively large and healthy markets, that's important. They are growing. They are doing well. We are going also very nicely, higher than the average in the Scandinavian area, while on the other big markets like Germany, Italy, France, we still have people ahead of us. There's a German player which has nearly 150 doors, and we have probably 10 in Germany. So we still have, even in the big markets, some room to grow.", "Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just a final quick follow-up question for Bob. I don't know if I missed this, but can you tell us what Timberland's gross margins were in the first quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. We don't provide specific gross margins by brand. But what we can tell you is that for Timberland, the gross margin was right on the average. It was right on overall VF's average. Now again, we did expect it to be a little bit stronger than that, and we talked about why that was the case. But it was right on VF's overall average.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Eric, as you think about the portfolio management strategy for VF Corp., obviously with the addition of Timberland, the strong growth in the Outdoor & Action Sports segment, the increasing shift to a little bit more retail mix than wholesale mix, the business has become much -- is becoming much more seasonal, back-half-weighted. Are you comfortable with that? Do you feel like -- especially as you look out in the future and look to manage the portfolio, add brands, do you look to fill in kind of seasonally strong brands that would be -- that would offset kind of some of the way it's weighted now? Or are you comfortable with that, kind of building a really strong Outdoor business? If it's back half-weighted, it's back half-weighted. It's what we're good at. It's what we really know. Just your thoughts on the portfolio management and the seasonality of the business would be great.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes. Seasonality has not been a primary filter that we use as we look at the portfolio. We obviously are aware of it. And I would say that from an acquisition standpoint, which I think is the point of your question. We do look at, are there seasonal opportunities for us to strengthen businesses as we did with The North Face? And it's interesting to us that 12 years ago, we were talking about really difficult second quarters because The North Face was not a good business to be in, in the second quarter. But we've rounded out the product portfolio. We've rounded out the countries we sell the brand in. We've rounded out -- we have really good spring, summer products in The North Face. And that -- we weren't having that discussion for the last 2 or 3 years. And we have the exact same opportunity with Timberland. And as Steve said in his comments or the answer to one of his questions, apparel is really an important part of that solution for Timberland. And we won't be begin to -- we won't have a spring apparel line until the spring of 2014, so it's in our sights and we will get at it, but it will take us a while. But we haven't said, \"Well, let's go acquire a business that will make us stronger in the second quarter.\" We are very comfortable with -- if we're leading in these cold-weather brands, if we have the strongest cold-weather brands, we will continue to have good third and fourth quarters as we have for the last 5 or 6 years in a row.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And Omar, just I guess, I'd just add to that, that one of the challenges with businesses that have that highly seasonal nature is from an operational standpoint and managing inventories. And we've demonstrated that we can do that pretty well with brands like The North Face. It's exactly what we're working on right now in Timberland. And again, we'll make a lot of progress there.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great, great. And then one follow-up. On the kind of cost-inflation side, obviously, the cotton bubble seems to be behind us, so to speak. How are you guys thinking about inflation long-term? Yes, the material side may be getting easier, but we kind of all know about the structural wage story in China and emerging markets, where a lot of the manufacturing is done. How do you see VF in maybe a structurally inflationary environment, kind of especially once we get past the back half of this year? And how do you see that impacting the kind of overall marketplace if we really are going from 20 years of deflation to some extended period of inflation?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. And we, of course, enjoyed that period of time from a cost perspective. But right now, in a more stable environment, I guess, you might say, it feels to us like there's a few percentage points of inflationary cost that will come our way probably over some period of time here. That's what we're seeing this year. And as we look forward, we expect something more like that. And as you pointed out, with the cotton bubble, it appears to be behind us, a lot more stable environment. But a few percentage points of inflation on an annual basis could be expected.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And that's one of the reasons, Omar, that we are investing so heavily behind our brands and why we're so focused on our innovation strategy because we believe that if we build these brands to be the leaders in their space and if we have incredibly innovative products, that we can get paid for the products with the leading brands. And seeing this wave of inflation coming at us for years to come, we think that's critical to our solution. Fortunately, we think we're well positioned with both the brand and the product innovation fronts.", "Operator", "And with that being our last question, I'll turn the call back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional comments or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. Thanks for being with us today. As you've heard, the momentum of VF continues despite external economic challenges. We're really confident in our ability to deliver our increased 2012 guidance, and we look forward to giving you another update in July. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference. And we thank you for participating.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana. Please go ahead.", "Jean Fontana", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for VF Corporation's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. By now you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting today's call is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Wiseman", "Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 group Presidents: Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. We are now 3 quarters through the year, and I can say with confidence that 2012 will mark another year of outstanding performance for our shareholders. However, the economic news is decidedly mixed. We're seeing some slowing in the U.S. economy, increasingly challenging conditions in Europe and slowing growth in China.", "Against this backdrop, VF delivered another quarter of record revenues, margins and earnings. We raised our earnings guidance, increased our dividend payments for the 40th consecutive year and confirmed our expectation for all-time highs in revenues, earnings and cash flow. And we're looking forward to wrapping up the year on a very strong note with fourth quarter constant dollar revenue growth of 7% in the first fully comparable quarter with Timberland under VF's ownership and an increase in adjusted earnings per share of just over 30%.", "I'll take just a minute to comment on a few items I think are of most interest to all of you. First is VF's margin recovery story, which is playing out even better than we envisioned at the beginning of the year, and it's not all about product cost. We're seeing the continued benefit of the transformation of VF's portfolio toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses and geographies. Our profitability is strong and getting stronger, reinforcing our confidence in reaching the 15% long-term operating margin target we set last year.", "Our international performance story also remains healthy with solid growth in the quarter. In China with 23% growth this quarter and growth across all major brands, I think you will agree that our performance there has been exceptional. Having announced last month our new 5-year growth rate target of 21% through 2017 in China, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in this dynamic and increasingly important market for VF.", "In terms of Europe, no doubt that you noted the 3% constant dollar growth in our European revenues, which follows a long string of consistent double-digit growth. We said repeatedly that we're not immune to conditions there and that we expected our growth in Europe to moderate in the second half from what we saw in the first, so no real surprise to us here. The diversification provided by our brand portfolio continues to pay off with results that continue to trend above those of many of our competitors. In fact, we're looking at about 10% revenue growth in constant dollars in the fourth quarter, and we're again confirming today our expectations that our revenues in Europe will grow at a double-digit rate in constant dollars this year.", "With much of 2012 behind us, our attention and yours naturally turns to next year. The work we've done this year to build our brands, manage costs and inventories and expand internationally should pay off in the form of another strong year for VF. In fact, we've made the decision to increase our fourth quarter marketing investments over levels previously planned to ensure we continue to grow our market share and to build momentum for 2013.", "Uncertainty around world economic conditions will persist, but we've demonstrated that the VF model, build around diversity in brands, products, channels and geographies, is ideally suited to succeed regardless of the environment. Our portfolio of brands is as strong as it's ever been. We have many opportunities to grow around the world. We're investing to strengthen our core capabilities across the board, including product innovation, technology, supply chain, direct to consumer and sustainability, among others, to support an even bigger and more profitable VF in the future.", "And with that, I'm very pleased to turn the call over to Steve Rendle. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Eric. Third global revenues for the North Face were up 5% or 8% on a constant dollar basis, including a 10% increase in the brand's DtoC business. As a reminder, we had tough comps this quarter given the 22% growth rate in last year's third quarter. In addition, comparisons also reflect some movement in our order book from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And as we've noted in past calls, wholesale orders moved closer to need based on last year's warm winter. And coupled with challenging conditions in Europe, we're actually quite pleased with our results. As we noted last quarter, the fall order book is up low double digits on a global basis and is driven primarily by North America and Asia. We have great confidence that the business will accelerate in the fourth quarter to a mid-teen constant dollar revenue growth rate, positioning us to end the year strongly.", "In the Americas, the North Face brand third quarter revenues rose at a high single-digit rate driven by a solid sell-through in both wholesale and DtoC with particular strength in sales of lightweight outerwear, Sportswear and equipment product categories. Product innovation is at the core of what we do at the North Face. We've seen strong consumer response to our key fall product initiatives including Flash Dry apparel, which has been launched in more than 3,700 wholesale doors, as well as our DtoC channel where early reads are quite positive.", "Our Powder Guide ABS vest, the industry's first avalanche airbag apparel system, has won numerous awards and praise for product innovation from the likes of Outside Magazine and Popular Science. The North Face brand continues to build relevance in new product categories as well with our technical running, training and yoga lines gaining momentum, as we increase penetration in existing doors and expand into relevant new specialty doors.", "Our new product pipeline is robust, and we continue to raise the bar on product innovation for the entire outdoor industry. As Eric mentioned, due to our outstanding performance, we are incrementally increasing our fourth quarter marketing spend to capitalize on our momentum. This spend, which will be focused on 2 of our strongest brands, The North Face and Vans, will include greater grass roots and media activation efforts in our strongest market, the United States.", "In the fourth quarter for The North Face, we will launch our biggest technology-focused media campaign ever. The campaign, which will focus on Flash Dry, the ABS vest and key Summit Series products in 4 key U.S. markets, features TV radio and digital efforts geared at educating and inspiring consumers. We're also investing at retail both in our own stores and in those of key partners to drive traffic and improve conversion rates in this seasonally important period for the brand.", "And now here's Karl Heinz Salzburger to highlight The North Face's international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Starting with The North Face European business, as you know, macro conditions have continued to soften. In the third quarter, we saw mid single-digit constant dollar revenue decline in Europe driven by weakness in the wholesale channel, as retailers remained cautious and committed to orders later than usual.", "That said, The North Face brand continues to capture market share in Europe. We are confident that we are extremely well positioned to compete successfully even in today's difficult environment. Similar to our efforts in the Americas regions, we have high-profile events that continue to share our brand story and engage consumers.", "A huge highlight in the quarter at the end of August was the successful 10th edition of The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, an epic trail running expedition that was broadcast live with the launch of UTMB digital television. Our online presence in Europe also continued to expand with 33% growth in e-commerce sales in the third quarter. Launch of a new website in Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria brings our total e-commerce presence to 12 countries, and we are very well positioned to drive brand traffic for the fall and winter seasons.", "And consistent with U.S., we're also increasing our fourth quarter marketing investment over previously planned levels to ensure continued momentum for The North Face and Vans brands. In Europe, we will increase our efforts for Vans in the U.K. and Benelux, The North Face in Germany and in China for both brands.", "Turning to Asia. We continue to see excellent momentum for The North Face brand with constant dollar revenues up by more than 60%, driven primarily by outstanding growth in China where Outdoor category growth remains very strong. We also doubled our distributor business in the quarter, driven by growth in Taiwan, Australia and Singapore. Our efforts continue to be focused on building brand awareness and engaging consumers around the outdoors. For example, we have established an outdoor training school with a top Chinese athlete with the goal of training 5,000 outdoor enthusiasts in 5 years. In September, we launched a new digital outdoor ecosystem on jabba.com [ph] reaching 40,000 consumers daily in the just first 2 weeks. And in the fourth quarter, we're launching a \"turn winter upside down\" marketing campaign with a focus on Summit Series outerwear.", "Now let's move onto Vans. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Global revenues for Vans during third quarter were up 21% or 26% excluding the impact of foreign currency. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our 4 key growth drivers: product innovation, consumer connectivity, DtoC growth and geographic expansion.", "Starting with our performance in the Americas region, third quarter revenues were up at a mid-teens rate in constant dollars driven by balanced wholesale and DtoC growth. We continue to excel on the consumer connectivity front as well. The 18th Vans Warped Tour wrapped up here in the United States and was once again a tremendous success at connecting the brand with its core consumer through music, social media and philanthropic efforts relevant to their youth culture.", "And our Vans House Parties concert series held at the House of Vans in Brooklyn, New York did an amazing job at continuing to put the brand on the map in the greater New York Metro region, the epicenter of our strategy to grow the brand in the Northeast. On the product front, our van Doren and swim classics lines are resonating well with men and women, respectively, and in fact, we're seeing renewed strength in classics across the board. And although still early, our Vans LXVI collection, which launched globally in late June is gaining traction across key wholesale partners and our own stores.", "And similar to The North Face, we've made the decision to increase our fourth quarter global marketing investment over previously expected levels around the Vans brands to capitalize on the momentum we've created to ensure a strong 2013. In the fourth quarter, we will focus our marketing efforts at building awareness for the Vans LXVI collection and specific tactics to help drive sell-through in both our own and U.S. dealer doors. Our Vans campaign will center on TV, print and digital advertising to connect with our target consumer and to drive traffic and conversion at our own stores and key mall partners. We will focus our investments on targeted in-mall and radio advertising.", "Now I'll pass over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some international highlights.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In the third quarter, Vans continued its outstanding momentum in Europe with constant dollar growth of more than 45% versus the same period of 2011. All markets and categories were up significantly in the quarter with exceptional strength in Northern and Central Europe. Our efforts to drive our Off the Wall culture deeper into Europe are clearly proving successful. We staged the Vans Downtown Showdown skate contest in Amsterdam with 9,000 people attending. On the heels of the successful Vans Warped Tour in U.S., the tour will return to U.K. for the first time in 13 years in November for a sold-out show at the iconic Alexandra Palace in North London. And we are building additional visibility through an aggressive outdoor campaign targeted at 30 cities in Europe and reaching 55 million consumers.", "During the quarter, we opened stores in Copenhagen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Stockholm and Amsterdam that showcase our new Vans retail concept. And so far, performance has been strong. The new LXVI product has launched in Europe as well in 188 doors and 14 countries. And as we mentioned last quarter, we simultaneously launched 7 new e-comm sites in Europe. Initial demand on these new sites has been strong across the board with the strongest demand in the U.K. region and in our classic category. So we are very bullish about the opportunities for this new channel to drive future growth for Vans.", "Vans Asian business also posted strong results in the third quarter, growing more than 40% in constant dollars. Hereto, we are seeing strength in the classic category and investing more behind programs to the Vans apparel to meet local needs. Additionally, we remain focused on deepening our connections with consumers in the region by leveraging consumer insights and learnings. We're driving skate culture awareness in the region to sponsorships such as our Go Skateboarding Day and Dragon SK8 Series.", "We also recently launched a new digital activation program called unlock your dreams in China with a strong collaborative and crowd sourcing component. Finally, Vans continued to show tremendous growth in a number of key distributor markets in Asia, most notably Australia, which further validates the regional growth opportunity we have beyond China.", "We remain confident in our global strategy and are excited about the strength we're carrying through '13, and now let's take a look at Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Global constant dollar revenues for Timberland declined slightly in the third quarter. In the Americas where the industry continues to grapple with excess inventories related to last year's unusually warm weather, the Timberland business declined moderately. It's important to note that we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint with inventories running down on a year-over-year comp basis. The absence of Timberland apparel in the Americas, a business that was formally licensed, negatively impacted revenues in the quarter. In addition, we continue to take actions to right size our distribution. While this also negatively impacted revenue, it also helped to drive improve profitability. These actions are all part of the model we deploy against new acquisitions geared toward building stronger top and bottom line performance in the future.", "This year on a global basis, Timberland should achieve a slight increase in revenues on a constant dollar basis. As we move through the year, we've continued to realize significant integration synergies driven by supply chain leverage, inventory discipline and organizational initiatives designed to bring Timberland's cost structure into better alignment with that of the overall Outdoor & Action Sports portfolio. And while we are still in the middle of our integration journey, we're quite pleased with the Timberland team's focus and commitment to driving this year's results, while we all continue to focus on initiatives to drive future success.", "Our Hookset Handcrafted collection, consisting of only 4 material components, is the most simple, eco-friendly footwear ever designed by Timberland and has been very well received. During the quarter, we also launched the exceptionally rugged Helcor boot collection with an integrated campaign that included street team product demos, webisodes and a launch party.", "On the DtoC side, we opened the first new full price retail store since the acquisition in Chicago during the month of August, certainly a strong market that appreciates great cold-weather footwear, and preliminary results are looking very good. So with 1 year under our belts, we're more excited than ever that there's a great future ahead for this powerful global brand.", "Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to take you through what's going on internationally with Timberland.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In increasingly more challenging environment, constant dollar revenues for Timberland in Europe were flat against last year. The bright spot in Europe are our men's footwear collections including hereto, the Hookset Handcrafted collection and our City Cap Toe. Both are showing good performance, as is our new fall outerwear collection. We're also seeing good response to some of our in-store retail initiatives, which has resulted in improved comp store performance toward the end of the quarter.", "Asia continues to experience strong growth with positive results across all product categories, very good retail comp performance and particular strength in the key Japanese market. We opened 10 retail doors during the quarter and are making great strides connecting with consumers in the region.", "And with that, let's switch gears to the Wrangler brand. Scott?", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. In our Americas region, our U.S. Jeanswear business was up 3% in the third quarter. In terms of Wrangler on a global basis, third quarter revenues declined 5% or 3% in constant currency. Wrangler revenues in the Americas region were down very slightly in constant dollars. Yet, we are seeing strength in our Western Specialty and Latin American businesses.", "Our ongoing commitment to product innovation continued to be central to driving growth with the Wrangler brand especially in our Western business, which has performed very well throughout the year. Our Wrangler 20X competition Jean is selling very well in the specialty store channel, as is our performance Cowboy Cut, fire-resistant Western and RIGGS collections. We're also pleased by the continued strength in our e-commerce business.", "In the mass channel, we are seeing success in our comfort Five Star Premium jean and in our expanded tops offering. We expect modest growth in our mass business in the fourth quarter, as we drive our comfort story and execute powerful in-store presentations. In Latin America, we're encouraged by solid growth in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, where we see our business accelerating nicely and expect to continue to gain traction.", "Turning to Wrangler's international business. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "As we have seen in the last several quarters, Wrangler's business in Europe continues to be challenged by demand difficult conditions there. Revenues for the third quarter were down high single digits on a constant dollar basis, but our efforts to improve profitability are paying off with strong improvements in gross margin. But we are seeing positive performance in some regions, for example, in Russia and Turkey. We also opened our first owned and operated store in Leipzig, Germany. This is our biggest Wrangler market so it provides great opportunity to stay connected with our consumers and tell the brand story in an even more authentic way.", "On a relative basis, we feel our performance is consistent with our peers and the greater market. We remain confident in our ability to carefully manage the business and inventory levels in accordance with market conditions. Our Wrangler business in Asia is quite small. And in India, an emerging key market in the region, we continue to experience positive momentum.", "Finally, let's take a look at Lee.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. Lee's business on a global basis achieved a slight increase in revenues on a constant dollar basis. Lee's Americas business saw a 3% constant dollar growth in the third quarter with solid growth in Latin America and Mexico and continued success on our new product innovations. In the U.S., the brand continues to navigate near-term difficulties created by ongoing challenging dynamics in the mid-tier channel.", "On the product front, Slender Secret, which combines great fit, great finishes and fashion details for the female consumer, has been our best-selling new product this fall. For Riders by Lee, our fit innovations, including Slender Stretch, continue to garner great reception. And we are encouraged by the continued solid results from lee.com, which grew 19% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we're excited about the Lee brand and its continued expansion with the Lee Platinum label collection in the department store channel. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Similar to Wrangler, Lee's European business has also been negatively impacted by challenging conditions with constant dollar revenues for the third quarter down at the high single-digit rate. However, hereto, we have our bright spots, mostly notably in Russia and Scandinavia, which are showing very strong revenue growth.", "Lee's women initiatives in Europe led by the Stretch Deluxe concept are outperforming expectations with our woman's jeans business anticipated to be up 15% this year. We're also excited about the launch of a new website for Lee in Europe. With an energized new look and feel, the new site should also help to stimulate sales in the region.", "In Asia, Lee's momentum continued with high single-digit growth. Throughout the region, we are focused on driving consumer connections to integrated 360-degree consumer center campaigns, which are contributing to the success of new product initiatives such as our Urban Riders collection.", "Now I turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, thanks, everyone, for a great overview, and I'll wrap up today's call with commentary around our third quarter financial performance and our updated guidance.", "Starting at the top with revenues. Our top line growth continues right in line with our expectations. Total revenues were up 14% or 17% in constant dollars. Organic revenue growth in the quarter mirrored that of the second, up 6% in constant dollars. Given our expectations for strong fourth quarter revenue comparisons, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 8% organic constant dollar revenue growth guidance for the year. And just as a reminder, each of these revenue comparisons is negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos.", "Now a few words about our international and direct-to-consumer businesses, both of which are important drivers of top and bottom line growth. You recall that in conjunction with our China investor meeting last month, we increased our 5-year goal for international revenues as a percent of total revenues from 40% to 45%. Current challenges in Europe and slight economic slowdown in China notwithstanding, we feel very good about our brands' prospects for continued international growth over the coming years given their generally low market penetration and demonstrated desirability with consumers.", "In the most recent quarter, total international growth in constant dollars was 28% with organic growth of 7%. Now there's no doubt that international organic growth is moderated from what we saw in prior quarters, primarily due to economic conditions in Europe. But again, we anticipated this slower growth and reflected it in our original guidance provided in February.", "The good news is that unlike many of our competitors, we're continuing to grow our business in Europe. In particular, our Vans brand has been exceptionally strong, growing by more than 40% in constant dollars in the quarter. That's the power of VF's diversified portfolio. And looking forward, we do expect significantly stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter in Europe driven by another quarter of exceptional growth at Vans and new store openings across a number of brands. And as Eric noted, we're still looking forward to delivering double-digit constant dollar organic revenue growth in Europe for the full year.", "Now in terms of Asia, the third quarter marked another period of exceptional growth in the region with organic constant dollar revenue growth of 25% in total and 23% in China. Last month, we set new 5-year growth targets for the Asia-Pacific region, 19% growth annually for Asia in total and 21% annual growth in China. For more specifics about our growth plans in Asia, I'd encourage you to view the presentations and videos available at vfinchina.com.  And for the full year, we remain very comfortable with our guidance for organic revenue growth in Asia Pacific of about 20%.", "Now I should also point out that we're seeing good growth in our other international markets outside of Europe and Asia, particularly in Canada and Mexico.  On a combined basis, organic growth in these other international markets was 7% in constant dollars. Growth in our direct-to-consumer business was another bright spot in the quarter with organic revenues rising by 9%. We experienced strong DTC growth at both The North Face and Vans of 10% and 18%, respectively, and we were also very pleased with the DTC performance of our Nautica, 7 For All Mankind and Kipling brands during the quarter.", "Year-to-date, we've opened 100 stores across our brands and remain on track to open a record 130 stores this year. Not only do these stores provide us with the source of very profitable growth, they also are helping to offset somewhat weaker conditions at wholesale, particularly in Europe. As you know, the fourth quarter is seasonally the most important quarter for our DTC business, and we're looking forward to double-digit DTC revenue growth for the quarter, given combination of new store growth, solid increases in comp store sales, the impact of higher marketing investments to drive store traffic and continued rapid growth in our e-comm business. For our DTC business in total, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year revenue guidance for organic growth of about 15%.", "Now a quick comment on the 3 businesses we haven't yet touched on: Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. In starting with Imagewear, I\u2019d anticipated, the revenue growth comparisons have continued to moderate from prior periods. You'll recall the string of strong double-digit comps in Imagewear revenues during 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, as they gained distribution and market share especially on the image or uniform side of the business during a slowly recovering economy. Now comping those exceptional growth periods of last year has proven challenging.", "On the other hand, Licensed Sports revenues rose at a healthy mid single-digit rate in the quarter, and the good news is that we remain confident in achieving our guidance for mid single-digit revenues growth for the full year. In terms of operating margin, the impact of higher product cost is now largely behind us. Fourth quarter operating margin for this coalition should reflect significant gains over the prior year period. Full year operating margin is expected to be about flat with the 14% achieved in 2011.", "Now on the surface, the Sportswear numbers indicate very modest growth in the quarter, but as we indicated in the second quarter, Sportswear is seeing a shift in the timing of special programs, which should lead to mid-teen revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Also contributing to the revenue comparisons in the last couple of quarters is a decrease in Nautica distressed sales. That hurts the top line but obviously, is good for the brand and for profitability. Nautica continues to grow its men's business with its biggest department store customer where it is gaining share and achieving higher AURs.", "Sportswear is on track to deliver high single-digit revenue growth for the full year and a significant improvement in operating margin. In terms of our Contemporary Brands business, keep in mind the reported results now reflect the sale of the John Varvatos business. If we take the Varvatos numbers out of both 2011 and 2012, revenues were up 2% in constant dollars in the quarter driven by high teen growth in our Splendid and Ella Moss businesses.", "And at 7 For All Mankind, revenue comps were affected by lower distressed product sales. Again, while this hurt sales comparison, it's a big contributor to the improved profitability of the coalition. Hereto, we expect stronger top line growth in a big improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter, with 7 For All Mankind anticipating the continuation of improved sell-throughs at retail.", "For the year, due to the Varvatos sale, total coalition revenue should decline by a mid single-digit rate. Excluding the Varvatos business from both 2011 and 2012, the coalition is on track to achieve high single-digit revenue growth.", "Now let's move on to gross margin. Our gross margin story is developing just as we had planned, if not, even a little better than anticipated at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, gross margin expanded by 140 basis points to 46.7%, which was an all-time high for us for the quarter. We pointed out the main drivers of the increase in our release, improved gross margins across nearly all of our businesses, a continuation of our business mix moving toward higher-margin businesses and lower product costs, particularly in our cotton-based businesses. We continue to expect the strongest gross margin comparison of the year in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be an all-time high for any quarter in VF's history.", "Product costs for our cotton-based businesses peaked in the fourth quarter of last year, also benefiting the comparisons is continued growth in our high-margin DTC business. Strong growth in our DTC business drives favorability at the gross and operating margin line. For the year, we now expect gross margin to expand by about 80 basis points.", "Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues were flat to 29.6% in the third quarter, but there's more to that story. As we pointed out in the past, Timberland's SG&A rate is higher than the rest of VF. So maintaining the overall SG&A ratio despite the inclusion of Timberland for our full quarter and 2012 points to our very disciplined cost controls across all our businesses.", "Our operating margin reached a record level on both an adjusted and reported basis in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin of 17.5% was 90 basis points above last year's third quarter. And while Timberland achieved the mid-teen operating margin in the quarter, exclusive of acquisition-related expenses, it negatively impacted VF's overall adjusted margin by 40 basis points.", "And that brings us to the bottom line and record earnings per share on both reported and adjusted basis. Included in this quarter's adjusted earnings per share of $3.52 was $0.54 per share of earnings from Timberland. That compares to $0.25 EPS contribution in last year's third quarter, which included just 3 weeks of Timberland earnings in a short but very profitable period for the brand.  Also impacting the current quarter's earnings is a combined $0.23 per share from foreign currency and higher pension expense.", "Now turning to our balance sheet. We are particularly proud of our tightly controlled inventories, which were actually down slightly year-over-year. Given our strong earnings growth and working capital management, we're looking forward to generating a record $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations this year.", "Now let's close with a recap of our revised earnings guidance. We've raised our annual EPS guidance by $0.10 per share from $9.50 to $9.60. That means our 2012 adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase by 17% over 2011. The euro rate assumption for the fourth quarter is 1.25 to the dollar. Our guidance also contemplates increased marketing investments over previously expected levels for the fourth quarter in both The North Face and Vans brands globally. These investments have historically proven to be drivers of both top and bottom line growth.", "Given some continued weakening in overall economic conditions, we're convinced that these are the right investments to make today to ensure that our brands remain front and center with consumers. Another factor relevant to our earnings guidance, we remain comfortable with the $1.10 in accretion from Timberland right in line with what we said back in February. In terms of revenues, our full year revenue guidance remains at $10.9 billion, which will mark another milestone for VF. And as we've noted, that's despite about a 1% negative impact on revenues from the John Varvatos sale.", "And finally, a few comments on the fourth quarter. We're looking forward to wrapping up 2012 on a really strong note. Based on our full year guidance, fourth quarter revenues should increase by 5% or 7% in constant dollars. And if you take the Varvatos sale under consideration, that number would be 8%. This, of course, will be the first quarter where we fully anniversary-ed the Timberland acquisition. I've commented on the fact that we're expecting very strong gross margin comparisons leading to operating margin expansion and in turn, another quarter of record earnings per share.", "Taking into consideration the revised adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.60, the fourth quarter points to earnings per share of $3.03, an increase of just over 30% over the $2.32 in adjusted earnings per share reported in last year's fourth quarter. The VF story is stronger than ever: revenues strong and growing, outstanding profitability, keeping our balance sheet strong and flexible. Our dividend increase of over 20% says a lot about our confidence. We look forward to a strong finish to the year and talking to you about our plans for another great year in 2013 during our next call in February. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. Let's open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Joseph Parkhill at Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about the reacceleration on European revenue in 4Q. Is that mostly due to a shift in wholesale orders? And have you seen that uptick already? And then also is that mostly driven by The North Face?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks for the question. Karl Heinz here. Just a few reminders, we had strong quarters in the past in Europe, and this is a reacceleration. It is correct. As you know, The North Face is our largest brand in Europe. So it is driven by The North Face. We also had some lower sales on jeans as we reported in the script. So I guess the combination of these 2, jeans and The North Face, has contributed to the 3%.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then the question was more around the reacceleration into 4Q.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, we do expect fourth quarter to grow again -- we said it in the script -- by low double digits, and we also do expect The North Face to grow in the fourth quarter. Vans, as you know, as you have heard in the script, is doing extremely well consistently over the year, and we expect strong numbers on the Vans fourth quarter as well. We also have a lot of new retail stores, which we didn't have last year on Vans but also on The North Face and our e-comm presence, which will give us stronger business in Q4.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then also just how are you looking in general about the open to buy in 4Q, particularly around The North Face and Timberland? Is there an ability to chase some sales if the winter proves to be colder and snowier than last year?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, we always said that the winter has actually more impact than weather, especially on The North Face and Timberland versus the economy. So the initial -- we don't know. We can't predict the winter, but we saw a colder winter -- a colder weather in October, and we saw that immediately on our comp sales on our stores. So if the winter is just normal, that will normalize. Remember, we had a very warm winter last year, and also, we have assumed very low reorder numbers in our forecast for the year. So if the winter's strong, then our numbers will be better.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kate McShane at Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In the past, when we've seen you increase your marketing spend, you've seen a clear opportunity in the market to take share. Is this how you're viewing your spend on The North Face and Vans? Or is it more an effort to support the brands globally? And can you quantify how much of this impact will have on SG&A in Q4?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Kate, it's Eric. I'll deal with the first part of that. Yes, when we pulled the trigger on focused brand investments, as we've just done, we've done it because we've seen very clear opportunities to capture some growth in share and to build momentum for next year, too, because, as you know, if we can drive better sell-through in the fourth quarter, it'll set us up for heavier ordering in 2013 in the fall season. So we look at -- and maybe -- and it gets back to the whole diversified portfolio story at VF. We look at where we have brands in a specific country that has a unique growth opportunity that we think we can accelerate with focused investment. We do that, and we hope that, that'll drive sell-through this year and set us up for bigger reorders last year. In terms of what it means to our SG&A in the fourth quarter, I don't -- did Bob don't know that. Bob looks like -- he's shaking his head like he may have an answer to that one, Kate.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I have one answer for that, Kate. In the fourth quarter despite the increased investment, we still expect our SG&A ratio to decline in the fourth quarter now. Part of that, of course, is as we -- as the expense ratios in Timberland improve, we'll see a significant opportunity there. So actually overall in the quarter, we will see improved ratios in SG&A versus last year.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask a second question, unrelated about China. Is there any way you can walk us through how much of the growth was from new distribution? I believe one of the brands you said you were able to double distribution and how much was from comp growth?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, sure. Karl Heinz here. I'll handle this question. With double distribution, that actually was not related to China but to our distributor markets, right, because our Asia presence, when we talk about Asia, we do talk about China but also our distributors, I think, we said Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia. So we doubled that business. On the China, as we said a few weeks ago during our conference, we still have -- we operate with 5 brands there, 5 let margin brands, and our total penetration is 2,200 doors, all 5. So we still have opportunities in spite of a little bit more tougher conditions in China to expand our distribution. Having said that, we don't give comps number by brands, but so far, what we have seen, our comp numbers are in line with what we expect.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jim Duffy at Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. On The North Face, you mentioned some movement in the order book from 3Q to 4Q. Is that something you could quantify for us?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Jim, this is Steve Rendle. Difficult to quantify it, but we've talked before about how we -- with the warm winter last year, how our dealers really started to move orders closer to demand. Also, I'd remind you that we were up 15% in the first half of the year, and some of that had to do with placing fall goods early, come through Q3 nicely and set up very, very well for Q4.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Karl Heinz, for The North Face in Europe, you mentioned retailers committing later there as well. Are retailers still in the mode of de-stocking? And then I was hoping you could offer some variances that you're seeing across the different countries in Europe with respect to The North Face brand.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, I think the retailers in Europe, they are handling and are managing at the moment an inventory program, which is an overhang from last winter, right? Yes, we have seen a little bit more aggressive terms in the market. There's still inventories around. Again, a normal winter. We don't see an exceptional winter but just a normal winter compared to the bad situation we had last year. We, certainly over a few quarters or maybe 1 or 2 quarters, will normalize the situation.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last question on the Jeanswear business, the Jeanswear business had some difficult compares against 2Q and 3Q in '11. Those compares seemed to ease beginning in the 4Q. Is there reason or should that be reason to think that the year-to-year growth can improve in the Jeanswear business? Or is that not how you're seeing it?", "Scott H. Baxter", "Yes. Jim, why don't I take the North American piece okay? This is Scott, and then I'll hand it over to Karl Heinz. Yes. We feel confident on the plan for the year. And I've stated before that we felt as though we have and hit our plan for a low to mid-single-digit growth and still feel that way going into the fourth quarter. Feel real good about the Wrangler health in the rest of the year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "On the international side, let's divide between Europe and Asia. Asia is good as you have heard. We have been consistently growing. Europe is more challenging, and if you look at all the competitor situation, there are very few brands -- actually, as far as we know, no brands, which had consistent growth in Europe. Our strategy is clearly focused on improving profitability. You heard us saying our margins are increasing from quarter-to-quarter, and we are now on par on our jeans margin with some of our outdoor brands.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mitch Kummetz at Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, a couple of questions. First for Steve Rendle, Steve, could you give us spring backlog on North Face, Vans and Timberland?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Mitch, would that be spring 2013?", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Correct.", "Steven E. Rendle", "It's a little too early to call similar to what we've seen in the fall order book. We have dealers moving specifically with The North Face, demand closer to need, and we're still in the kind of the final wrap-up of our spring. And in the case of Timberland and Vans, I know you're familiar with the footwear model. Demand there absolutely moves closer or orders move very close to demand, and we're just really 2 months into collecting those orders. So it's early to call. I will tell you early reads, we're feeling very good that we'll deliver at historic levels.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, on cotton, can you quantify the impact on Q3 in terms of the basis point impact and then kind of what your thoughts are in terms of quantifying that impact on Q4? You mentioned that, that's your easiest comparison year-over-year on cotton and maybe even some preliminary comments on how that might benefit you through the -- at least the first half of next year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Mitch. So it might be useful just to go through some of the breakdowns of the gross margin comparisons. So in the third quarter, the improvement of 140 basis points mix, just the improved mix moving -- our business moving to higher margin businesses was 60 basis points of that 140. Now Timberland in the third quarter still hurt us a little bit, so that cost us about 20 basis points in the comparison year-over-year. Once again, we had that -- keep in mind, we had that for a full quarter. And the rest, which is about 100 basis points is what's left, was pretty well split between cotton-based cost reductions and just overall improvements in the rest of our business. I made a point of couple of times in my comments that we're seeing gross margin expansion across the board in nearly every one of our businesses. And that, of course, is driving improvement as well. So in that remaining 100 basis points, about half of that was related to the cotton businesses, and the other half were other efficiencies like lower distressed sales, that type thing, will improve mix. In the fourth quarter, the implication with the 80 basis points of improvement is about 260 basis points of gross margin improvement, so a really strong quarter. Now to your point, up against the toughest comparisons last year when cotton costs were highest in the fourth quarter, that's when they really peaked and that's when it impacted our margins the most. But in the fourth quarter, once again, we expect to see a mix impact of about 80 basis points, so a really strong mix improvement. Timberland will help us in the fourth quarter as well, will add about 20 basis points, and the remainder, once again, are from all of our other businesses including product costs and other efficiencies that we're seeing across the board. And yes, I'd say well, I don't have a specific number, Mitch, about the same amount. About half of that is driven by our cotton-based businesses in terms of reductions, and the other half, just by other efficiencies. As we go into the early part of 2013, as you know, we'll talk a lot more about that in February, and we won't say a lot about that right now. We just -- we don't expect a lot fluctuation at this point in terms of our cotton-based businesses and their costs. Keep in mind that while cotton is down, not all of that has yet been passed through in denim cost. So we haven't yet seen all of that improvement. So again, we don't expect a big change going into the first part of next year, at this point in time anyway, relative to where we are especially on denim cost.", "Operator", "We'll go next Eric Tracy at Janney Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I guess if I could follow up on the increase in the marketing spend, is it possible to get sort of order of magnitude by geographic region? And then maybe, Eric, just backing up a little bit, what it speaks to in terms of what you're seeing from last quarter in terms of deterioration in Europe? You mentioned slow down here domestically. So what are the signs that are -- you're sort of seeing and again, the order of magnitude of where you're stepping up on those investments?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, I'm going to deal with the first part of this and then hand it over to Bob, who has a very large spreadsheet in front of him that's going to help him give you some specific numbers. Comment on your question about the deterioration in Europe, just to remind you and everyone, our business is around 80% wholesale and about 20% retail. So what we saw in the slowdown in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter was largely the result in The North Face of a slowdown in retailers buying fall outerwear because they were carrying over some fall outerwear from last winter, had nothing to do with consumer demand for the brand whatsoever. It's all about how we push product ultimately to consumers. We know with the product placement we have, both what we've shipped this year and what we -- what's at retail from last year, that we're in a strong position right now to grab some market share. And that's what leads us to pull the trigger on the additional investments. Bob, can you comment?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, just what I can tell you is that in our core businesses, in other words, excluding Timberland, the increase in our marketing investment will be $18 million over the prior year's fourth quarter. So that's about a 13% increase overall. Now relative to the breakout, Eric, between U.S. and the international side, I guess I'd ask Steve or Karl Heinz to speak to that.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Fairly even? Is that the case? I would say it's pretty even between the U.S. businesses and internationally.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. And remember that we had a split between Europe and China as well as we mentioned. China, we do Vans and The North Face; and in Europe we do the North Face and Vans in 2 -- 3 countries, Germany, U.K. and Benelux.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then to switch gears a little bit to Timberland, maybe just walk us through as we head in to 4Q and certainly, next year and lapping the integrating of the business, just the cadence of the top line and maybe even more -- because I know you're vetting distribution. You're sort of rolling out the apparel side, how we should think about top line growth, what profitability should look like? And then on the apparel side, I know it's more fully developed internationally. How do you think about syncing up what you got existing versus, again, sort of creating that new apparel offering?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Great. Eric, this is Steve Rendle. I'll take it, and perhaps, Karl Heinz can add some additional color. So on Timberland and the cadence of our Q4 top line, as I mentioned, we have been putting quite a bit of effort into really rightsizing our business model there, focusing on our go-to-market strategy, product segmentation and also looking at -- within our own retail store mix opportunities to remove underperforming stores. That, in addition to the absence of Timberland apparel, which was a licensee arrangement previously, has -- had a negative impact on our top line, but I would emphasize that it's had a significant improvement on our profitability. And as we right size our business model, we're really setting ourselves up for the future. And I would tell you, as we look back historically with The North Face and Vans integration, there's a lot of experience in understanding of the value of those actions, and our team at Timberland are focused on getting those done quickly and very effectively. On the apparel, our international business is where the bulk of our apparel is sold, and we'll be relaunching apparel here in the United States. And we see opportunity to begin to grab momentum next year with some key partners. But the good -- the products are designed and developed in Europe, and we see taking that European collection and with the help of our -- the brand work we've been doing over the last 12 months being able to inform what a global product line would look like with all of the relevant regional nuances required to drive good sell-through.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "If I can just finally add, apparel is very important for us in Europe and even more so in Asia. It wasn't before a regional effort, and we, certainly, will benefit from now going forward because it's becoming a company global effort. So there are much more strength behind the development of this program. So in short, it will be good for us going forward.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then lastly, Eric and Bob, maybe just speak to capital allocation. Certainly, aware of the company's track record, increased dividend here but just a ton of free cash. Maybe just speak to sort of the M&A environment, any -- now sort of fully integrated Timberland, how we should be thinking about augmenting the organic growth?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Eric, we -- our priorities relative to how we allocate capital remain the same. You're right especially by year end, we'll be out of commercial paper with a very strong fourth quarter cash generation number. So once again, we'll be in a great spot with a balance sheet that has a lot of flexibility in it to do further acquisitions. So the M&A side remains our #1 priority for sure. Relative to the buyback, we bought back a couple million shares in the early part of this year, and once again, our approach there is to offset the impact of option exercises, and that hasn't -- that really hasn't changed. So our priorities remain the same and again, our balance sheet remains quite strong and gives us a lot of flexibility to do so.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Robbie Ohmes at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I -- my one question and then I\u2019ll just ask the follow-up before you guys answer, but can you guys talk about your global AUR trends? You mentioned the strength of your product margins across all your brands, and I know some of that obviously is cost reductions. But can you walk through the aspect of that, that might be related to price increases and where you are in AURs in your key businesses, obviously, North Face and Jeanswear and then maybe even in Vans, what that looks like? And my follow-up question, which is going to be, Eric, can you talk a little bit more about may be the -- just follow up on the capital allocation question. Divestitures versus acquisitions, where your head is at maybe reminding us John Varvatos small, but you've gotten rid of it. Could there be other opportunities to sort of pare down the portfolio?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, sure Robbie, I'll start with the second piece. As you know, we're constantly looking at the shape of our portfolio because we believe that the diversity of our portfolio is our strength. So we have to spend a lot of time looking at what's in and what's not in our portfolio, and we do that on an ongoing basis. So far this year, that's resulted in the divestiture of the John Varvatos business, has not resulted in any acquisitions this year. We're pretty focused on the integration of Timberland this year for all the appropriate reasons. However, as we were just talking about -- with Eric the -- we were having a great capital year. As Bob said, acquisitions are our priority, and we're beginning to look into 2013 about what we might do. I can't offer any specifics about any particular action that we might take, but you should know that it's something that we're always working on and always have a few irons in the fire on both sides actually. On the AUR thing, I'm going to make an overall comment and then pass it on to somebody else in the room. I would say Steve Rendle is raising his hand. In general, there's a timing difference between our businesses. In 2011, we took the big price increases in our denim-based businesses, and that's when cotton was a big issue. We had big price increases that -- cost increases that we passed some of them along to consumers, but our prices in the denim business have or in our jeans business have been more stable this year than the big changes we took last year. In our synthetic businesses, like The North Face, we're seeing those price increases passed along this year. So there is a difference in timing. And with that overview, Steve, did you want to comment?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. Robby, on the North Face and Vans in particular, as we look at year-over-year, we have a significant percent of our total offering that's new, and then we're able to bring new innovation, new styles, new colors. We're able to really look for those value price points and have AURs that help us look for incremental margin improvement. I would tell you also as we brought Timberland into the platform, we've seen good supply chain leverage that's benefited not only Timberland but also our Vans and North Face footwear businesses. And as we grow our DtoC component, we're seeing a benefit in mix as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad at ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of switching back to Timberland again, if you kind of go back to when you made the deal and walked everybody through kind of your long-term expectations, seemed like you guys were looking at, I believe, if memory serves, a 10% kind of annualized top line growth rate. Can you talk about where the business has been and what's different versus your expectations? And is this just kind of how you had planned it from the beginning, that you needed kind of a little bit of a retrenchment, rationalizing some of the distribution, setting up the apparel piece properly before the reacceleration occurs? Are there any discrepancies from what your original expectations were there? And if so, what are the underlying causes? And then I have one follow-up.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Omar, this is Steve. I'll take a shot at this one. So as we're 1 year into this acquisition, what we have found and what we have able to work on is very consistent with what we knew going in. We knew we needed to do some work on the go-to-market model specifically around distribution and on product segmentation, putting the right products in the right channels and working with customers on just basically how to market or merchandise those styles. We also knew that we had a retail distribution that needed some particular effort and investments behind our e-commerce, as we were able to drive momentum there. We're seeing good improvement. So what we found is very similar to what we expected. As I'd mentioned, it feels very, very similar to what we found with The North Face in 2000 and Vans in 2004. I would say the difference being is the magnitude of the acquisition is a little bit different, but I would tell you our knowledge and the quality of our leadership team that's in place both here in the U.S. and internationally, the capabilities and their ability to leverage the VF knowledge has helped us get after this at a much quicker rate.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Omar, I'll just add quickly that it's going just about the way we thought. I would say Europe's a little bit tougher than we thought originally. But that probably isn't too much of a surprise. But overall, as Steve said, we're -- it's modeling -- it's working out kind of the way we modeled it, which is let's build the foundation first and then move forward, and that's what we did with The North Face, and that's what we did with Vans. And I'll remind everyone that we expect this year for it contribute $1.10, and that's right where we are. So economics are working out right on plan for us.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up, on the -- can you give us an update on what's happening in China in terms of the inventory situation for you guys and then the kind of competitive landscape? I know there's been a buildup in some of the department stores and malls in terms of the numbers of brands that are over there, the amount of stores that everybody has or the inventory situation and how that's impacting your business?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, Omar. You will recall -- Karl Heinz. You will recall in Asia, it's not the same on all our businesses. For instance, we don't see that in our outdoor business. Our performance is very strong, but we are affected, and we see it in our jeans business. There's certainly a hangover of inventory as far as us is concerned, we had touched on jeans. We do see that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christian Buss at Credit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes. I was wondering if you could talk about your ability to support reorder activity given your tight inventory management heading into the fourth quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I'll start on that and maybe the rest of the folks here want to pick up. Relative to our shipping performance despite the fact that our inventories are down a little bit, a lot of that actually came from Timberland where we expected to reduce our inventories. Our shipping performance has been as strong as ever. So despite the fact that our inventories are down and they'll stay down, our shipping performance has been really strong. So again, a lot of the reduction is in Timberland, which is exactly what we expected, and we don't see any challenges whatsoever in terms of our ability to support our business going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to David Glick at Buckingham Research Group.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Just a follow-up on the Jeanswear business, you continue to cite the mid-tier as a challenge for Lee, and I think we all know the source of that challenge. And when you look at the presence of the brand across the mid-tier channel and in some cases, the department stores, the brand has a very strong presence. And when you look at the Lee jeans presentation in JCPenney, it's not in the young men's area. For example, it's off in the men's area. And I'm just wondering how long these challenges are going to continue? And at what point do you go more on the offensive with that key retailer? Or is there -- you mentioned the department store opportunity. I think it was premium, Scott, you mentioned. Is there an opportunity to maybe offset what's happening at Penney's with some other retailers?", "Scott H. Baxter", "Yes, no problem, David. I did mention in my opening comments that we are pretty excited about our -- it's called Platinum label, and we are -- and have had some success already in the department store channel, but we're expanding our offering. And we feel real confident about it and have a very large test going on right now. So we do understand that the Lee brand, it's very strong, very healthy right now, but we need to go ahead and work through additional channels and expansion with the Lee brand, and that's currently what we're doing with that. As far as the mid-tier channel, Lee had a very strong year. We are working through the situation that you discussed. We don't comment on specific customers, but we're working very closely with them to make sure the end result is positive for both parties. And that's probably the most that I can currently say about that. But for the year, we feel real good about the Lee brand, feel real good about the test that we're running and feel real good about the holiday season.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "How much do guys do shop at JCPenney? Or that's part you can't tell me about right now?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, we have actually -- our 2 biggest businesses with Penney's are Vans and Lee, and those are in discussions with Penney's about how to contribute to their new strategy in a very significant way. And more on that in the future, but there's -- nobody's committed to anything yet.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Michael Binetti at UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can I just -- Eric, can I go back to a comment that Karl Heinz made earlier when -- that when the weather got colder in October, you saw the comps accelerate at your own North Face store. I think he was talking about Europe. Does that translate to the U.S. business, what you guys have seen so far in October as well?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, the first -- I can tell you the first week in October was cold because I know when we saw a spike in the performance in our stores because everybody was texting about it that weekend. So yes, and that was very encouraging to us because if that says when needed, they liked our products because they came to the stores, our traffic was up, and our conversion was up, and they bought in abundance. So we're hoping that we get more weather like that in the next 90 days.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And I know last year, we talked about this. There's definitely some differences between categories like jackets versus boots, but does that comment translate over to Timberland doors as well by chance?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. Because I started this, we saw the same -- Michael, we saw the same reaction our comp stores on Timberland, predominately footwear Europe. Yes, so the answer is yes.", "Steven E. Rendle", "And the answer is definitely yes here in the United States as well.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I just look at the fourth quarter guidance, it seems like it calls for some pretty significant contribution from Timberland. I'm thinking on the cost savings side, it seems like a lot of the synergies you've been talking about there accelerated in the fourth quarter. So can you just walk us through some of the components of the Timberland contribution in fourth quarter and how that's a little bit different, a little bit magnified versus the rest of the year for our models, please?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Michael, you're talking about relative the 30% EPS growth in quarter?", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Or maybe even just the $1.10 in synergy?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Okay.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Michael, you're absolutely right on. And of course, it's a gross margin as well as an SG&A story. From a gross margin standpoint, we will see improved gross margin comparisons for the Timberland business in the fourth quarter. Last year at this point in time, we were battling the higher costs without really any pricing cover and prices. We have a little bit of pricing cover this year, and the improvements that Steve was talking about earlier in the supply chain, so just managing the business a lot more cleanly so that all of those factors impact the gross margins, and Timberland will contribute to improvement in our gross margin comparison in the fourth quarter. On the SG&A line, as I said earlier, again, a significant comparison improvement there as well. Last year at this point in time, we really were just beginning to address some of the cost-reduction opportunities that we were seeing in the SG&A area, and now those are being realized, not fully yet. And yes, we are. We're actually ahead of some of our original projections in terms of what we thought we could -- the cost reductions that we thought we could achieve on Timberland. So you\u2019ve got stronger gross margins and the SG&A cost really coming in line to produce a nice contribution for Timberland in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could just leave it with one last thing, I just want to make sure I'm clear on -- just from a modeling standpoint. You guys feel that there was actually a push of revenues in Europe from the third quarter into the fourth quarter based on the changes in the deliveries, right?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, we said before, Michael, we expect a low double-digit growth in Q4 in Europe again.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And you do believe that came out in third quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "It's in constant dollars.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "It's in constant dollar, Yes. It's constant dollars.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, just quick comment, we're confident in our year and we're confident in a really strong fourth quarter. When we look at the fourth quarter including Timberland and excluding John Varvatos, so on an apples-to-apples basis, we think we're going to grow 8% on a constant currency basis. That's what our call was for the year all along, to grow 8%. We're tracking -- we're right on track there. Our earnings per share are going to be up over 30%. We're a little bit ahead of plan there, and we're investing more than we thought so that we can propel ourselves into next year. And with that, I'll thank you for your time and attention, and we'll talk to you again in February. Thanks.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss VF's fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year results. Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements in the definition of the federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.", "Additionally, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and on our website at vfc.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be VF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; 2 of our Group Presidents, Scott Baxter and Steve Rendle; and Karen Murray, President of VF Sportswear; and Susan Kellogg, President of VF Contemporary Brands. Karl Heinz Salzburger made the flight and is here in North Carolina today, however, he is sick and unable to join us on today's call. So Steve, Scott and Karen will be filling in appropriately for his parts.", "Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. To set a little context for today's call, we thought it was important to spend a bit more time on our expectations for 2013 and specifically, the strategic initiatives we're concentrating on to drive continued growth across our portfolio. So as a heads-up, today's call will run a bit longer than normal, and as Lance said, we'll allow ample time for questions at the end. Let's get started.", "2012 was another year of records for VF: record revenues, record margins, record earnings and record cash flow from operations. It was a year that revealed many strengths of our company and many advantages to our strategy and our business model. In fact, VF has unique strengths in our industry, including a diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands, with innovative and relevant products capable of reaching the broadest array of consumers in every market; deep strategic insights, validated by comprehensive research that yields increasingly greater returns on our marketing investment and ability to attract -- to connect with consumers; an obsessive focus on continuously improving our operational capabilities to drive growth and strong consistent returns to our shareholders; and finally, a highly efficient supply chain that includes owned and sourced manufacturing, which gives us unparalleled structural advantages, including product innovation, speed to market, low cost and outstanding quality. Individually, any one of these strengths would be an enviable asset for any company to have. Yet together, in concert, they're at the center VF's DNA and what allows us to be so successful.", "Now let's take a look at how some of these strengths played out for the year just ended. Total revenues grew 15% to $10.9 billion or 17% on a constant dollar basis, including organic growth in every coalition, every geographic region and in both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. In constant dollars, our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition grew revenues by 31% or 13% on an organic basis. Internationally, constant dollar revenues for the year were up 29% or 11% if you exclude Timberland. And our direct-to-consumer business grew 25%, an increase that now takes our DTC business to 21% of total VF revenues.", "Full year gross margin rose by 75 basis points to a record 46.5%, with improvements in nearly every business. And very important to this story is the fact that it's about much more than product cost. Our improvements continue to be impacted most greatly by the shift in our portfolio mix towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses and geographies.", "Our profitability also got stronger this year. In fact, all 5 coalitions ended the year with double-digit operating margins for a combined 13.5%. Excluding Timberland, our operating margin would've reached 14.4%, once again reinforcing our confidence and our ability to reach our 15% goal by 2015.", "And finally, our adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $9.63, well above our long-term expectation for 12% annual EPS growth. And included in that result is $1.12 in earnings per share from Timberland.", "Turning to 2013, I'd like to underscore the confidence I have in VF's ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. All global companies operate in a constantly fluctuating environment, and we have validated time and again our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. 2013 is no different. We'll continue to leverage our portfolio and competitive advantages to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings while mitigating risks and most importantly, creating long-term value for our shareholders.", "Taking a brief look at a few of our 2013 highlights. First, we expect revenues to increase approximately 6%, which will take us to the $11.5 billion mark. But let me make one thing clear, VF is not a 6% growth company, it's a 10% growth company. In 2013, there were 2 external factors weighing on our growth, both of which are well known to you: First, a second unseasonably warm winter, which is affecting our largest brand, The North Face; and second, weak economic conditions in Europe, which accounts for 22% of VF's revenues. In addition, we have no acquisitions baked into our plan this year. Beyond 2013, our confidence in the power of VF's portfolio to deliver 10% revenue growth remains high.", "Below the revenue line, we're expecting substantial margin expansion over the results we just posted in 2012. Gross margins should expand by 100 basis points to 47.5%, and adjusted operating margin is expected to grow by nearly 100 basis points, which puts us very close to our 2015 goal 2 years ahead of schedule. And we expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 11% to $10.70. All of this is expected to yield another record year of cash flow from operations, which should approach $1.4 billion. Clearly, a great year ahead of us, with balanced growth, strong profitability and the leadership you've come to expect from VF.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob to discuss our fourth quarter financial performance and guidance in greater detail. Bob?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Thanks, Eric. I'm going to start with a reminder. This is the first quarter where we completely anniversary the Timberland acquisition, so all fourth quarter commentary reflects organic performance. Total revenue growth was 4% in the quarter or 5% in constant dollars. And as in the last 2 quarters, revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos. Excluding the impact of John Varvatos on our Contemporary Brands coalition, every VF coalition worldwide achieved higher revenues in the quarter. Also, we significantly expanded both gross and operating margins in the quarter. Our gross margin increased 220 basis points, reaching 47.4%, an all-time high for any quarter in VF's history. Every coalition achieved a higher gross margin. As you might expect, the biggest increase came in our Jeanswear business, where we continue to move closer to our historically stronger gross margin levels, following the volatility created by rising cotton costs over the past couple years.", "And of course, our gross margin increase continues to reflect the shift in our mix toward higher-margin businesses. And that's particularly true in the fourth quarter, given our growing retail store footprint and expanding e-commerce business within our higher-margin lifestyle brands. The positive dynamic of expanding gross margin driven by the faster pace of growth in our higher-margin businesses has been and will continue to be a key component of VF's earnings growth story in both 2013 and in years to come. The increase in adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, that is excluding the acquisition-related expenses for Timberland, was even stronger, up 280 basis points and reaching 15.1%.", "And a comment on our tax rate, which was right in line with both our expectations and the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our fourth quarter rate is a little lower than our annual rate due to a higher mix of international, with its lower effective rate.", "And that brings us to the bottom line and another quarter of record earnings per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share, again excluding Timberland acquisition-related expenses, increased 32% to $3.07. And as we've seen in prior quarters, the fourth quarter included a combined negative impact from foreign currency and higher pension expense of $0.09 per share. All in all, a great quarter for VF shareholders.", "Now a few comments in the fourth quarter financial performance of our coalitions. Our Outdoor & Action Sports business posted a 6% increase in revenues in the quarter. Vans and The North Face continue to exhibit very healthy growth. Timberland declined 4%, which impacted the overall revenue comparison for the coalition in the quarter.", "We are particularly pleased by the 11% constant dollar growth in The North Face, given the challenges of another warm winter, difficult conditions in Europe and retailers' carryover of inventory from 2011. Recall too that The North Face faced pretty tough comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, when constant dollar revenues increased 22%. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2012, The North Face posted healthy growth in all key regions and balanced growth in both its wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses.", "And Vans posted outstanding results. The 22% constant dollar revenue growth in the quarter bears repeating. The brand continues to be on fire in Europe, posting a nearly 60% increase in constant dollar revenues in the fourth quarter. Hereto, we see very balanced growth across geographies and channels. In fact, in the fourth quarter, Vans wholesale business grew over 23%, while its DtoC business increased 18%.", "Now for Timberland, the biggest impact in results in the quarter were unseasonably warm weather and difficult conditions in Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, which is Timberland's largest market there. Two bright spots in the quarter were Timberland's direct-to-consumer and Asia businesses, both of which achieved solid growth. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in building the foundation for strong future growth for Timberland in terms of leadership, operations and product development. And we are as convinced as ever that the brand is poised for accelerating growth in the years to come.", "The profitability of our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition continues to shine, with an 18% increase in operating income to an operating margin of 18.8%. As you know, Timberland's operating margin is below that of our core Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, which continued to deliver outstanding profitability at the 20% level in the quarter. Given our work with Timberland over the past year, we remain confident that the brand's profitability will approach that of our core Outdoor & Action Sports businesses.", "Jeanswear top line results strengthened a bit this quarter, growing by 4% in constant dollars. Our Americas business continues to deliver solid performance, with growth in our Mass, Western and Latin America businesses. On the flip side, Lee's top line continues to experience pressure, both in the U.S. and abroad, with challenging dynamics in mid-tier department stores, weak economic conditions in Europe and a buildup in retailers' inventories in China.", "The real story in Jeanswear this quarter is a significant improvement in profitability that I referenced earlier, with operating margin reaching 17.9%, moving closer to our historically stronger levels. Imagewear posted modest top line growth in the quarter, up 2%, but that's against a pretty tough comp for this coalition last year, when fourth quarter revenues grew by a very healthy 10%.", "Hereto, the bigger story is the bottom line. In the third quarter, we indicated that the Imagewear operating margin comparison should improve in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what we saw, operating margin improvement to 13.1%.", "In percentage terms, the strongest revenue gain in the quarter was posted by our Sportswear business, where revenues grew by 15%. Both Nautica and Kipling contributed to the quarter's very strong growth. The profitability improvements we started to see last year continued into 2012, with Nautica product performing really well at retail and its DtoC business also showing a lot of improvement. Our Sportswear coalition's momentum on both the top and bottom lines is clearly accelerating and is expected to continue in 2013 as well.", "The story in our Contemporary Brands business is also one of both top and bottom line growth. The decline in reported revenues was due entirely to the John Varvatos sale. Otherwise, the businesses, consisting of the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands, saw a 4% gain in revenues in constant dollars. The profit picture in Contemporary Brands also continues to get better, with a substantial improvement posted in 2012 and continued gains expected this year.", "And now just a few words on our balance sheet before moving on to our guidance for 2013. VF's balance sheet continues to be in incredible shape. We ended the year with nearly $600 million in cash, and we bought 2 million shares of our stock early in the year. We paid down all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, contributed $100 million to our pension plan and raised our dividend by a very healthy rate. Our strong working capital management was evidenced by a $100 million reduction in inventory year-over-year. And we didn't miss a beat in servicing our businesses' needs. On-time shipping performance was at our highest levels ever. Our strong earnings and working capital management fueled cash flow from operations of nearly $1.3 billion in 2012, another record for VF.", "So onto 2013. We entered 2013 with great confidence in our plans for growth. In terms of the top line, we're looking forward to another year of strong balanced growth across our coalitions. In 2013, we expect revenues to increase by about 6%. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition should lead the way, with about 10% growth driven by continued strength in both Vans and The North Face brands. Vans is expected to grow nearly 20%; and The North Face, at a high single-digit rate. We're targeting modest growth in Jeanswear, with the continuation of solid performance in our Americas business. Contemporary Brands, excluding John Varvatos, and Sportswear are looking forward to a year of high single-digit growth, while Imagewear is planning for mid-single-digit growth. You'll hear a lot more from our coalition leaders on their brand-specific growth initiatives in just a moment.", "International and direct-to-consumer should continue to be key growth drivers for VF in 2013. We're targeting 10% revenue growth in our International business this year. Asia will continue to be our strongest region, growing at a low-teen rate in 2013. And that's below the 17% 5-year target that we presented in September. But as we acknowledged then, and as most of you know, there has been a buildup in inventories in certain categories in China as a result of some moderation in economic growth there last year. That is placing some near-term pressure on our growth, particularly in our Jeans business. We think it will take a couple more quarters for those inventories to clear, at which time we expect to resume growth in Asia closer to our target levels. Our 5-year targets for 17% revenue growth in Asia and 21% in China remain intact. In Europe, our brands continue to expand and gain share, which should help drive a high single-digit increase in our European revenues this year. And on a combined basis, our non-U.S. Americas region is looking forward to a really strong year, with revenues expected to grow at a mid-teen rate.", "In 2012, international revenues accounted for 37% of VF's total revenues. And in 2013, we should move to 38% of total revenues as we continue to make progress against our 5-year target of 45%. DtoC will again be a significant growth driver for us in 2013.", "We're planning to open about 160 stores this year, up from 141 stores opened in 2012. These stores allow our brands to bring their stories to life and create growth in the face of regional economic and channel pressures while also providing very profitable returns. And speaking of profitable growth, our e-commerce business continues to expand rapidly and should again grow in excess of 30% in 2013. The combination of new stores, comp store growth and e-com increases should drive a mid-teen percentage increase in DtoC revenues this year, resulting in DtoC revenues growing to 23% of total revenues from 21% in 2012.", "Now a couple of comments on the expected cadence for revenue growth this year. The quarters that will deviate most from our overall rate for the year are the first and fourth quarters. 2013's first quarter is comping against the first quarter of 2012 that included early shipments of Jeanswear spring/summer product, which isn't likely to repeat this year. And the inventory issue in China that I mentioned earlier will also mute first quarter revenues. On the other hand, fourth quarter revenue and profit comparisons should be the strongest of the year, reflecting the seasonal benefits from our growing DtoC business.", "And now onto margins. In today's release, we indicated that we expect a 100-basis-point improvement in gross margin and a nearly 100-basis-point improvement in operating margin this year. And that's on top of the strong margin improvement we reported today for 2012. The components of this year's increase include the continued mix benefit that I spoke to earlier, lower product costs and a variety of supply chain initiatives designed to drive even greater efficiencies. At the same time, we're planning another big year of brand and technology investments. In fact, our marketing spend should expand even further from 5.3% of revenues in 2012 to 5.6% in 2013, with obviously a much higher rate of spend against our more consumer-facing brands.", "And our planned capital expenditures this year are $325 million, up from $252 million in 2012, including the higher number of new store openings, new distribution centers, as well as technology upgrades driving another year of significant investment to support our current and future growth.", "Okay, so wrapping up with our earnings per share guidance. Our target for adjusted earnings per share in 2013 is approximately $10.70. That represents 11% growth over the adjusted EPS of $9.63 in 2012 and is in line with our long-term EPS target we set in 2011.", "Now just to be clear, the adjusted numbers exclude Timberland-related expenses, which are currently anticipated to be about $15 million or $0.10 per share this year. On a GAAP basis, in other words, including the Timberland acquisition-related expenses and the gain on sale of John Varvatos in early 2012, earnings per share are expected to increase 9% to about $10.60 from $9.70 in 2012.", "And for those of you who may be wondering, pension expense should be neutral to our comparisons this year. Also, the assumed euro-to-dollar rate is 1.30. And to anticipate a question you might have, the impact of a $0.05 move in the euro against the dollar would be about $90 million in revenues and $0.15 in EPS.", "And one other outstanding item, really no news to report on Billabong, just a continuation of our discussions. And as you probably anticipated, we won't have any other commentary at this point related to Billabong.", "So in summary, we're really pleased to wrap up another great year for VF and our shareholders, and we have tremendous confidence in the 2013 guidance we provided to you today. The VF-wide focus on innovation as a key growth driver is clearly working as we outperform our competitors and gain share in nearly every category and market. Our focus on TSR, or total shareholder return, has really paid off, with VF generating a TSR CAGR of 30% over the last 3 years. And we're far from done. We're winning, and we intend to keep winning.", "I'm really eager for you to hear about what's next for our brands directly from our business leaders, so let's get to it. First up, Steve Rendle.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thanks, Bob. Outdoor & Action Sports is VF's largest and most diverse coalition. Our coalition's portfolio of brands is purpose-built to engage the passions of a wide variety of activity-driven consumers around the world.", "In 2012, global revenues for The North Face were up 9% or 11% on a constant dollar basis, including a 13% increase in the brand's DtoC business and double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.", "In 2013, we expect The North Face's global revenues to grow at high single-digit rate. Despite customer caution following 2 consecutive warmer-than-normal winters in the U.S. and challenging conditions in Europe, we are confident in our plans to deliver solid growth and reach another year of record revenues for the brand. The North Face brand is stronger than ever. We continue to win against our competition, and we intend to keep winning.", "Coping with current market dynamics has revealed the true strength of The North Face brand and its strategies, specifically, our activity-based model and our advanced product platform. A little more than 3 years ago, we introduced the activity-based model, reorganizing our business around 4 categories: action sports, performance, outdoor and youth. We've successfully broadened our product offering and extended our consumer and customer base. Today, The North Face is a brand for all seasons with a growing footprint in brand-relevant category extensions. And honestly, we're just getting started.", "Two years ago, we also upped the investment behind our advanced product platform and accelerated our efforts to create next-generation products to drive consumer demand in all categories. You can see the results of this investment in the success of Flash Dry, our moisture management material technology launched last fall that lets the consumer stay drier and warmer in a broad range of environmental conditions. It sold in and sold through very well in 2012 and continues to show solid performance.", "In 2013, you will see the introduction of Thermoball, an exclusive, new insulation material that will serve as the foundation for our insulated outerwear product story, an innovation that is very lightweight, as warm as 600 fill down, yet maintains a high level of thermal insulation when wet. Our activity-based model and advanced product platform are examples of winning strategy. Hoping for snow is not. That's why we're constantly ahead of the curve when it comes to anticipating and meeting the demands of our customers and consumers.", "In 2013, we will focus on 3 key pillars to continue to grow the franchise of the world's most powerful outdoor brand: Product, direct-to-consumer and marketing. First, product. We are seeing and leading a change in consumer behavior toward more contemporary, athletic styles for the outdoor category. Style and contemporary fit, color, lighter weight and multiuse are what consumers want in apparel while not sacrificing performance. This is exactly what you'll see in our product lineup in 2013, and it's where leading-edge innovations like Thermoball will make a big difference.", "Next is direct-to-consumer. Our e-commerce business continues to be fueled by our omni-channel model, which makes it easy for consumers to access our products whenever and however they choose. In-store and online, it's a digital ecosystem that puts them at the center. We're also continuing to open stores where consumers can experience firsthand the breadth and depth of our brand. At year-end, The North Face had 101 stores globally, which points to the opportunity to bring more consumers into our unique environments. And of course, becoming a better retailer helps us become a better wholesaler, as evidenced by the growing number of shop-in-shops we're building with key retail partners.", "Third is marketing. With the world's best outdoor athletes pushing the limits of human performance, we have great stories to engage our consumers. In 2013, our investments will be concentrated in-store and online through national and local media and supported by a growing number of grassroots events, which have proven critical to driving traffic and conversion in all channels of distribution.", "In terms of international growth, in 2013, we're looking forward to an even stronger mid-teen growth for The North Face, driven primarily by Asia, where we're expecting revenues to grow by over 30%. China presents a unique growth opportunity for The North Face, the opportunity to define and lead the outdoor category in this dynamic and growing market. New door openings are at the heart of our growth strategy in China, with plans to add 200 locations in 2013. This increase uses a new store format adapted from The North Face's global activity-based model and will bring our total door count for The North Face to more than 800 by year-end.", "We're also looking for a year of solid revenue growth in Europe. Despite very weak conditions, the health of The North Face brand has never been stronger. Our ongoing investments there are driving significant gains in total brand awareness and share increases in key markets that will result in high single-digit constant dollar growth for us in 2013. That growth should come from aggressive expansion in our direct-to-consumer presence. We'll open a significant number of stores this year, both owned and with partners, in such key markets as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Poland. And we're looking for explosive growth in our e-commerce business, given last year's launch in 6 new markets.", "Next up, Vans. Global revenues for Vans in 2012 were up 23% or 26% excluding the impact of foreign currency. In 2013, up a much larger base, we expect Vans to deliver another year of outstanding growth, with revenues expected to increase by nearly 20%. Last June in New York, we announced our 5-year plan for Vans, detailing the initiatives that will add $1 billion in new revenues by 2016. In 2013, our focus remains on the 4 key growth strategies we presented at that meeting: geographic expansion, deep consumer connectivity, product innovation and direct-to-consumer expansion.", "In the Americas, we'll execute our global geographic expansion strategy to access new markets here in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico and Latin America. Although Vans has been an integral part of the Southern California landscape for nearly 50 years, our presence on the East Coast and other key regions is quite young, representing an incredible long-term growth opportunity.", "Here in the Americas, we'll focus our efforts this year in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, as well as in key urban markets in Canada and Mexico. Vans expansion outside the Americas continues to be impressive, with revenue growth of more than 30% in constant dollars.", "Vans' international performance in 2012 is one of VF's biggest success stories. Europe was actually our fastest-growing market, with revenues rising more than 60% in constant dollars. And in Asia, revenues grew over 20% on a constant dollar basis. We're very focused on maintaining our momentum in both these markets, with total international growth of about 30% planned for Vans in 2013. In Europe, Vans' phenomenal growth should continue, with revenues expected to rise by over 30% this year. In fact, we expect Vans to become VF's second largest brand behind Timberland in Europe. It's a region where we're using our strength to press our advantage. We're expanding owned full-price stores. We're expanding partnership stores. We are prioritizing investments against top markets such as Germany. And we're investing in a new global marketing campaign.", "Next, deep consumer connectivity. Vans is a timeless brand that continues to resonate generation after generation because it stays grounded in action sports, art, music and youth culture, creating, inspiring and leading that conversation. In 2013, we plan to amplify our message with a new global brand campaign called \"Off the Wall is a state of mind.\" This new campaign will unify our global message and be heavily incorporated into our digital and interactive platforms, which are essential to reaching today's young consumers.", "Our next growth strategy is product innovation. Last year's LXVI launch, a product that blends the features of action sport shoes with traditional athletic shoes, was an important milestone for us, opening up a new channel of distribution we'll continue to build on in this year. In 2013, a prime example is the UltraCush Lite footwear with cushioning system. It's a custom blend of ultrasoft EVA foam that's lightweight, reduces foot fatigue and increases comfort.", "DtoC is a big part of Vans' growth story this year. I spoke earlier about expanding our retail footprint into new geographies. Last year, we launched a new global store format. It's been specifically designed to use the brand's heritage to tell locally relevant stories and has shown good results to-date. And like The North Face, Vans continues to be hyper-focused on its omni-channel vision, expanding and evolving our brick-and-mortar and click-and-order retail platforms to let consumers access Vans however they choose.", "DtoC is also a critical growth driver for Vans internationally, especially in emerging markets such as China. In fact, the first store to be retrofit with our new global store format was the Vans flagship store in Beijing, a change that drove 20% growth in same-store sales. In 2013, we plan to roll out this new format to more stores in China and use this as the foundation to leverage our newly owned business in South Korea. Our DtoC growth should be -- should support high-teen revenue growth in Asia this year for Vans.", "Now switching gears to Timberland. Full year Timberland revenues on a pro forma basis were up slightly in constant dollars. Timberland was also impacted by challenging economic conditions, especially in Europe, unseasonably warm weather and a cautious retail environment, which we expect to continue into this year.", "In 2013, we're expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth for Timberland on a global basis. And while things we can't control, like the economy and weather, are expected to temper the top line, we feel confident and in command of the things we can control. Our new product pipeline continues to gain momentum. We've got fantastic stories to tell, and our distribution channels are now well defined and much cleaner than in the past. And their inventories are well managed and appropriate to the environment.", "You may have a question about how we're tracking against the 10% CAGR we gave at the time of the Timberland acquisition. In 2013, our Americas and Asia businesses are right in line with this long-term target. But clearly, conditions in Europe, Timberland's largest market, are proving more difficult than we had originally anticipated.", "In 2013, we're targeting mid-single-digit growth. Our focus is on 4 key areas: Product innovation, marketing effectiveness, direct-to-consumer and geographic expansion. Starting with product. I'm happy to report that the work that we've done over the last year with our channel segmentation strategy and our go-to-market discipline has successfully returned the Timberland's yellow boot to iconic status, a status recognized by consumers and favored by our dealers. Our Hookset Handcrafted and the leather boat shoe collections continue to help build significant momentum in the important spring season and are exceeding our expectations.", "In 2013, we'll launch the Earthkeepers Heritage collection, which is an eco-friendly line of footwear, featuring legacy crafted details straight from the Timberland vault, combined with modern styling and comfort. We also have new additions to the Timberland Boot Company collection, our most premium line of footwear, featuring details like premium leather and hand-painted finishes that are inspired by a time when footwear was a tool built for a purpose.", "This fall, we're set to relaunch men's apparel in the U.S. with targeted specialty department stores, as well as with our own Timberland stores and online. This is a great opportunity for us to extend the brand's identity and authenticity. Although the launch will be intentionally small and modestly incremental to revenues, we have great confidence that this will stage -- will set the stage for our ultimate goal of adding $300 million in revenues to our existing $270 million global apparel business. We know you're eager to see it, so we're planning a preview sometime this summer.", "Turning to marketing. A new global campaign called \"Best then. Better now.\" will build on the brand's historic strength while delivering a new contemporary look and feel. It's very elegant, aspirational and brand building. Also we're planning to increase our investments in digital and print ads in a very focused manner to strengthen consumers' brand perception and drive wholesale and DtoC traffic.", "In terms of DtoC expansion, with new leadership in place and a focus on store-level KPIs, we're expecting high single-digit growth in the Americas, with improved profitability in full-price, outlet and e-commerce channels. And strengthened by digital marketing efforts and an overall site experience, we're expecting a near 50% increase in revenues for Timberland's e-commerce here in the Americas.", "On the international front, Timberland's international business is expecting slight revenue growth in 2013, with a mid-single-digit decline in Europe, where conditions in Italy, the brand's largest market, remain challenging. In Asia, we expect a mid-teen increase, a region where the brand continues to post consistently strong results.", "A major focus for us in 2013 will be the integration of Timberland into our European operations, a big move but critical to establishing our platform for future growth in Europe and improving profitability. We're also working to expand our successful partnerships to our program in Europe with the addition of 40 doors, bringing total doors to approximately 300 in the region, greatly increasing brand presence and visibility. In terms of our own doors, we're continuing to assess our current footprint with a keen eye towards improved profitability through increased conversion and traffic.", "In Asia, you'll recall that we announced a 13% compounded growth rate target over the next 5 years. And despite some softness in Japan, Timberland's largest Asian market, the brand grew double digits there in 2012. And we're expecting similar growth in 2013. And in China, where we're just getting started, revenues are expected to grow 30%. We're also excited to launch 6 new owned stores in Shanghai, an extremely influential city, where in conjunction with The North Face, we're leading the conversation on Outdoor.", "Now I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2012, global revenue for VF's Jeanswear business was up 2% or 4% in constant dollars, a performance that reflects a mid-single-digit increase in the Americas. In addition to the top line story, there is also a story of improving profitability for both Wrangler and Lee in every region of the world. Long-term growth prospects for our Jeanswear business remain strong. Near term, we'll be navigating challenging macro conditions globally. We're expecting modest growth in our global Jeanswear business this year, with our focus, front and center, on consumer-centric product innovation. Our pipeline of new products for 2013 and beyond is designed to bring style, function and performance benefits to consumers in all channels and regions.", "Starting with Wrangler, our highest-margin Western Specialty business should continue its momentum in 2013. Product innovation lies at the heart of our success in this business, with a portfolio of products to meet customer needs from Premium Performance Cowboy Cut for authentic cowboys to the Wrangler 20X Competition Jean for the more aspirational western lifestyle consumer. Not only are our key retail partners adding doors, but we're also growing our business outside the Western channel into sporting goods, outdoor and regional mid-tier locations.", "2013 should also mark another year of growth for our Mass business, driven by new products like Wrangler advanced comfort, which features denim that is both stronger and more flexible. We're also seeing great success with our Wrangler tops program. We also expect double-digit constant dollar growth in Wrangler Latin America to continue, fueled by retail expansion in Argentina and Chile.", "Wrangler's business in Europe remained challenging in 2012, although our profitability continued to improve. In 2013, we expect further improvement of profitability and are looking forward to the launch of a new product innovation, denim performance for men. Denim performance is focused on the functionality of jeans, a core part of the Wrangler's heritage, incorporating extra pockets, better breathability, better durability and water and stain resistance in both jeans and outerwear. Denim performance gives Wrangler a clear, defined, competitive advantage in the market.", "Taking a look at Lee. In 2012, global revenues were flat on a constant dollar basis. In 2013, we're expecting slight growth on a global basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. Our Lee Platinum label collection performed well in 2012, including a test with a major department store customer that was very successful. And we're looking forward to the continued expansion of our collection in 2013.", "The mid-tier remains challenged, but let me say this, we're not sitting back and waiting for recovery here. We are aggressively pursuing consumers with portfolio of innovative products that offer great fit, fashion and functional benefits. There's Perfect Fit for women and modern series for men as 2 examples of consumer-centric innovation. These new products will also help head the support of a new marketing campaign from a new agency.", "Internationally, in 2012, we saw an improvement in profitability in Europe. And in 2013, we expect continued improvement. Our Stretch Deluxe line has been a real bright spot there, delivering 15% growth in women's jeans in 2012. In 2013, we'll continue that momentum by focusing on our bestseller, a fit called Scarlett, which will be available in 25 new combinations of color and fabric, building on the success of Stretch Deluxe. We'll launch a collection for men called Blue Label or Premium by Lee. We've also continued to test Lee's new full-price model with a cluster of owned stores in Benelux. And we'll be launching a new partner store in Germany, Scandinavia and the U.K.", "In Asia, we talked about our long-term plans for the region in great detail back in September in Shanghai. In the near term, however, the jeanswear industry has been affected by efforts to right-size inventories, and Lee is not immune. Lee's performance in Asia will be particularly challenging in the first half and begin to normalize in the second half.", "In the meantime, our focus is on the innovative product, growing the number of doors, new marketing campaigns and expanding digital and e-commerce platforms.", "And now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about VF's Imagewear business. Imagewear is VF's third largest coalition and a consistent performer, having now delivered 11 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. In 2012, the business grew by 5%, with strength on both sides of the business, Image and Licensed Sports Group. In 2013, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth as well.", "Quickly, I'd like to touch on a few highlights of what's made Imagewear a consistent growth engine. Our success with Red Kap's new products in automotive workwear has opened up new channels of distribution, including retail.", "We're also partnering with the Wrangler brand to reach new untapped channel, B2B workwear. Wrangler Workwear is a new line of premium shirts, pants and outerwear loaded with innovative features to improve comfort and durability. After successful tests in 2012, we're planning for a much broader rollout.", "Finally, the Licensed Sports Group will continue to build its momentum with a new line of products within our Majestic, Authentic MLB collection. In further expansion of our successful lines of NFL apparel for men and women.", "And now Karen Murray will take you through the Sportswear coalition. Karen?", "Karen Murray", "Thank you, Scott. We're expecting revenues for the Sportswear coalition to increase at a high single-digit rate in 2013. Let's look a little deeper at where that growth will come from, starting with VF's sixth largest brand, Nautica.", "In 2013, revenues for the Nautica brand are expected to grow at a high single-digit rate. Nautica's key growth initiatives for 2013 are direct-to-consumer expansion and product innovation.", "Nautica's direct-to-consumer channel should see double-digit growth in 2013, driven by double-digit comp store growth, new store openings and exceptional e-commerce growth of over 50%. In fact, we plan to launch an entirely new Nautica website this year, a timely event given our 30th anniversary of the brand.", "Our next growth initiative is product innovation. We are continuing to develop a performance platform to differentiate the brand and provide new value to consumers. Products that feature water-oriented performance features, such as moisture-wicking, water-repellence and breathability currently make up 35% of our assortment. This will grow with the full 2013 introduction of elevated fashion performance products. In addition, we plan to expand our jeans offering in all doors to gain share in denim and with younger consumers.", "One final note on Nautica before I move on. We also expect heavy -- healthy double-digit growth in our licensed international business as we expand into 3 new emerging markets: Turkey, Russia and Brazil.", "Although we don't normally talk about Kipling, which is part of the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition internationally and Sportswear in the United States, the brand has become an increasingly larger and more important top and bottom line contributor for VF. Kipling is a fun global handbag and accessories brand with incredible strength. And as excited as we are about its near-term success, we're even more excited about its long-term growth prospects.", "In 2013, we expect Kipling to grow global revenues at a low double-digit rate, fueled by strong growth in every region of the world, including more than a 30% increase expected in the United States. Kipling's U.S. direct-to-consumer business, which represents more than half of the brand's U.S. revenues, is expected to see exceptional growth in 2013 fueled on both the retail and e-commerce fronts. We are testing a new full-price retail store concept, and e-commerce will contribute significantly, aided by the launch of a new website and a global digital marketing campaign. Kipling's successful exclusive handbag partnership with Macy's is expected to continue to grow in 2013 as we add new products, expand it to new doors and work to expand our presence with this important partner.", "Kipling is famous for its crinkled nylon, and we see plenty of white space for product innovation within and beyond this material. In 2013, we're looking at metallic, patent leather and lacquer materials. And we plan to introduce new product categories, such as backpacks, scarves, hats, umbrellas and jewelry.", "In summary, our coalition is in a very different place today than it was just a few short years ago. We're seeing significant acceleration in our top line growth and profitability. Our momentum is set, and we are on a roll.", "Now my colleague, Susan Kellogg, will take you through Contemporary Brands.", "Susan Kellogg", "All right, everyone, rest assured, we're almost done. In 2012, excluding the John Varvatos brand, which we sold in April, Contemporary Brands North America revenue were up 9%, with solid results from 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and the Ella Moss brands. In 2013, we're expecting our high single-digit growth to continue, starting with 7 For All Mankind. The brand's key growth initiatives are similar to what you've heard throughout the call today: Product innovation, direct-to-consumer expansion and deeper engagement with the consumers.", "On the product innovation front, in 2013, we plan to introduce 2 new fabric innovations: Slim Illusion second skin for women and lux performance in casual denim for men. Slim Illusion second skin is a proprietary denim with 100% elasticity, which means it will keep its shape, fit and feel throughout the life of the product. Lux performance is stretch distressed denim for men that combines the rugged look men want with unsurpassed comfort while also returning -- retaining its shape for the life of the product.", "Next is direct-to-consumer expansion, fueled by high single-digit comp growth and expected 20% increase in e-com revenue. We're also excited about launching our China website later this year and are looking forward to engaging consumers in this important market.", "Finally, we're creating deeper engagement with consumers by telling evocative stories in a new way, enabled by digital technology and social media. Building on our success from last year, we're bringing back Oscar-nominated actor and film maker, James Franco, to create our 2012 marketing campaign. But there's a new twist. Instead of making films that you simply watch, we've created a new interactive experience that allows consumers to view the story one part at a time and vote on how they want it to unfold. We'll use this content to surround our millennial consumer and build our brand affinity and fuel our top and bottom line growth.", "Next, our Splendid and Ella Moss brands that, on a combined basis, continue to post strong double-digit revenue growth year-after-year. Splendid's growth will be driven by aggressive DTC expansion. In fact, we expect DTC revenues to nearly double for the second consecutive year. We plan to open more than 15 new owned stores in 2013. Every store helps drive healthy brand awareness, which we know helps us win in all of our channels. Splendid and Ella Moss are just getting started, and the pace of their growth is very encouraging. And when you combine the potential of fast growing brands with VF's scale, distribution and operational efficiency, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity for future growth.", "In summary, we're looking forward to a great year of combined and continued brand momentum, coupled with game-changing innovation across all of our Contemporary Brands.", "And now I'll hand it back over to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Susan. That concludes our prepared remarks. But before we open the line for questions, I'd to take a moment to thank a member of our team, who recently announced her decision to retire at the end of March, Cindy Knoebel. Cindy began her career at VF in 1993 to establish our vendor relations function. Over the last 20 years, she's continued to add new responsibilities to her role, including corporate communications, public relations and sustainability. Throughout her career here at VF, Cindy's communication skills and strategic insights have been instrumental in building strong support for VF's strategic transformation by fostering strong relationships with the company's employees and investors and the media. Almost everyone on this call knows Cindy, and many of you know her well, so you know she'll be greatly missed. Please join me in thanking Cindy for everything she's done for us and for you. And we're wishing her the very best as she begins a new chapter in her life.", "And of course, you already know Lance Allega, our Director of Investor Relations who joined us last time -- last year at this time. He will now be leading VF's investor relations functions, so also join me in congratulating Lance.", "And with that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Cindy will be happy to take all of your questions today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Cindy, congratulations.", "Cindy Knoebel", "Thanks, Bob.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, Eric, the 2 questions that I have, I guess, relate around the Outdoor business a little bit. When you look at the top line that you've driven, especially at The North Face versus the industry, it's been pretty impressive. And I was just wondering if you guys can comment around inventory levels at retail, mainly around The North Face. But I would also be interested just to understand inventories of Timberland product and especially as it looks to the mid-single-digit growth rate for 2013 that you expect in Timberland.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Bob, Steve will take that question for you.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, so Bob, inventory, I mean, the channel, we really have 2 stories here, the TNF inventory is higher than we have seen historically. I think the good news is the last 4 or 5 weeks since December, week 5, cold weather has returned to much of the U.S., and we've seen really nice increases in retail sell-through. Timberland really came through, fourth quarter, in a much, much cleaner situation and enters this year with very clean inventories in all of their channels.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And then what we'd also say there, Bob, is that in Europe, inventories are probably a little cleaner than that, a little better shape.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "With regards to The North Face and maybe any potential changes that could be anticipated over the next couple of years, how should we think of your product mix flowing throughout the winter season? Does it impact margins at all? And are you converting or changing your sourcing with regards to The North Face in the near term?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Kate, so I'll take that one as well. The product mix stays very similar to what you've seen in the European market. Cold-weather apparel continues to be very important, especially in the northern region and some of the emerging markets. Here in the U.S., and as well as in Europe, we do see an increase in more contemporary athletic silhouettes which will, we believe, with our focus on the activity-based model and the learnings we have from our running, training [ph] business, we're well on the forefront of evolving our collections to meet that new consumer demand. We do see an increase in the lighter weight, what we call transitional weight insulated goods. That's made of synthetic insulations, down insulations, as well as fleeces. And again, we're well on the path of being on the front end of that trend. Margins in these categories remain the same, so there really is no change there. And our sourcing model here in Asia, as well as here in the Americas, remains the same and is well placed to be able to service what we consider will be increasing demand.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Kate, I'll add one thing to that. If you think about the short term, the next 12 months for The North Face brand, our fastest growth rate will be in Asia, followed by Europe and followed by the U.S. Another way to slice that is to say our direct-to-consumer business is going to grow faster than our wholesale business. All of those facts point to higher margins for The North Face. The mix in geographies and the mix in channels will -- should expand our gross margins next year -- gross and operating margins next year.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And I forgot to say congratulations to Cindy and to Lance.", "Lance Allega", "Thanks, Kate.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Cindy, we'll miss you. A couple questions. First, on The North Face and timing of shipments, are retailers reticent to take inventories as early as they have in the past? Should we expect any shift in revenue from 3Q to 4Q in the U.S. business like we saw in Europe in 2012?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, so Jim, this is Steve. Timing of shipments, I don't really see a dramatic shift here or in Europe. I think what you'll see is just a more cautious prebook. And consumers -- or our retailers looking to take deliveries closer to demand. But timing should remain the same, and no dramatic shifts quarter-to-quarter.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Shifting gears a bit to Sportswear, great improvement there in the operating margin for the year. Sounds like good momentum in the direct-to-consumer. Should we expect the momentum in the operating margin improvement to continue for that coalition in '13?", "Karen Murray", "Yes, you should.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Bob, care to elaborate on that?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, he should.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Jim, actually, I'll expand just a little bit, right? So actually, in both the Sportswear, as well as Contemporary, we've seen really nice improvement. And for 2013, we expect those businesses to improve to the low and even closer to the mid-teen operating margin levels, with a 15% operating margin clearly in our sight. So yes, we're seeing a lot of opportunity there for continued and significant improvement.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "In both.", "Robert K. Shearer", "In both.", "Operator", "And Michael Binetti with UBS will have our next question.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you give us an idea of the -- what the Timberland operating margins look like in the quarter and what the Timberland operating margins are that are implied in the plus-100-basis-point guidance for the company for 2013, please?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, I'll handle that. I'll talk about for the year, Michael, for 2012. We started the year saying that we thought our operating margin for Timberland would be in the 10% to 11% area, and that's where we ended up. We were just above 10% actually in 2012. For 2013, what we're looking at is, as you'd expect, where you expect to grow our gross margins in 2013. But Steve mentioned something in his comments that there are a couple areas that we're going to be spending against, and those are in product, in the product development area, as well as we're going to up the marketing spend there as well. So improved gross margin in 2013, exactly what we need to see, but the operating margin will remain relatively flat, maybe up just a little bit from what we saw in 2012 because of the spend.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just 2 quick follow-ups here. Could you just help us out, the order book you're seeing for the big brands, Vans and North Face, for the spring?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. So order book for our Vans business is quite strong, which is leading us to the guidance we gave for the brand, both here and in Europe. And order book in The North Face is moderate, as you might expect, with the caution that we see in our dealer base, both in the U.S. and Asia. I mean, in Europe. But our Asia business is quite strong. So just up slightly, right in line with how we've guided the brand.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And one -- just one last one. Eric, is there any opportunity to do -- to start talking about a shop-in-shop with JCPenney this year? We've had the Vans product and the Lee product in there historically, and some of the competitor sales brands has -- look like they've signed up for some distribution there under the new store format. I wanted to see if there was an update there for us.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, that's a great question, and we are in active discussions right now with Penneys about what a Lee shop or a Vans shop might look like and when they might appear, but I don't have an update on exactly when that will be.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And congrats to Cindy and Lance as well.", "Lance Allega", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Best of luck, Cindy. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits you saw from the step-up in advertising? And then also, you've indicated that advertising as a percent of sales will also increase in '13. Should we expect that to be back-end weighted?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, the -- we measure -- actually, for all of our big brands, we measure the impact of our investments behind those brands. And your question was about advertising. We obviously measure that. We have a pretty good feel. We measure it year-after-year by media type, and each brand knows what their consumer responds to. And because of that, that's why our ad spend has increased consistently over the last 4 or 5 years and why our investment is going up another 30 basis points this year. We think now is a great year to do that because we're expecting consumers to take a little coaxing to get them to engage with brands, and we're in a position to do that. The seasonal mix really varies by brand. For our Jeans business in the U.S., it's really important that we hit back-to-school hard. For our colder weather brands, it's important that we hit the third quarter, and the holiday quarter's important for everyone. I hope that helped.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.", "Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about -- for The North Face, you talked a little bit about the, I guess, merchandising, some of the lighter-weight transitional goods, maybe the activity-based model helping, is -- I'm thinking is kind of this weather is here to stay, the global warming type conversations. How about for the Timberland brand? I think the new apparel that's coming in the U.S. is more outerwear-focused. Maybe you could talk if for that brand, there are conversations on the merchandising side to be kind of more versatile, seasonless maybe as well.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. So I think it's important to note that our apparel business in Europe is the strongest in any of the regions. And our international business, we're about a $220 million business. Here in the U.S., as we look to relaunch the brand and very thoughtfully through select specialty and department store partners, we'll be placing outerwear but also a very robust collection of sportswear. So I think you can think about a really balanced approach of sportswear and outerwear, natural fibers, cottons and leathers and more of that rugged outdoor feel that you would expect from Timberland.", "Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then second question is on the M&A front. Are you still focused -- I think you've said in the past, the Outdoor & Action Sports area? Or is there any interest in the contemporary areas you've looked into before, even more footwear now that you have the Timberland and the footwear expertise with that?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I think the answers to your question are yes, yes and yes. All of those are areas that we're exploring. We clearly have been focused in the Outdoor & Action Sports area, and we've talked about that as being our priority. But in each of our coalitions, we understand where there are opportunities for us to add to the portfolio in a really accretive way to the portfolio. In other words, giving us either a skill set or a product category that reaches the consumer in a different way. That's how each coalition thinks about it. And our focus has been on Outdoor & Action Sports, but that doesn't mean we're only looking at that area.", "Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and congrats to Cindy and Lance as well.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the Asia growth rate comments, as we've seen that compress over the last quarter and then kind of a little bit more of a tempered guide for next year in the low-teens range. You highlighted the inventory in the channel with respect to the jeans market in China. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in that market in particular there? And then how do you think about the competitive space broadly in China in that Outdoor segment at this point? Have you seen any inventory creepage in that channel there? Are you still pretty pleased with that performance?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure, great question. We -- in September, when we were in Shanghai, we guided that we thought we could grow Asia 17% compounded over the next 5 years. And now we're talking about a low-teen rate for 2013, and it really is solely -- the sole issue we have is our inventory in our Jeanswear -- in the industry and with our brand as well. If you look at our other businesses in China, The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Kipling, they are all on track to the kind of growth rates we talked about in September. Jeanswear, with the Lee brand in particular, was the first brand we launched there. For example, it's got a 12-year head start on The North Face. One was launched in '95, the other in 2007. So it has much broader distribution than Lee does, much broader distribution, many more touch points with consumers and a lot more inventory in the space. And that's where we have this short-term issue. We expect to work through that issue in the first half of the year, begin to gain growth momentum in the second half of the year and be back on track in 2014 with the kind of growth rates we talked about. U.S., the second question, I forgot it, sorry. Can you repeat it?", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I just -- yes, sorry, I was just asking about...", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Oh, the outdoor.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "The competitive landscape in the outdoor space and if you've seen any kind of inventory creepage there as well.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, we have not seen in our brand with -- that's really -- our focus there has been primarily on The North Face until recently, obviously, when we acquired Timberland. So we now think we have a great -- we're in a great position to shape the conversation about outdoor in China. And we have not seen an inventory issue with either of our brands, and I'm not aware of an inventory build with other brands.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Bob, let me start with you. Just you gave a little color on the sales growth by quarter and you mentioned that Q1 is the toughest comparison. So in light of the 6% growth that you're looking for the year, kind of where do you think Q1 falls in? I mean, are you talking sort of low single digits? And then also, I was hoping for a little color on kind of the operating margin cadence. You've got your easiest kind of op margin comparison in the first quarter, with Jeanswear still having been impacted by the input costs. And I was kind of wondering how we should think about that. And I have a follow-up.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Mitch, the -- to the first question relative to the first quarter, yes, we could be a few percentage points off the 6%. That's what we expect, a few percentage points below the 6% rate that we talked about for the year. In terms of the cadence of margins, you're absolutely right. Maybe I'll talk about both gross margin, as well as operating margin. We expect to see the strongest comparison in the first quarter from a gross margin standpoint, which is what you'd expect, right? We're up against -- we're comping against the highest costs of the year in -- especially in the denim side of things in 2012 in the first quarter. So that should be the strongest comp from a gross margin standpoint. But at the operating margin line, because of the significant growth, particularly on the direct-to-consumer side in the fourth quarter, that's where we expect to see the strongest expansion in operating margin.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then a follow-up for Steve on Timberland. A couple of things there. One, could you talk a little bit about kind of where would Q4 sales have come in, if there's some way you can adjust for the distribution changes that you've seen? And those distribution changes, do those continue to be a bit of a top line headwind as we go through 2013? And then also, could you talk about the impact of apparel on the business in 2013? I mean, just in terms of relaunching in North America, I mean, is there any way you can sort of assign a dollar value to that in terms of kind of incremental revenues?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Mitch, I'll do my best to answer this question without really being able to give you dollar values, which I know you're looking for. The distribution changes that we enacted, we started at the beginning of the year, it's hard for me to put a number on it. I can tell you that it absolutely did have an impact in our sales, but so did our store closures, as well as less closeout inventory, which the brand would've shown historically. So it did have an impact, but it wasn't the major driver. Impact from our apparel, as I've mentioned in my comments, will be very minimal. We're being very thoughtful and very selective in how we launch the new product here in the United States. We want to position it with the best specialty and department store players so as to really position the brand and give the product the right theater to be presented and to be supported by the footwear. So sales will be very minimal. The growth next year will come from our footwear, as well as the growth that I mentioned in DtoC and wholesale.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, got it. Good and thanks for everything, Cindy.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So as we dig deeper overseas, can you speak to your level of enthusiasm in Europe next year and also, in-sale brand or category opportunities as we look forward over there?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure, I'll take that. This is Eric. Our expectation for next year in Europe is for a high single-digit increase. So I step back from that and say we're really taking share in Europe. We're doing that because of our portfolio of brands and the different -- the number of countries we do business in. We clearly have some countries that are really challenging. We've talked about Italy, it's a tough place to sell apparel and footwear right now. And we have brands, though, that are, on the other end of the spectrum, really delivering in Europe, like Vans did for us in 2012 and will again. So while there are challenges, what we've done is look at which brands are in which markets and where are the opportunities to invest, and we're investing with real focus behind Vans in markets like the U.K., Germany and France, and in other brands where there's an opportunity to grow. And that'll help us navigate through the European challenges right now and deliver high single-digit increases in a really tough space.", "Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's great. And then second question, your inventory levels, very tightly managed. We haven't seen levels like this for a couple years. How should we think about how you're managing this across brands? And then what is the game plan looking forward from an inventory perspective?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, we manage our inventories pretty similarly across brands. And obviously, the retail component of any individual business has some bearing in terms of our overall inventory levels. But this was a year -- actually glad you referenced it. This was a year where we are -- I guess, we put some extra focus on our inventories and we saw -- we really saw a great progress. We have very, very frequent face-to-face conversations about inventory. As I see some smiles around the room here from our group folks and presidents. And it's just an area that we just put a lot of focus and have been able to put or make an awful lot of improvements. So for 2013, we will continue to do the same. Actually, in our cash guidance, our assumption is that inventories will generally grow. After the reduction in 2012, we'll pretty much grow with revenues. However, I can tell you that we'll push hard to do a little bit better than that relative to our overall inventory. There is still some room for improvement.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, I'm going to weigh in on this because I want to give a shout out to our supply chain and front-end guys. They're working together on a new process that looks at our inventory in a different way, and they're doing that across every business unit in every geography. And part of it is a new process, and that's let us grow our business like we did last year and still take $100 million out of inventory and service at a high level. And kudos to them for coming up with a new process and making it stick.", "Operator", "And next, we'll hear from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I'll add my congrats to Cindy. Really appreciate the help throughout the years. And congrats to Lance as well. Eric, I guess, if I could for you, just broader on the domestic front sort of beyond the seasonality issues. So on your macro, you're going to have the various potential sort of tailwinds versus some of the headwinds on the tax front or energy costs, sort of what your expectation here is domestically?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Well, we read the same stuff you do, Eric, about how economists see the U.S. economy, and the question is how are people going to react to changes in tax rates and changes in healthcare costs and all that. And clearly, there are going to be pressures on disposable income in America. That seems pretty much laid out. In that environment, we have a mid-single growth -- mid-single-digit growth rate kind of baked into our assumption for this year. We think that's taking share as well, similar to the way I answered the Europe question. We really look across our portfolio of brands and ask, where can we win? And where we think we can, we try to distort our investment to ensure we do. And that's how we think we can deliver a mid-single-digit growth rate in an economy that's clearly not going to grow that quickly. We still have some challenges to get through here. Fortunately, VF is going to get through them pretty well.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe, Steve, for you on Timberland, maybe just a little bit more color in terms of the, I guess, sort of soft launch on the apparel side for fall this year. I know it's going to be tight, but sort of the expectations for what that contributes. And I think you said sort of the incremental $300 million, maybe just speak to, again, the timing cadence of that.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. So just I think to restate, the launch here in the United States is on top of a very robust apparel business internationally. We have a very select number of new specialty and department store partners. We'll place it very thoughtfully with the whole focus of getting strong profitable sell-through with our retail partners so we build a platform for the future. That $300 million that we mentioned at point of acquisition is over a 5-year horizon. That would take you then through 2016, where we look to add that incremental growth across the global apparel business.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe last for Bob. Is it possible to quantify the 100 basis points of gross margins in sort of the various buckets? Again, the mix shifts, I get, are driving it. But maybe just between that, lower input costs, just walk us through and quantify for '13.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, Eric. The -- it's actually going to be a pretty consistent story here over the past several years. And we talked about this a lot, that our mix shift has been providing us 60 to 70 basis points of improvement in our gross margin very consistently every year, and it's exactly what we expect for 2013 as well. The remainder are, in fact, product costs. Some lower product costs, Jeanswear is a component of that, to be sure, so is Imagewear, which had some higher product costs in 2012. So it's 60 to 70 for mix and the remainder coming from product costs.", "Operator", "And we do have time for one final question. Next, we'll hear from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Lance, congratulations. And Cindy, definitely a shout out for such an amazing tenure. I think you do go down as a legend in IR, in the sector, not just for the tenure and the duration, but obviously, the excellence as well. So congrats to you both. I wanted to ask you about -- obviously, VF over the years really has been the company that's kind of almost pioneered this idea of the lifestyle brand in the apparel sector. Certainly coming out of North America, done a tremendous job building lifestyle brands over time. Can you talk about -- the area where you've had probably the most success is in the Outdoor & Action Sports. Are you -- how are you thinking about the lifestyle of Outdoor & Action Sports? Are you seeing any changes in how consumers are thinking about that lifestyle? Is it becoming more subtle? Is it becoming more segmented across different types of outdoor sports and action sports? What are you guys seeing in that marketplace from a lifestyle perspective?", "Steven E. Rendle", "So Omar, I'll take a shot at this, and Eric can fill in if I miss something. I think the outdoor lifestyle, which we've certainly been at the forefront of helping create and certainly benefit from, continues to be on the forefront of consumer minds. We look a lot at macro trends across all of the regions. And healthy lifestyle, fitness and kind of that whole notion of getting back to simplicity really plays into the historical strengths of the outdoor industry. We do see really strong influence of action sports, as well as athletic coming in and speaking to a broad number of our consumers. And I mentioned how we're looking at that athletic trend and what that means to outdoor apparel becoming more lighter weight, more contemporary in its fit while maintaining that core function. But I think the key here also is that action sports, that lifestyle component that, that plays into, that again, our Vans business has been very strong at helping shape and is again at the forefront of being able to maximize that.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Omar, one thing that the Vans guys have done that quite frankly just impresses me beyond speech almost is they have kept that brand relevant to youth for over 40 years. And they've done that by not trying to speak to a customer but by speaking to youth. And they understand youth need to be individually expressive and creative, and they've changed their message and how they do that, customized it to each new generation. And that's why they're still relevant and leading with youth around the world.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then maybe on a related topic, it was interesting to hear you're going to accelerate marketing spend and store openings. How are you thinking about that? What gives you the confidence to do that? It's great to hear it, obviously, from a brand standpoint, but any update or thoughts there would be helpful.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure, Omar. We went back to our thinking in 2010, and you were following us then, and you know that we increased our investment -- our brand investment number by $100 million that year because we thought the economy was going to be a little wobbly and that we had the brands and the products to make a difference and accelerate our performance. And we think this is going to be that kind of year as well. We know our retail formats work. They're tested and proven. And as I mentioned earlier to someone else's question, we measure the effectiveness of our marketing, so we know which messages work and which don't. And we're going to distort our investments behind brands in geographies with proven retail formats and proven marketing communication. And we think that formula is going to help us get through this pretty difficult time in the global economy.", "Operator", "And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "No, just thank you, all, for joining us. We're really excited about 2013. We think we've got all the pieces in motion to deliver another great year, and we're blessed by having a legend in Investor Relations in the room today, and we wish her well as all of you do.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss VF's first quarter 2013 results.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements under the definition of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates.", "Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions]", "And now I'll turn the call over to VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 is off to a great start for us with results beating our expectations. Consistent with what we told you in February, our first quarter revenue growth rate was a few points below our full year target of 6%. And as we've seen over the last year, our diverse model continues to deliver great bottom line results, especially from our lifestyle brands and our international and direct-to-consumer businesses. In fact, our record earnings per share in the first quarter was a little better than our expectations. And with record revenues and record gross margin, it's another fantastic quarter for VF.", "During the quarter, our Outdoor & Action Sports business grew revenues by 10% amid concerns about fluctuating weather conditions impacting our cold-weather brands. Our international business was up 6%, despite continued economic weakness in Europe and an inventory overhang in China. And our direct-to-consumer business rose 12% with strength both here and abroad, even in a generally sluggish macro environment.", "While the economic environment is, overall, a headwind, we are very encouraged and proud of the consistent improvement in our profitability. Both gross and operating margins showed substantial expansion over the prior year's first quarter with gross margin up 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin rising by 130 basis points. Together, this growth in profitability enabled VF to deliver a 25% improvement in adjusted earnings per share to $2.43.", "Looking to the balance of 2013. With a slightly stronger-than-expected start to the year, we're raising our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $0.05 per share to $10.75. With 3 quarters still ahead of us and many dynamics at play, we feel it's prudent to maintain a fairly cautious approach to guidance while we continue to seek and invest in new opportunities for long-term growth.", "And speaking of long-term growth, it was a little over 2 years ago that we got on stage in New York and took you through our 5-year plan. By every measure, revenues, margins and earnings per share, we're well ahead of the 2015 plan we presented then. So it's time to get back on stage, which is exactly what we plan to do on June 11 in New York, where we'll take you through the next 5 years of VF strategies and the performance you can expect us to deliver.", "But back to 2013. This is the year of opportunity, opportunities to strengthen our brands, to innovate more meaningfully and to connect with and reach even more consumers. Our diverse portfolio of brands, backed by deep consumer insights and the relentless focus on operational excellence, is built to inspire consumers and generate consistent returns for our shareholders.", "We continue to invest thoughtfully and consistently behind key drivers of top and bottom line growth, and these investments are certainly paying off. So with a great start, the right strategies and superior execution, we're looking forward to delivering another outstanding year to our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott who will take us through the top 5 VF brands, and then Bob will close out with a deeper dive into our financial results. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Eric. First quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 6%, fueled by very strong growth in the brand's D2C business, which increased 25%. Globally, we also saw a slight increase in our wholesale business. In the Americas region, revenue was up 3%, helped by winter weather that arrived mid-January and continued until just recently.", "In fact, our D2C performance was strong in the quarter, up low double digits and the highest comps in over a year, driven by solid sell-through of winter-related apparel, including insulated jacket, fleece and shells, as well as spring-weight rainwear and performance athletic apparel, clearly evidence that The North Face brand is strong and its product coveted as the industry's best, all of which gives us confidence that we have a great year ahead of us.", "Looking out towards fall, as expected, retailers have remained cautious with their orders, which were in line with our expectations. So definitely a good start to 2013 and great confidence in our ability to achieve high single-digit revenue growth for the full year.", "As I outlined on our year-end call, we are focused on 3 key areas to grow The North Face brand in 2013: product innovation, marketing and D2C. And with the first quarter behind us, we're definitely firing on all cylinders in these initiatives.", "First up, product. Product innovation is at the core of The North Face DNA. It motivates performance, stirs adventure and inspires people to get outdoors. Building on the success of our activity-based model, we've got a great new collection due out this fall known as Steep Series. This brand-new premier line of snowsports apparel is inspired by our expedition-level products and will be complementary to our outdoor Summit Series collection. Featured this fall in ski specialty shops, our own stores and online, Steep Series will help further position The North Face winter action sports products as a natural extension to the core brand.", "And of course, we're really looking forward to this fall's launch of Thermoball, a product innovation we see as a real game changer and a core component of our Science of Warmth technology platform. Thermoball offers versatility for a variety of conditions and will play a major role in our amplified transitional outerwear offering this fall.", "Finally, our Flash Dry technology, an amazing innovation designed to improve moisture management and temperature regulation, continues to be included in our increasingly greater number of styles and is exceeding our expectations.", "And hot off the presses, we just learned that 7 products from The North Face were named among the best recommendations from the Outside Magazine in their 2013 Buyer's Guide. From our Casimir 36 backpack and 4 different jackets, to our new Hyper-Track Guide trail running shoes and the MICA FL tent, which won the Gear of the Year Award, very exciting callouts and further confirmation that our activity-based model and focus on innovation is paying off.", "On the marketing and D2C fronts, we're planning a significant acceleration in investments behind our digital and online branding efforts to help drive brand awareness and increase conversion in our own stores. We've also made great progress on improving The North Face omni-channel experience. This initiative enables consumers to research and view products online, pay for them and then pick them up at their local North face store. It also allows quick, easy and free web purchase exchanges in all of our retail stores, a very important and seamless feature to create a great shopping experience. Such a great experience, in fact, that Forbes Magazine recently recognized The North Face app as the highest in customer satisfaction.", "We're also working to better leverage our loyalty and CRM programs. We've seen early success with The North Face VIP program, which combines web and store transactions to accumulate points towards future transactions. With more than 100,000 members already in our system, we have a 2-way conversation with shoppers that purchase more frequently, have higher dollar baskets and are clearly the most hard-core brand evangelists we have.", "And the great news is our marketing and consumer awareness efforts are paying off. In fact, our latest annual brand equity score improved markedly in 2012 from 2011, which validates the increasing momentum and relevance of The North Face brand with consumers. So with amazing innovations, supported by great marketing and an elevated retail experience, there's a lot to look forward to for The North Face brand in 2013.", "Now here's Karl Heinz to run through the international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Outside the Americas, The North Face brand grew 11% with balanced strength on a DTC and wholesale basis.", "In Europe, The North Face saw a modest increase in revenues, driven by strong results from our DTC business, offset by a modest decline in the wholesale channel. In fact, The North Face DTC business in Europe was a real bright spot in the quarter with nearly 30% growth, including more than 30% growth in online sales. Although the overall consumer environment remains soft in Europe, our DTC comps were up at low double-digit rate, which demonstrates the brand is strong and gaining share against our competitors. We are confident to say that we believe that The North Face is the best positioned brand in the outdoor industry in Europe.", "On the product front, given the great product innovations mentioned by Steve, as well as our European Daypack [ph] collection and the strong equipment offering, we are quite pleased with consumer reception and growing brand awareness. And specifically, we see robust opportunities for European-specific fits, colors and regional-relevant product to create an even greater connection with our consumers' active lifestyles.", "And speaking of connecting with consumers, we continue to find great ways to share our brand story and engage them on many levels. A highlight from this winter was our sponsorship of the Freeride World Tour, the world's premier big mountain, freeskiing and snowboarding competition, where our athletes won the men's snowboard and men's skis competition. This tour was viewed live by over 300,000 people with hundreds of videos and articles available online and in print.", "Turning to Asia. We continue to see excellent momentum for The North Face brand with revenues up nearly 40%, driven primarily by outstanding growth in China partner expansion and a larger spring-summer product offering. In China, we opened 20 new partner doors and successfully converted Hong Kong to an owned market during the quarter, which added an additional 60 partner doors. Our efforts here are also focused on building brand awareness and engaging consumers around the outdoors. In fact, we recently hosted the largest amateur ski and snowboard competition in China with more than 400 participants.", "We're also currently executing on integrated marketing campaign to promote our spring Summit Series and hiking footwear. The industry best products, improving retail experience and leading the outdoor conversation with consumers gives us great confidence in 2013.", "Now let's move onto Vans. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Global revenue for Vans in the first quarter was up 25% with strong double-digit growth in all 3 regions, including both the wholesale and D2C businesses. This impressive performance puts the brand well on track to become VF's second largest brand in 2013 behind The North Face.", "Momentum continued in the Americas region, with more than 20% growth on revenues balanced across our D2C and wholesale channels. Of particular note in our wholesale business are very strong sell-throughs of men's apparel, a business that is gaining significant momentum. In fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's up more than 50%. It's a great sign that our styles and efforts to connect with consumers are working in concert to drive substantial growth.", "On the footwear side, we continue to perform very well. In many cases, Vans is the top performer in many of our key accounts. Building on our core classics business with new materials, prints and collaborations, from Metallica to Marvel Comics, and new styles, such as the Authentic Hi, we are broadening the opportunities for growth in our core business.", "As you know, one of our key growth drivers is geographic expansion. This strategy, with particular focus on the East Coast in 2013, is an ongoing success. By working closely with key partners and opening our own retail stores, using aggressive target-city marketing and providing product innovation in weatherized classic Vans footwear and apparel, we are driving awareness and affinity for Vans in big important new markets.", "We continue to excel on the consumer connectivity front as well, engaging consumers in creative activity-based ways. The best and most recent example is the Vans Custom Culture national high school art competition. The contest, which is in its fourth year, drew more than 1,400 entries from high school art classes in all 50 states. Charged with creating a work of art from a blank pair of Vans shoes, this year's winner will be crowned at the Whitney Museum in New York in June, receiving $50,000 to support that school's commitment to art.", "Continuing to focus on geographic expansion and consumer connectivity, we also successfully launched the first stage of our new global brand campaign called Anthem. The Anthem campaign seeks to significantly increase brand awareness through a unified global effort, which centralizes the historical authenticity of Vans Off the Wall culture.", "And finally, we're hard at work laying plans as the new sponsor of the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach in July. As the largest surf contest of its kind in the U.S., we can't wait to bring Vans Off the Wall culture to the epicenter of surf.", "Now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz who will take us through some international highlights.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Outside the Americas, Vans revenues were up 30% with similar wholesale growth and DTC growth north of 40%. In the first quarter, Vans continued its outstanding momentum in Europe with revenue up more than 30%. We continue to see strong share gains in this crucial market, which gives us great confidence that we'll deliver another year of impressive growth. So impressive, in fact, that Vans is on track to become VF's second largest brand in Europe behind Timberland this year.", "Our efforts to drive Vans Off the Wall culture deeper into Europe are also proving successful. We have House of Vans Berlin in January, hosting 3 nights of music, photography, skate culture and street fashion. This event drew almost 5,000 attendees with 370,000 visitors participating via live webcast. This event served to bring youth culture together, a unique opportunity for us to educate consumers about our products amid a backdrop of music and art, ultimately creating a deeper emotional connection with the Vans brand.", "During the quarter, we opened stores in Paris, Maastricht, Glasgow and D\u00fcsseldorf and underwent a major retrofit of our economy store in London to showcase our new Vans retail concept.", "Vans Asian business also posted strong results in the first quarter, growing more than 20%. Here we have seen success with product collaboration that have regional and local aspects, such as our Year of the Snake product line in China. These products have proven to be very effective in ensuring that the brand remains relevant in the region and inspirational to the youth culture there. Here, too, we're using special events like the House of Vans experience, as we've hosted in Europe, to drive consumer interest and lead the conversation of youth culture.", "Also, I'm very happy to report that we successfully converted South Korea to an owned market during the quarter, an exciting country for future growth. Overall, a great start to the year for Vans globally and much more to come.", "With that, let's move on to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thanks, K.H. In line with our expectations, global revenues for Timberland were up 2% in the first quarter. As we start our second full year of VF ownership, we're very pleased with the progress we're making against our strategic initiatives to position the brand for long-term growth. Our expectations for full year revenue growth remain in the mid-single digit constant dollar range. In the Americas, revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. With more seasonably weather -- seasonable weather conditions and efforts around rigorous product segmentation and rightsizing distribution, Timberland is gaining traction with growth in the brand's D2C and wholesale businesses.", "On the product front, both core and new programs performed well, demonstrating what we believe to be a genuine interest in both heritage and new styles. The men's boots business saw a great success due to a combination of proactive inventory and style management. A great example of this is dividends classic yellow boot, which achieved strong growth at full price in the quarter, reinforcing and underscoring its iconic status.", "That said, Timberland is not relying solely on its product archives to drive growth. New styles like the Stormbuck Lite Oxford and Newmarket Cupsole 2.0 saw great results in the first quarter following well-supported launches. These products embody a successful blend of classic and new, which is the backbone of Timberland's Best Then. Better Now marketing campaign. The new campaign, which is set to launch this fall, marks the celebration of the company's 40th anniversary.", "On the Timberland PRO side, we're also building momentum with great innovations like our Anti-Fatigue Technology and new products like Hyperion and Boondock. PRO continues to set the standard for the comfort and protection needs of this very demanding industrial consumer.", "Timberland's D2C business achieved strong double-digit growth in the quarter. More favorable weather and our targeted operational initiatives designed to drive conversion proved quite successful. In our own doors, we're also continuing work on creating a more streamlined premium selling environment, one that allows us to better showcase the product and brand and ultimately provide a much more enjoyable consumer experience. Online, we're working to strengthen our mobile capability, upgrading consumer messaging and better leveraging affiliates and partners. Together, these initiatives are paying dividends. Consumers have responded very well with conversion up in all formats throughout the quarter. Overall, a great quarter and very pleased with the progress we're making.", "Now here's Karl Heinz to take you through Timberland's international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's revenue outside of the Americas were flat year-over-year, including a mid-teen increase in Asia, offset by a mid single-digit decline in Europe. In line with expectations, revenues for Timberland in Europe were down at the mid-single digit versus last year. In a still soft market, our D2C business was a bright spot, up at mid-teen rate. This was offset by a low double-digit decline in our wholesale business with continued particular weakness in Southern Europe, Timberland's largest market.", "Echoing Steve's comments, here, too, we are very encouraged by the progress we continue to make against our strategic initiatives. In fact, and though it's still early, we're happy to report that initial signs for fall footwear bookings are positive, a clear indicator that gives us great confidence that we are positioned right where we expect it to be.", "In footwear, we did see some bright spots in the quarter, including success in our transitional product offerings, Stormbuck assortment and in our classic collections for both men and women. We also saw positive results in our apparel business with specific strength in outerwear and pants.", "We did see a make [ph] in Timberland's 40th anniversary. Our marketing efforts are focused there on cash message [ph] and heritage. We also recently deployed a new email marketing system, which will allow us to target consumers on a more customized and relevant basis and gain key insight going forward.", "Asia's Timberland business continues to perform well and grew at mid-teens rate, both in wholesale and DTC, with positive results across all product categories. We opened one new retail door during the quarter, as well as one e-commerce site, both in China, and are making great strides connecting with consumers in the region.", "Now I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Wrangler.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. First quarter global revenues for Wrangler were down 2%. In our Americas business, revenues were about flat with increases in our Western Specialty and Latin American businesses, offset by a slight decline in sales to our U.S. mass channel. Recall that in the first quarter of 2012, we pulled forward seasonals due to a very early spring here in the U.S., which created exceptional growth in that period. We expect second quarter global revenues for Wrangler to increase at a mid-single-digit rate. Overall, the Wrangler business is in line with our expectations for the full year.", "In our mass channel, our jeans and Wrangler advanced comfort products continue to gain significant momentum. And our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut in our Western Specialty business is exceeding our expectations, really spot on with this very important and growing customer base.", "We're also hard at work with our key retail partners, enhancing our brand's in-store presentation. From mass to specialty, we have a number of initiatives geared at more meaningful ways to tell the Wrangler story, a story of innovation, authenticity and value.", "We're also seeing encouraging results and success with our expansion in the sporting goods, outdoor and regional mid-tier locations, all very important channels that allow us to really dial in the product, brand presentation and how we tell the Wrangler story to a broader range of consumers.", "Quarter-after-quarter, I seem to mention it and I will again here, too, Wrangler in Latin America posted strong results, fueled by growing brand awareness and great reception to our retail expansion, particularly in Argentina and Chile.", "And on the marketing front, we're excited to announce that we drafted New Orleans Saints quarterback, Drew Brees, to join the Wrangler team. Drew's dependability, work ethic, family values and personal generosity make him a natural fit for Wrangler. So stay tuned and look for a new campaign expected to launch sometime in August.", "And now, here's Karl Heinz with a few words on Europe.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "While our Wrangler business in Europe was down at a mid-single-digit rate, it was also in line with our expectations, and we are seeing some bright spots. Our innovation focus on denim performance and fit is paying off, and our new products are selling through well. As a result, we are experiencing strengths in the emerging markets, particularly Russia, and a few of our key accounts across Europe. Also, due to a continued focus on operating efficiencies, our profitability continues to improve.", "Now back to Scott with Lee.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. Revenues for the Lee brand on a global basis were down 6% in the quarter, which was about in line with expectations. And here, too, the comparison was pretty tough due to the seasonal's pull forward in last year's same period.", "In 2013, we continue to expect modest growth on a global basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, with particular strength in the second and third quarters as new introductions and seasonal product lead the way. Revenues for the Lee brand are expected to increase at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Given the ongoing challenges in the mid-tier channel, which, ultimately, we feel are short term in nature, we remain vigilant about creating new growth opportunities. Advanced fall bookings for new product, including Perfect Fit for women and Modern Series for men, are very encouraging and a clear indicator that our products are being well received.", "Another great example, one that you've heard me talk about on previous calls is our Lee Platinum Label collection. A few quarters ago, we started with a small test of this product with one of our key department store partners, and we're pleased to report that it has continued to gain sizable momentum. In fact, following strong consumer response, we're adding an additional 150 doors this year, which should bring the total to nearly 450 locations by year end, so a great case study of how innovative product and consumer connectivity can generate an excellent long-term growth opportunity.", "Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Lee's international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In Europe, during the first quarter, Lee brand revenues were down at a mid-single-digit rate. Here as well, we are beginning to experience some success with our new product innovation. During the quarter, we saw good sell-through of our new Stretch Deluxe women's product across most of our key accounts. And this quarter, we're launching a new collection for men called Blue Label.", "In our DTC business, although still quite small, we are encouraged by double-digit comp performance in our new retail format. We will continue to roll out this new format with additional owned and partner stores opening in 2013. This is on the heels of successful launches in 2012. Lee also benefited from improved operating efficiencies and is delivering stronger profitability. The business is on track with our full year expectations.", "In Asia, Lee continues to be impacted by efforts to rightsize channel inventory levels. As we stated on our fourth quarter call, Lee's performance in Asia will be particularly challenging in the first half with the expectation that the business begins to normalize in fourth quarter of this year.", "Even though sales were down, profitability exceeded expectations, driven by favorable product mix and lower product costs. We have seen solid results with the recent introduction of Urban Riders' eThink [ph] and Stretch Deluxe. So our new products are doing well, just tempered by current channel dynamics. Additionally, we are increasing the number of partner door locations, executing very focused marketing campaigns and expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities.", "Now I turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. Well, I'll wrap up today's call with some additional commentary around our first quarter results and our strengthened full year guidance.", "VF's total revenues were up 2%, which was in line with our expectations. Recall that back in February, we indicated that we expect to just modest growth in the first quarter due to tough comparisons against a very strong performance in last year's first quarter, in part due to some timing shifts in shipments. So we're tracking right on plan. And as a reminder, our revenue comparison was negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos in April of 2012.", "Gross margin, a key component of VF's long-term growth story, was right in line with our expectations, improving by 240 basis points to an all-time high of 48.1%. As discussed in the press release, we saw improvements across nearly all our businesses with the biggest improvement coming from our Jeanswear coalition, as well as the continued shift in our mix toward higher-margin businesses. For the full year, we remain very comfortable with maintaining our previous guidance for a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin.", "Our SG&A ratio, as a percent of revenues, rose 100 basis points to 34.4% in the first quarter. Half of that increase came from our growing D2C business and the other half is due to higher levels of marketing spending. This is a significant year of investment for us in direct to consumer with an all-time high number of new store openings planned. And as you know, most of the benefit from those new store openings will come in the second half of the year, when our direct-to-consumer business is strongest. And as previously indicated, we are increasing our marketing investments behind our brands, given the success we've had from those investments, supported by the work we've done to measure their returns.", "That said, we remain very disciplined about controlling costs and focusing investments across all our businesses and brands to ensure the right balance between growth and profitability. Despite these increased investments, because of top line leverage on a full year basis, we expect that our SG&A ratio will remain relatively flat for the year.", "In terms of operating margin, our strong gross margin performance helped drive a 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin to 13.8%. Here, too, we remain comfortable with maintaining our full year guidance of an increase in operating margin by nearly 100 basis points.", "And that brings us to the bottom line, where adjusted earnings per share, which excludes Timberland acquisition-related expenses of $0.02 per share in the quarter, grew by 25% to $2.43 from $1.94 per share last year. Earnings in the quarter, included a $0.12 per share discrete tax benefit, primarily related to the impact of U.S. tax law changes enacted in 2013, which were retroactive to 2012. Now many refer to this as the fiscal cliff impact. It's important to note that benefit was anticipated and built into our plans. On a GAAP basis, which, of course, also included the tax benefits, first quarter net income was $270 million with a 26% increase in earnings per share to $2.41.", "Now a few quick comments on our overall coalition results. First, Outdoor & Action Sports. We continue to be really pleased with our results here. Our brands are strong and growing, gaining share and expanding around the world, which should lead to another great year of record top and bottom line performance. Total Outdoor & Action Sports revenues were up 10% with solid growth across our top brands, including a high-teens increase in D2C and a nearly 10% increase in our international businesses. This coalition also continues to deliver outstanding profitability with a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin in the quarter to 16.4%.", "Jeanswear revenue growth took just a bit of a breather this quarter, but we did anticipate somewhat challenging comparisons. You recall that last year, Jeanswear posted exceptionally strong revenue growth in the first quarter, due to early shipments in the U.S. of spring seasonal products, the rollout of the Rock & Republic brand and a strong Asian jeans business. This year, the timing of shipment of those seasonal goods in the U.S. has returned to its normal cadence, and our jeans business in Asia was negatively impacted by channel inventory issues as we've previously discussed. But the real story in Jeanswear this quarter is around profitability with operating margin reaching 20%, including improvements in both the Wrangler and Lee brands across every region of the world. Congrats to our global Jeanswear teams for delivering this extraordinary performance.", "And turning now to Imagewear, where revenues declined 9% versus last year. This, too, was pretty much right in line with our expectations, given very tough comps in our image business, where revenues increased over 20% in last year's first quarter, helped by some catch-up in shipments of strong orders in oil and gas. Impacting this quarter's results was the timing of a program renewal, which is expected later this year.", "In terms of our Licensed Sports business, revenues were flat year-over-year. We're looking forward to stronger top line results in our Imagewear coalition in the second half of the year based on a strong pipeline of new product initiatives in both the image and Licensed Sports sides of the business. In terms of profitability, you likely noted the decline in operating margins cited in the press release, which is due primarily to reduced sales volumes.", "Sportswear revenues were up 4% in the quarter with growth tempered by a shift in the timing of Nautica wholesale shipments from the first to the second quarter. On the D2C side, Sportswear achieved growth of more than 20%, reflecting healthy double-digit gains in both Nautica and Kipling's D2C businesses. Our Sportswear business is headed toward a great year, and we expect second quarter revenues to grow by a mid-teen percent.", "Since the Sportswear and Contemporary businesses were not yet covered on this call, I'll provide a little bit more cover -- color around these 2 businesses. Nautica achieved modest revenue growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from its focus on performance benefits, easy care, wrinkle free and moisture-wicking now built into nearly half of its product line. With its men's Sportswear business delivering consistently solid performance, Nautica is expanding its presence on the women's side. Building off solid results, both online and in its outlet stores, Nautica is testing a new women's Sportswear line in department stores. We're really excited about the potential of this future growth for the Nautica brand.", "And a quick word on Kipling. The brand continues its run of double-digit growth in the U.S., led by its innovative crinkled metallic nylon bags and in backpacks, accessories and totes. The steady improvement in Sportswear profitability we saw throughout 2012 continues with operating margin up 14% in the quarter and an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. So all in all, a good start to the year and a great year ahead for our Sportswear group.", "And finally, Contemporary Brands. Keep in mind that the comparisons here are impacted by the sale of the John Varvatos business, which occurred in April of 2012. If you take Varvatos out of the -- out of 2012, revenues were down 4% in the quarter with an increase in D2C revenues, offset by a decrease in wholesale sales. Contemporary business in premium department stores appears to have softened a bit in the first quarter, a trend we see continuing in the second quarter. But with strong and well-received product collections for the fall, we expect the business to get back on track in the second half of the year.", "And of course, no VF earnings call would be complete without a couple of comments on 2 primary growth drivers, international and direct to consumer. Total international revenues were up 6% in the quarter with growth in all 3 regions, Europe, Asia and the Americas. The growth was well balanced between D2C and wholesale. Within international's developing D2C businesses, revenue growth was at a high teen percentage. Our first quarter international results were also right in line with our expectations.", "And taking a look at our direct-to-consumer results on a global basis, first quarter revenues were up 12%, or 14% excluding the impact from the Varvatos exit. With double-digit increases across nearly all of our Outdoor & Action Sports brands, Nautica and Splendid and Ella Moss, it's clear that the investments we continue to make in our D2C businesses are really paying off. Direct to consumer is a big part of our immediate and long-term growth plans. In its first quarter, we're right on track with both our growth expectations and profitability improvements.", "And ending with a couple of balance sheet and cash flow highlights, we continue to be incredibly proud of the rigorous discipline around managing our inventories, which were down 7% year-over-year. Also, during the quarter, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares for approximately $280 million and contributed $100 million to VF's pension plan, which is now nearly fully funded.", "Turning to the remainder of the year, let's revisit our full year outlook. We continue to expect 6% revenue growth to approximately $11.5 billion. And with a great first quarter behind us, adjusted earnings per share are now expected to rise to $10.75 with a $0.05 increase over our prior guidance of $10.70 and representing a 12% increase over 2012 levels. As noted in our press release, it's important to remember that last year's second quarter adjusted earnings per share results of $1.11 included a $0.10 per share discrete tax benefit, primarily related to the settlement of the prior year's tax audits.", "And there were 2 additional items that were excluded from adjusted earnings per share due to their unusual nature, but obviously included in the $1.40 per share reported on a GAAP basis. They were a $0.32 per share benefit related to the sale of John Varvatos and $0.03 per share of acquisition expenses related to Timberland.", "Now taking look at the revenue case for the remainder of the year. We expect second and third quarter revenue growth to be more consistent with our full year growth expectation and the fourth quarter to see the strongest comparison of the year, driven by the growing contribution and expansion of our direct-to-consumer business.", "Also, one last item. Our assumed euro-to-dollar rate remains unchanged at $1.30. At this rate, the impact of a $0.05 move in the euro against the dollar would be about $60 million in revenues and $0.10 in EPS.", "So to wrap it up, we're off to a great start for the year across nearly all key measures, we're right on track with where we plan to be. With the strongest brand portfolio in our industry improving profitability with a clear path to continued margin expansion and a balance sheet that is strong and flexible, we look forward to another year of strong growth. In fact, the VF story is better than ever, and we're really looking forward to sharing our new 5-year plan with you at our Investor Day in June.", "We hope all of you can join us. And with that, we've concluded our prepared remarks, so I'll hand it back to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. No real additional comments. We're thrilled with our start to the year, confident in our outlook and ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Bob, I was wondering if you could help us understand, your inventories look like they're in very good shape on the balance sheet, but regionally, can you walk us through what the inventories are like in Europe and China at this point in time?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. Actually, Kate, we're in good shape across-the-board. As you know, we've -- this is an area we put a lot of focus, and that focus has been placed on our global inventory levels. The calls that we've referenced in the past, we have -- we do those calls on a global basis and touch base with the -- our leaders around the globe. So our inventories right now across our businesses, across our brands and across our geographies are really in pretty good -- are in good shape.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second question is I'm just wondering if you could talk through your backlog into the back half of the year, now that you have an increased visibility into that. Was the backlog better or worse than you expected when you last spoke to us in February? And is there still possibility for The North Face to get more orders at this point in time for winter?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Kate, this is Steve. I'll take this question since you seem to have The North Face in the middle of it. It's -- we've come through the fall booking season, and we mentioned the caution that's in the retail community. And this year's booking sequence is a little bit longer. There's longer tail to this than we've seen historically. So it's a little early for us to cite actual numbers. But I can tell you that the orders that we're taking in are very much in line with our expectations, in our high single-digit guidance that we gave in our year-end call.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul from Barclays.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Guys, I got 2 questions. The first one is on Timberland. Timberland Europe, are there any plans to rationalize the Southern Europe exposure? And what could be the inflection point in the European business there?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Bob, this is Karl Heinz here. As you know, Southern Europe is this -- the largest market for Timberland in Europe, particularly Italy. And we all know Italy at the moment is a tough spot to sell any kind of goods. We have 2 kinds of channels where we work with Timberland. One is the wholesale channel, which clearly suffered, especially in Southern Europe, as we said in the press release. The other one is DTC, which has 2 components, one is owned stores and the other one, which has -- Timberland has a great presence, is partnership stores. Now even in a challenged market like Italy, where we have 150 stores, we have seen last year, actually, positive comps on our owned -- on partnership stores and the same for Q1. So we just won also an award in the U.K. for the hottest footwear company, which we're pretty confident that, clearly, we're not immune from what is happening in the market. But the fact that in our own stores the comps are good shows that the brand is strong.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then the -- my second question is around the mid-tier channel for you guys, maybe Eric or, I don't know, Steve. But the denim business in the mid-tier and the outlook there in some of the other brands you have in the mid-tier, can you just help us understand how you have that estimated and forecasted for the rest of the year right now?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Bob, it's Eric. I'll take a shot at that since it's across VF -- our 3 biggest businesses in the mid-tier are Lee Jeans business, our Vans business and our Licensed Sports business, and there's really no change in our outlook from where we started the year. The channel has been a little difficult for a host of reasons that have been well documented in the press. And the interesting thing is, actually, there may be -- it may get a little bit better for us than we're currently thinking. And the reason I'm saying that is around the Lee business. JCPenney is indicating that they're going to try to attract their traditional shopper, and that traditional shopper was a good Lee customer. And to the extent they're successful at getting that traffic back in the door, we're very confident that the Lee brand has the right products and value equation to get more business. The Vans business in the channel has actually done pretty well at JCPenney, in particular, who decided to use Vans as an action point to connect with youth consumers. Our Vans business is actually up. So we're pretty confident about that. And the Licensed Sports business is so much a factor of which teams are playing and who's winning, and there's no change in that. Did that get to that heart of your question?", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, definitely.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti from UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First off, maybe Bob, I -- can you talk a little bit more about the gross margins for the year, maybe look at the cadence over the next few quarters to help us with our models? And also, can you talk about -- and maybe how much of the improvement in the quarter was from things like product costs versus longer-term drivers?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, Michael. So the cadence of gross margin, as you might expect, the second quarter -- actually, each quarter will show nice improvement on our gross margins. In the second quarter, the improvement will be less than it was in the first quarter. And then the third and fourth quarters, it'll be a little less than it was in the second quarter. The bigger improvements, as you said -- what drove the first quarter improvement, really consistently seeing that 60 to 70 basis points from mix. So in the first quarter of the 240 basis points, about 70 was related to mix and the remainder was related to primarily product costs. Yes, in the first quarter, a significant portion of that was related to Jeanswear. And that'll continue, not as strongly but will continue into the second quarter as well. So -- but I'd repeat one of the things that -- one of the comments that I made in my commentary is that we expect to see gross margin expansion in across-the-board in nearly every one of our businesses on a full year basis. And actually, we saw that in the first quarter. So we're seeing improvement across-the-board, but Jeanswear clearly led the way in the first quarter.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So -- and then if I could just follow-up a little bit, maybe a little bit more color on Timberland. I think -- obviously, that's been in the spotlight as you guys look to try and accelerate that, and I think that -- especially the direct to consumer coming in at high teens was a pretty unexpected number and fairly good. It seems fairly good, particularly given unit growth might still be sluggish. Can you just talk about the brand a little bit and what's going right now? We've -- you guys have talked a lot about how apparel will be launched in the second half or what -- maybe some of the other things you're doing right now and maybe look ahead to the apparel in the second half. And then maybe also just talk about the operational initiatives. You mentioned that you're working on the D2C doors there.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Okay, Michael. This is Steve. Karl Heinz and I'll split this. I'll cover the Americas piece and toss the ball to Karl Heinz for the international piece. So as I mentioned, we're really encouraged with our Timberland business. Over 14, 15 months ago, we began to wrap our arms around this, begin to work diligently on a lot of the integration initiatives, which focused mostly on operational improvements and improving product and getting clarity around what the brand stands for. And what you see coming into 2013 is really that paying off across both our wholesale and D2C channels. Our product pipeline, as I mentioned, the heritage product, as well as the new products, are resonating very nicely across all channels. Our marketing message is very clear, and you can see that in how consumers are responding in our online environment. And we're very -- looking forward to the launch of our new campaign this fall. Now the operational comments that I made around D2C, we have a new leader within our D2C channel, and that leadership team really bore down on the key performance indicators across the retail channel. And we focused very hard on that retail environment, first and foremost, improving the clarity of this -- of the in-store, narrowing down the assortments and focusing, first and foremost, on servicing consumers and conversion. And we've seen that really pay off nicely and are very confident with how that will lead us on through the balance of the year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Michael, moving to Asia, first. In Asia, we continue to do well with Timberland. As I mentioned in the script, we are up both in DTC and in wholesale. We have great presence in Japan, in Malaysia. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, we have subsidiary. And also the brand is now embedded in our headquarter in Hong Kong with our branch. So they will particularly benefit for our know-how we have in China with Timberland. As we mentioned, it's a little bit -- we -- I mean, we're just starting with China. So that is, for sure, a great opportunity. Europe, I touched before. I think what is pleasing -- I always say we're not immune from what is going on in Europe. And we all know what the situation is. But we do see great results, especially in our DTC, which is an indicator that the brand is healthy. We were up mid-teens, which is very strong in Q1, which gives us confidence. And also, as I mentioned, the future -- the fall orders are coming in, actually, a little bit better than we expected. So all in all, Timberland, I guess, we are pleased with this brand.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "My first question is actually surrounding the denim business in Asia. I mean, understanding the inventory overages just in the channel there, has there been any change in terms of how you're thinking about the potential stabilization there in the second half? And how should we, in this context, think about China and the growth there as we progress throughout the balance of the year this year? That's my first part.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Erinn, Karl Heinz here. Obviously, again, Lee has been one of our strongest performers in the last years in China, and we don't change that in the midterm. It has been strong growth, very profitable. As we said, there is a short-term issue, this overhang in inventory in the channel, which, by the way, is only related to jeans. We don't see that in all our other brands, and they're all doing nicely as we saw. You heard the numbers on The North Face. So long term, we're absolutely confident that we go back where we have been. As we mentioned, by the end of the year, we plan -- we expect this to stabilize.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful, Karl Heinz. And then just -- I guess a second question for you, following up on the European kind of macro situation. I mean, how are you seeing -- or have you seen any kind of change in consumer trends in terms of shopping patterns or even -- either channel preference? Maybe it is a little bit of distortion towards the DTC, just given the sustained weakness there. And then I guess, secondly, if you could call out -- I mean, clearly, Southern Europe is already very weak, and you've called that out, as many companies have. But any other markets that either over-indexed or under-indexed relative to your average trend in Europe? That could be helpful to kind of frame up the context there.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. So the good news is we have a diversified portfolio of brands, which help us -- and the second good point is we are not overexposed in one area. We do -- we are pretty diversified in many countries in Europe, especially in the big 5 -- in the 5 countries and also in the emerging markets. So again, we see some softness, for sure, in the -- in southern hemisphere, in Spain and Italy. And Spain just announced numbers yesterday, so they're not really encouraging. But the good news is, again, because we have this diversified portfolio of brands, and you see the results, we still continue to deliver on brands are really stellar. We don't expect Europe to change significantly in the future. We don't expect it to get worse and probably not get better. But again, we're pretty confident. On the DTC side, we said that it's a great opportunity for us going forward. We don't have the size of the D2C business we have here in North America, and we are building it up. We're investing in people, talents. We're actually accelerating now the opening of stores. So overall, our plans for Europe, while this year, a little bit softer, but we reconfirm what we have said, which is mid-single digit up. But longer term, we plan to go back to the usual growth which we had in the past.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Erinn, it's Eric. I'll add just a little bit of color to that, because it gets -- let me speak about VF's model, which we think is so important to our consistent success. If you look at our big 3 brands in Europe, Timberland, Vans and The North Face, The North Face and Vans are primarily built out in Northern Europe, and we're doing exceptionally well. Timberland is primarily -- was -- the biggest market is Italy. But it's that portfolio that lets us get through -- a year like 2012, I think we were up 10% in Europe. All the other heads are nodding. That's the right number. And we're looking at high single digits for this year. And it really is because we're able to say, \"All right, if we can't affect the economy in Italy, and we can't, what we can do is increase the investment in our Northern European brands, where the economies are stronger.\" And that's exactly what we're doing. And that's why Vans has had so much success in Northern Europe is we've just chosen to invest more there because that we can take action on. While we respond prudently where -- there are more challenges in Southern Europe, and that's how we work our models. So thank you for letting me make that statement.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Just a final point. We never talked about the other brands. Clearly, the top 3 brands are the major drivers. But this year's -- we saw in Q1, and particularly in the full year, on our other brands, like SmartWool, Napapijri, Kipling, Eastpak, we all expect them to grow in Europe this year, which is positive news.", "Operator", "Moving on to your next question from Omar Saad from ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up -- I know the DTC mix has been one of the drivers on the gross margin side. Could you kind of remind us where you are in terms of DTC penetration, what percentage of the business it is overall, where it was a few years ago, and how high you think it can go over time? Cannibalization with the wholesale channel, is that something you think about? And then how does online fit into your kind of long-range thinking about the direct channel?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I'll start with that, to respond to the first point in terms of the penetration that we have. We're -- in a few years, it wasn't all that long ago that our percentage was really quite low in direct to consumer. So it's expanded very, very nicely over the past number of years. In 2012, D2C was represented 21% of our total business in 2013. We expect D2C to be 23% of our business, and we're excited about laying out our plans for the future over the next 5 years. But it's safe to say that we do expect to continue to see direct to consumer expanding as a percent of our total business.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And online, cannibalization with wholesale, is there any channel conflict there? Has that been an issue at all? And then online, how it fits in?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. Omar, Eric here. The -- we try very hard to use this as a supportive strategy for our brands and to avoid cannibalization. And we actually work with our wholesale partners to where -- they know where we're going to put store. A great example of this is Vans, which in the last 2 or 3 years, has put up a lot of stores around New York City, around Boston, now around Philadelphia, where we didn't have substantial distribution. And we just didn't have the doors there that let the brand speak to the customers. So we're putting the doors there. And that's true in markets in Europe and in Germany. It's true in the U.K. That's how we look at it. And we have so much runway, because we ended last year with roughly 1,100 doors across all of our brands across the world. So we're so relatively undeveloped that we still see lots of runway before the cannibalization thing comes into play. The e-commerce thing is a tricky thing. Because we don't know if that's -- we can't really say where those customers are coming from, whether they're new customers to the brand, whether they used to shop in our stores or somebody else's stores. What we do know is we have to create a compelling way for our consumers to engage with our brands from their phones, from whatever devices they have, and we have to let them shop while they're there. And that's a rapidly growing piece of our business and a rapidly growing piece of the consumer experience, not just in the U.S., but also in Europe, where I think last year, we put new websites up in 7 countries.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Is that correct? In 7 countries last year. So we're beginning to do that there. And I don't know how to discuss the cannibalization of that because we know it's the right thing to do. And if it elevates the brand experience, which we think it does, it should be good for everybody.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Omar, I guess I'd just add to that is all of that, of course, is supported by a very strong profitability in our direct-to-consumer businesses and really high returns on the investments that we make. It's what gives us the permission and the reasons that we continue to invest heavily.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "The last bit of color I'll add to that, because it get to some of Karl Heinz's observations about the strength of our DTC business in Europe, where our wholesale business is not so great in some markets. I do think that there, we're putting up our best -- when we open a store, we're all in. And we put a -- bring the brand to life the best way we know how, with strong inventory across all the styles. And some of our wholesale customers' aren't able or willing to do that now in this environment, and our willingness to do that, I think, is helping us. And it shows that when you put the whole brand out there in all its glory in a retail environment, people are still shopping.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Lindsay Dunkermann [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "Just -- I was hoping you could -- as we look at the MG&A line, can you tell us the increase, the split between sort of brand investment, DTC spending and then mix or other corporate items? So in other words, how much of the increase is a function of your investment in direct versus your investment in brand-building stuff?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes. Bob would be happy to take that question.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Right. So in the first quarter, there's a 100 basis point increase in our SG&A, and it was evenly split. At the beginning of the year, on our initial guidance, we indicated that from a marketing standpoint that we were going to up our spend this year. Right now, we're continuing to plan and -- on an increase of more than $60 million in the marketing side and about double the rate of our revenue increase. As I said in my comments, the reason we're willing to do that is because we absolutely believe with a lot of confidence, we're getting a great payback on those investments. And we support that with some science behind that in terms of measuring results. And yes, the other side is related to the heavier pay -- or the heavier investments in the direct-to-consumer side as well, the high number of new store openings. So in that first quarter, it was exactly half and half, 100 basis point increase.", "Unknown Analyst", "On the direct-to-consumer piece, you talked about investments upfront in the year and then generating greater returns on that in the back half. Can you just remind us sort of by concept where your increases in square footage are and where you expect to see the most improvement?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. The -- what I can say is this is that, clearly, where we're reinvesting in opening new stores in high number of new stores is absolutely aligned with where we have our strongest returns. A high percentage of the new store openings is in the Vans, within the Vans brand around the globe, not just in the U.S. but in Europe as well. And then, of course, The North Face and Timberland really round out the top 3. That's where the investments are going.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes. And that's split slightly more than half in the U.S. and slightly less than half internationally. So it's a global strategy.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Have you given us actual store count?", "Robert K. Shearer", "We did. We said that we'd open about 160 new stores this year.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then if you can comment at a high level how you guys think about the deal environment out there, the M&A opportunity, what the pipeline might look at -- might look like and how you think of as far as -- where multiples are today relative to where you'd like them to be?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. We're still actively looking. I don't normally respond this way, but I just don't know that the environment is a lot different than what it's been. A lot of the deals that we've made have resulted from long-standing relationships and -- that, again, have been built over a period of time. So it's the same approach that we use today, and we're still looking. In terms of multiples, the same kind of thing. The multiples don't -- from what we see and what we're willing to pay, it really don't vary a lot unless a business is really in a trough. Then we might have to pay a little more, right, in terms of the multiples. But it just doesn't -- from our viewpoint, it just doesn't change a lot over time. Good brands are still treasured possessions, and to get the right brands requires the right kind of investment.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mitch Kummetz from Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Two questions. Let me start with Bob. I'm trying to gauge how conservative your gross margin guidance is on the year? You're saying up 100 basis points. It sounds like you're expecting mix to be about 60 to 70 basis points of that. Just in the first quarter, the benefit that you got from lower input costs, I think puts you in the black, 30 to 40 basis points even on a year. So -- I mean, what are the other puts and takes here that gets you to kind of your guidance on the year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. So what happens, Mitch, of course, as the year goes on, as the year goes on, we won't see the same benefit that we saw from Jeanswear in the first quarter. Obviously, all this is about what we're comping against in the earlier part of last year. And in 2012, in the first quarter of 2012, we brought in very, very high denim cost, right. So we were comping against that. That's why the big improvement. In the second quarter, you remember the sequencing last year, as we looked at, the improvements started to come as costs came down in the Jeanswear business. So in the second quarter, we're matched up against costs, which weren't quite as high as they were in the first quarter. So as I said earlier, the -- on the improvement in gross margin, the second quarter will clearly be less than it was in the first quarter. And then in the latter part of the year, the cost from a cost standpoint is more normalized at that point in time. We just -- we don't have the same kind of impact from the Jeanswear side. We're also -- I mean, we're seeing some benefit, even in Imagewear, for example. Our costs there were higher last year, and they've come down some. But in the second half of the year, again, a much more normalized situation relative to product costs. But what we have is we continue to have that mix impact that we've -- we very consistently talk about and you just mentioned, will help us in the second half of the year. So that's really the way to think about it, a little bit bigger product cost impacts in the early part of the year and then that continuation of our mix benefit coming in the latter part of the year. And sure, we're always going to be a little bit cautious relative to the guidance.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So there's -- so there aren't any real puts and takes of significance, other than the costs and the mix as we think about the year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, those are the 2 bigger factors. What we're also seeing is some benefit, but it's just not at the same magnitude. From efficiencies that we see, controlling the inventories, when we reduce our inventories by over $100 million like we did in the first quarter, it just creates less exposure related to inventories. So there are some efficiency gains. As I said, we expect to see gross margin improvement in every single business on an annual basis, and that's not driven by product costs. It's just driven by controlling inventories and having great product and be able to get -- to earn the margins. So yes, there are some other factors. But yes, those are the big pieces.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And the second question I had is I'm just curious, with the slow start that we've had this spring, I mean, you guys talked about the impact that, that had on Q1, some benefits, some negatives, but what's the impact that has on Q2? Do we lose kind of -- I mean, how significant is your at-once business in Q2? And do you lose -- or do you think you lose out on any business there versus a year ago, given the slow start to spring? And any maybe backup of in-season inventory at retail right now?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Let me take a shot at part of that. Last year, we shipped some of our spring merchandise in the first quarter because it was a warmer year. So this year, that's going to be a second quarter shipment for pieces of our business, compounded by the fact that it's been a cooler-than-normal quarter for us so far. So we were shipping the goods this quarter, but right now, they're not selling. How that's going to play out, my guess is summer will come. It will get warm and that stuff will sell. The question will be, does -- do the -- does the summer get here in time that they sell at full price? And that, I don't know the answer to. All-in, I think we're going to get through that period just fine. Does anybody else even want to enhance that comment at all?", "Scott H. Baxter", "I think it -- this is Scott. I think it equalizes itself out. I feel really good about the spring. I think it's a compelling offer that we have. We have a nice assortment out there. And summer will come. It's just a little bit about 6-week differential from last year. You saw the weather changed about 6 weeks early last year. It's about 6 weeks later this year. But if you go back to '11, you go back to '10, it's back to a normal pattern this year, maybe a week or 2 cooler, but I feel confident going forward.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Mitch, this is Steve. From an Outdoor & Action Sports position here in the Americas, the season is actually lining up consistent with how our goods flow. Our biggest spring business in the first quarter would be Reef, and Reef had a very good quarter, follow that with Vans. And the results that we posted for Vans were extremely strong. And in The North Face, that we saw very good sell-through of our winter-weight goods. We typically sell quite a bit of spring rainwear in the first quarter, which then leads us into the Sportswear sets in the second quarter. That's when equipment has shifted to opening up. And all of that really is lining up nicely to deliver against our plans.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our final question from Christian Buss from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes. I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on the new channels of distribution you've opened up over the last year or so for Vans, and what you've seen there, what successes you've had. And if you could talk a little bit about the LXVI product, that would be helpful as well.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. Chris, this is Steve. So really, the only new channel we've opened up over the last 12 months was moving into Foot Locker with the LXVI collection. Otherwise, Vans stays very, very committed to the disciplined product take -- product segmentation strategy across a very clear set of channels. Our LXVI collection has done very well with Foot Locker. They remain very confident as do we in the growth potential of that particular line extension. As we access the consumer that's adjacent to our core Action Sports consumer in the athletic space, so very positive and continue to see growth and commitment from where we've extended.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes. Thank you, all, for your time and attention this morning. We do have an event coming up between now and our second quarter earnings release on June 11 in New York City, where we're going to be laying out our 5-year growth plans. And we're looking forward to that meeting. I hope you are as well, and we hope to see you there. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "That will conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Director of IR. You may begin.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss VF's second quarter 2013 results.", "Before we begin today, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements under the definition of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.", "Additionally, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website at vfc.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our Group Presidents, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.", "Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. At our Investor Day last month, where we outlined our new 5-year growth plan, I made the comment that we believe we're really just beginning to achieve the potential that we have to grow and deliver shareholder value. Based on today's strong results, I can say with great confidence that our ability to drive growth and long-term sustainable profit is right on track. And at the halfway mark of 2013, we're also right on track with our expectations for the first year of that 5-year plan. We are on track for 6% revenue growth to $11.5 billion; on track to deliver a significant improvement in full year gross and operating margin; on track to deliver 13% earnings per share growth, consistent with our long-term target; and on track to deliver very solid cash flow generation, with more than $1.4 billion expected this year.", "In the second quarter, we grew revenues by 4% to $2.2 billion, and we remain very comfortable holding to our full year guidance. With positive results across both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels and low single-digit increases in our U.S. and European businesses, coupled with greater than 10% growth in both our Asia Pacific and our non-U.S. Americas region, we're pleased with our balanced performance. Gross margin for the quarter hit 48.5%, an all-time VF record for any quarter, driven by lower product costs and mix. That's an improvement of 240 basis points over last year's second quarter, a result we're truly proud of, and certainly, a higher bar is now set for the future. With improvements in nearly every coalition, our adjusted operating margin also showed significant improvement, up 140 basis points despite a heavier investment in advertising and our direct-to-consumer business on a year-over-year basis. And finally, all of this translates to second quarter adjusted earnings per share being up 14% to $1.27.", "Looking at the balance of the year, while the economic environment remains a bit uncertain and a bit of a headwind, we're confident that our powerful brands and powerful platforms are among the best positioned in the industry to deliver fantastic products to consumers and strong profits to our shareholders. In fact, based on strong first half results, with margins and EPS exceeding our original plan, we're raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to $10.85. This is a 13% increase over 2012, which is directly in line with the 5-year plan we just announced last month. And we now expect our gross margin to improve slightly more than 100 basis points for the full year.", "The consistent improvement in our gross margin over the past few years has allowed us to make meaningful investments in our brands, products and our innovation strategy that have proven very effective in building our business around the world. This year, we've taken our full year guidance from $10.70 to $10.85, demonstrating, once again, strong improvement in gross margin.", "If we were to see further gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, we would likely invest those dollars against new marketing and product initiatives to support our 5-year growth commitment to our shareholders. This is a strategic balance that you come to know and expect from us and one that's proven effective many times in the past.", "So a great first half. We're on track across nearly all key measures. We're improving profitability and, by all accounts, well on our way to another record year.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott, who'll take us through VF's top 5 brands. And then Bob will close out with a deeper look at our financials. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thank you, Eric. Second quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 5%, fueled by moderate growth in the wholesale sales, a 15% increase in the brand's D2C business and a more than 20% increase in international sales.", "In the Americas region, revenues were down slightly, with a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale business, which was expected given seasonal lower demand and coupled with retailer caution. Our D2C performance in the quarter was ahead of expectations, growing at a mid-teen rate, a result that creates great momentum that we expect to carry into the balance of the year. Recent investments in our frequent shopper and loyalty program are really paying off. And overall, we were encouraged by the strong sell-through of fleece, rainwear and other spring items, including color updates on key styles.", "Now let's review our progress against the key growth drivers for The North Face brand in 2013: product innovation, marketing and D2C. First, product. This fall, The North Face is bringing consumers breakthrough innovations, including Thermoball, a proprietary, athlete-tested, synthetic insulation technology that is lightweight and compressible like down but continues to insulate even when wet. Equivalent to 600 fill down, Thermoball was reviewed last week by Climbing Magazine, who dubbed it handmade down, noting that testers immediately thought it was down. Thermoball will be featured in over 5,000 stores in North America this fall.", "Also new for fall 2013 for our snowsports category is our new Steep Series, a line of big mountain outerwear designed with and for the next-generation of riders who are rising -- or raising the bar on what's possible in the biggest and harshest terrain.", "And finally, the evolution of Flash Dry continues as the ultrafast drying standard for moisture moving technology expands even deeper into our product line. In less than 1 year, 3/4 of our accounts now carry Flash Dry.", "All right, let's move to marketing. Launching in the fourth quarter, our new Never Stop Exploring campaign will amplify connections with existing consumers and forge fresh relationships with new ones. And as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing great returns in our D2C business from our investments in our loyalty program. The North Face VIP program, which combines web and store transactions to accumulate points toward future transactions, is now active in all full-price stores and continues to see very healthy customer sign-up rates. So we're definitely pleased with our progress during the first half of the year in the Americas.", "And now here's Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks, Steven. Good morning, everyone. Outside the Americas, The North Face brand grew more than 20%, which is strength in both the D2C and wholesale businesses. In Europe, The North Face grew 10%, driven by balanced strength in both our D2C business and the wholesale channel. We also continue to see very strong results in our e-commerce business, with more than 60% growth in online sales as the brand continues to gain significant traction with and connection to consumers.", "Europe is a very large and well-developed outdoor sports market, and The North Face is the best positioned brand in the market to realize consistent, sustainable growth. Hereto, our new products are being received very positively. For example, we saw incredible response to our new Summit Series Verto Micro Hoodie, which is sold out in both the D2C and wholesale channels. We're also continuing to see great response from and opportunities to expand to European-specific products positioned to best meet the regionally specific needs and preferences.", "The North Face in Asia Pacific also had a strong second quarter, with revenues up more than 40%, driven primarily by outstanding growth in China. As I've mentioned before, we are focused on building brand awareness and engaging consumers in the outdoor market. And to support this effort, this fall, we will be launching a North Face TV campaign in China. We are excited to connect this way with consumers.", "Additionally, membership for kisheba.com [ph], our website providing an interactive social hub, connecting consumers with outdoor clubs, activities and the ability to purchase North Face products, has grown to 300,000 people. In June, we launched a kisheba [ph] mobile app, allowing members to connect to the online community, browse products and photos and locate a store, all from their mobile phone. We have seen great response to the app so far, with 690,000 downloads in the first 6 weeks.", "So our retail experience is improving. Consumers are joining us to explore the outdoors. And most importantly, we continue to deliver the products and experiences the consumer want. We remain confident in the remainder of 2013. And speaking of the rest of the year, Steve, you wanted to make a few comments about revenue cadence?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Looking towards the balance of the year, we continue to expect The North Face to achieve high single-digit revenue growth globally in 2013. However, the shape of that revenue in the Americas business will look a little bit different than years past. This is due to 2 reasons: first, as we've discussed throughout the year, retailers have remained cautious about fall orders, which has caused those orders to be pushed later into the year. Specifically, there will be a meaningful shift in North Face revenue that would've normally fall in the third quarter that will now occur in the fourth quarter. Second and separately, our wholesale partners' monthly calendars have shifted out 1 week, which pushes orders that are historically shipped in our fiscal September into our fiscal October. This is an issue specific to 2013 for The North Face Americas.", "So based on these 2 reasons, later orders and a September with 1 less week this year. Due to fiscal alignments, we're expecting third quarter global revenues for The North Face to be up at a low single-digit rate over last year and a low double-digit increase in the fourth quarter. We're on track for high single-digit global revenue growth for the full year.", "Now onto Vans. Global revenue for Vans in the second quarter was up a healthy 15%, with balanced mid-teen wholesale and D2C growth. During the quarter, momentum continued in the Americas region, where we saw balanced growth across our D2C and wholesale channels. We saw strength during the quarter from both the footwear and apparel categories.", "On the footwear side, we continue to perform very well. Our LXVI product has really shown customers what Vans can do in terms of innovation. And we've taken some of the key innovations from the LXVI line, particularly the RapidWeld stitch-less construction and the UltraCush footbed lining technology, and incorporated them in key styles across our classics and Pro Skate footwear collections. Additionally, our new DURACAP underlays added tremendous amount of durability. Combined, these innovations create the next Off the Wall evolution of skate footwear, engineered for comfort and wear and tear while maintaining excellent board feel.", "In terms of apparel, we are leveraging our VF supply chain to improve speed to market while continuing to evolve our products to be more relevant for the environments and seasons they're used in. By taking classic action sports products, the consumers are already connected to and adding performance benefits to them, such as weatherization, we're equipping the Vans consumer with a whole new level of quality and technology in both warm and cold weather. This allows us to have more relevant, year-round offerings as we extend our reach into cold-weather months and cold-weather markets.", "And speaking of new markets, I want to mention that our focus on geographic expansion continues to be a success. Our unique process of partnering with key players in each region ensures authentic brand building and establishes credibility in each new market we enter. This year, in our Americas business, we are focused on expanding the Vans business in the Boston and Atlanta markets of East Coast, as well as Canada and Mexico, where we have seen strong acceptance by those consumers. We're very happy with the progress we're making there.", "We also continue to engage consumers in unique ways to further their connection with the brand. The Vans U.S. Open of Surfing, which starts tomorrow in Huntington Beach, is an iconic event and the largest surf contest of its kind in the United States. With this, our inaugural event, we've put together a great cultural experience in action sports, music, art and fashion that we're excited to share, not only with those in attendance but with millions of fans across the globe through live webcasts, photos and videos at Vans' usopenofsurfing.com. We're incredibly excited to bring the Vans Off the Wall culture to the epicenter of surf.", "Great results in the first half, and we're very excited to get into the second part of the year. Now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some international highlights.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Outside the Americas, Vans second quarter revenues were up more than 20%. D2C growth was north of 40%, and we also saw very strong growth in wholesale. Vans continued its outstanding momentum in Europe, with revenues up 20%. The strong growth gives us great confidence that we'll deliver another year of impressive results.", "We recently launched an inspirational collaboration with Kenzo, a premier retail fashion brand. This collaboration allows us to bring regionally relevant products to European consumers while also driving regional awareness of the brand.", "On the D2C front, we opened new stores in Cologne, Edinburgh and Bluewater in London and completed a major retrofit of our West Ridge [ph] store in London, to showcase our new Vans retail concept.", "Vans Asia Pacific business also posted strong results in the second quarter, growing more than 20%. Here we launched Asia Art Tees, a program that supports local artists, where we bring their designs to life on T-shirts. We have also continued to see our regional and local product collaborations drive both brand awareness and sell-throughs. Both of these programs are part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that the brand remains relevant in the region and inspirational to the youth culture there. We also are using special events to drive consumer interest and lead the conversation of youth culture. During the quarter, the House of Vans experience at the Beijing Midi Music drew over 50,000 attendees.", "So great first half for Vans around the world and much more to come in the second half of this year. With that, let's move on to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Global revenues for Timberland were down 3% in the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We remain sharply focused on the strategic initiatives we have put in place to create a platform for long-term growth in both the D2C and wholesale channels. Our expectations for full year revenue growth remain unchanged in the mid-single-digit constant dollar range.", "In the Americas, revenues were up in the low single digits, driven by a high single-digit increase in D2C, partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale results. These results, too, were essentially in line with the expectations and really driven by ongoing strategic enhancements to optimize our distribution in both the D2C and wholesale channels.", "Turning to product. Both core and new programs continued to perform well. And while we will continue to capitalize on the iconic status of the yellow boot, we are also focused on delivering new innovative products. Our efforts to increase year-round relevance is paying off. In fact, the Hookset Handcrafted collection of casual, low-profile footwear, which is a central part of our year-round strategy, performed exceptionally well at both retail and wholesale. The Hookset collection was also the focus of our advertising campaigns during the quarter, and we are very pleased with the returns on the investments we've made there.", "A partnership with GQ Magazine, along with several new digital media partnerships with key influencers, are generating even more consumer touch points for the brand.", "Additionally, we saw a very strong performance in men's boots, which were up 50%. With Timberland PRO, we continue to gain traction with great innovations like our anti-fatigue technology. Strong sales in the category helped fuel the launch of an aftermarket insole product, which saw very strong shipments in its first season. PRO continues to set the standard for comfort and protection needs for the very demanding industrial consumer.", "As I mentioned, Timberland's D2C business achieved strong growth in the Americas in the quarter as our targeted operational initiatives designed to drive conversion took hold. Our product to zero [ph] campaign, featuring Hookset in store windows, on our e-commerce platform and throughout our direct digital marketing, was incredibly successful in driving conversion. Conversion was up in all formats throughout the quarter.", "Overall, we're very pleased with Timberland's progress and the advances we've made on our strategic initiatives to position the brand for long-term growth.", "Now here's Karl Heinz to take you through Timberland's International business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's revenues outside of the Americas were down at the high single-digit rate, with revenues in Europe down at the low double-digit rate, with sales in Asia up about 10% on a constant dollar basis. In Europe, conditions remained especially tough with Timberland, with the wholesale business down at the mid-teen rate due to challenging economic conditions. We've been particularly encouraged by our D2C results for Timberland in Europe, with positive comps in the first half. And regardless of top line, we achieved much stronger profitability, which points to underlying operational health, so good confidence there.", "For the balance of the year, we expect to see improving trends. Similar to the Americas, we continue to make progress on our plans to extend the brand's year-round relevance. Here too, the men's Hookset collection performed incredibly well in the quarter, particularly in the wholesale channel, giving us great confidence in the future. On the women's side, boat shoes saw very strong sell-throughs during the quarter, and sales were also robust in women's sneaker in both our wholesale and retail channels.", "In Asia, growth came from both women's and men's footwear. In particular, we saw strength in core yellow boots and heritage boot shows -- boot shoes on the men's side. Growth in women's came from core yellow boots, Classic Unlined Boat Shoes and the Casco Bay collection.", "We also expanded our direct-to-consumer business with 4 new retail doors during the quarter, as well as 3 shop-in-shops and 2 outlet stores. Very strong growth for the quarter in China, with revenues up nearly 40%. And we continue to feel confident about our future expansion opportunities.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Wrangler.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter global revenues for Wrangler were down 1%, with about flat results in our overall Americas business. These results were in line with our expectations, and the Wrangler business is on track to meet our full year goals.", "By channel, our Western business saw solid results, with revenues up mid-single digits, driven by continued momentum in our premium performance Cowboy Cut jeans. We continue to prove to this very important and growing customer base that we know what they want: comfort, durability and unique style.", "To push this momentum, we are gearing up for a comprehensive launch of the premium performance Cowboy Cut with advanced comfort in the fourth quarter, including in-store print, radio and TV marketing. The product will also be featured in our new patch campaign, which we'll launch in the third quarter.", "Our mass channel business was down slightly, primarily due to a shift in shipments from the second into the third quarter. Accordingly, this business is expected to be up around 10% in the third quarter.", "We're also making meaningful headway working with our key retail partners to enhance our brand's in-store presentation. In fact, we have a number of initiatives and programs geared at enhancing the way that consumers experience the Wrangler brand and ensuring that they fully understand the Wrangler story of innovation, authenticity and value.", "Our Americas non-U.S. business, which is one of the fastest-growing regions for the Wrangler brand, also showed solid, high single-digit growth, and it's well on its way to posting the highest growth rate of any of our regions for the full year.", "And now here's Karl Heinz with a few words on Europe.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Our Wrangler business in Europe was up slightly compared with last year, and our gross margin and profitability continues to improve. On the product front, we are starting to see some bright spots. Our innovation focus on denim performance and fit is paying off. And our new products are selling too well. We are also experiencing pockets of strength in a few of our key markets across Europe, particularly in Germany, Poland and Russia.", "Now back to Scott with Lee.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Our Lee brand delivered exceptional growth of 10% on a global basis during the quarter. Revenues in the Americas were up mid-teens, driven by great response to our seasonal business, as well as very strong growth in our core business, particularly in men's. Our hard work to create new growth opportunities, particularly in the mid-tier channel, is also starting to pay off, with the launch of 7 new product innovations and really strong orders for fall shipments. We are spot on in terms of giving our customers and wholesale partners what they want. And we're particularly proud of the results that we're seeing at our Comfort Fit for women and Modern Series for men, 2 lines I speak frequently about, and for good reason: they're driving success. We're also really pleased with our Platinum Label collection's ability to generate continued momentum, a product line that continues to open new doors. In fact, by the end of this year, the line will be in more than 450 locations with our key department store partners.", "We also want to make sure that consumers can more easily discover the brand and understand the story, so we're working with some of our major partners to roll out enhanced brand signage and merchandising, which you'll begin to see in August. We anticipate that these enhancements will raise visibility and ultimately drive higher volume in these accounts.", "Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Lee's international business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In Europe, Lee brand revenues were up slightly during the second quarter. And similar to the Americas, we are very encouraged with the early success we have seen with our new product innovations.", "During the quarter, we were very pleased with the solid sell-through of our new Stretch Deluxe women's product, leading to growth in the women's category overall. Additionally, our new men's collection, Blue Label, is outperforming expectations, with great response to the product's outstanding fit and comfort.", "In Asia, as expected, business was challenging in the first half as the wholesale channel continues to work through its denim inventory overhang. While business was still down in the second quarter, there was a sequential improvement and, in line with our expectation of the business, beginning to normalize in the fourth quarter of this year. And even with the decline in revenues, our profitability was up as it benefited from lower product costs and favorable product mix, so a nice offset there.", "Our spring '13 collection was well received by consumers, especially our Urban Riders and vintage laundry [ph] products.", "Overall, based on the strong response to our product offerings so far, we are confident that we'll begin to see healthy growth once we get the channel inventory levels properly aligned.", "And now here's Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, thanks, K.H. During our Investor Day last month, we had the opportunity to showcase our powerful brands and our powerful platforms. And as I mentioned at that meeting, having the right strategies, the right brands and the ability to deliver consistently on our promise to shareholders, well, that's worked pretty well for us. Our second quarter and first half results demonstrate these strengths, so let's take a look at how we did.", "Let me start with revenues. Total revenues grew 4%. We remain on track with our full year guidance of $11.5 billion. On a regional basis, revenues in the U.S. were up 3%, with growth in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses. Total international revenues were up 6% in the quarter, driven by 10% growth in both the Americas, that's non-U.S., and Asia-Pacific regions, including 17% growth in China.", "Revenues in Europe were up 2%. And to remind you, Timberland's European business, which is VF's largest European brand, continues to be impacted by challenging economic conditions. So Timberland did have a fairly significant negative impact to VF's total European revenues in the quarter. In fact, excluding Timberland, total European revenues grew by 8%.", "And global direct-to-consumer revenues were up 8% in the quarter, or 9%, excluding the impact from the sale of the John Varvatos brand. With positive direct-to-consumer results for nearly every brand in the entire VF portfolio, we are really pleased with the revenues and earnings that our D2C businesses continue to drive.", "Okay, let's turn to gross margin. So even after the press release and also Eric's comments, yes, I'm going to mention it a third time, our gross margin rate for the quarter came in at 48.5%, an all-time VF record. The 240-basis-point improvement reflects an even better performance than we originally anticipated and as a result of lower product costs and a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses. And consistent with our first quarter, we saw a gross margin improvement in almost every business.", "Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues rose 100 basis points to 39.4% in the second quarter, with approximately half of the increase stemming from our growing D2C business and about half due to increased marketing investments in our brands.", "As we've said in the past, this is an investment year in direct-to-consumer, with a record high number of store openings planned. As you know, our D2C business is strongest in the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter, so that's when we expect the lion's share of benefit to come through from these investments. Rest assured, we remain vigilant about controlling costs and managing our investments to ensure the right balance of growth and profitability across each of our brands and businesses.", "Adjusted operating margin improved 140 basis points to 9.3%, driven by our strong gross margin performance. Taking this down to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.27 from $1.11 during last year's same period. Additionally, if you consider that last year's second quarter included a non-recurring $0.10 per share discrete tax benefit, our adjusted EPS was 16 -- was 26%. Growth was 26%. So overall, a very, very strong quarter.", "So let's dig in a bit deeper on overall coalition results, starting with our largest contributor to growth, Outdoor & Action Sports. Total second quarter revenue growth of 6% was in line with expectations and included solid results from The North Face, Vans, Kipling and Reef. On the whole, the growth was pretty well balanced across geographies in between D2C and wholesale channels. And in addition to strong top line growth, Outdoor & Action Sports delivered outstanding profit growth of 22%, with a 120-basis-point improvement in operating margin in the quarter to 9.1%.", "And as Steve noted, and this bears repeating, the revenue cadence for The North Face, in particular, for the balance of the year will look a bit different than what you've seen in the past. Retailer caution is pushing out what typically would've been third quarter orders into the first quarter. Also, our retail calendar shift will reduce this year's September shipments, moving a week's worth of shipments into October. So as a result, revenues for The North Face should be up at a low single-digit rate in the third quarter. Excluding the calendar shift and the impact of retailers pushing back their shipments to as close to need as possible, The North Face's growth rate in the third quarter would be closer to our full year revenue growth expectation of a high single-digit rate. On the whole, we continue to expect our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition revenues to increase about 10% for the full year.", "Jeanswear revenue grew 3%, benefiting, in part, from the normalized shipping cadence of seasonal product in the Americas, where revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Jeanswear revenues for the European business were up 1%. And in our Asia-Pacific region, second quarter revenues declined at a mid-single-digit rate, which marks the sequential improvement over the first quarter as the Lee brand continues to work through the channel inventory issues that Karl Heinz mentioned previously. And of course, with the 17% increase in operating income, resulting in a 17.8% operating margin and improvement across all regions, well, I'd say a job well done to the Jeanswear team. I'm happy to report that we now expect the global Jeanswear revenue to increase at a low single-digit percentage rate for the full year, with our U.S. jeans business expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Next, let's review Imagewear. Revenues declined 4% versus last year. This is the result of a delay of a program renewal that we discussed on last quarter's call, a program that we now have orders against for the second half of the year. If we adjust for revenue related to this program, Imagewear revenues were up modestly in the quarter. Operating margin increased 240 basis points to 14.5%, driven by improved gross margin due to lower product costs. We're looking forward to progressively stronger top line results in our Imagewear coalition for the balance of the year. Based on orders in hand and a strong pipeline of new product initiatives in both the Image and Licensed Sports sides of the business, we expect Imagewear revenues to grow at a low single-digit rate for the full year.", "Sportswear delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, with revenues up 14%, right about where we expected. This 14% growth benefited from a 3-percentage-point shift in timing of shipments for the Nautica brand from the previous quarter. Kipling delivered outstanding growth of nearly 30%, with particular strength in its D2C business. Improved profitability at both wholesale and retail drove a 42% increase in operating income to $16 million or a 240-basis-point improvement in operating margin to 12.2%. For the full year, we now expect Sportswear revenues to increase about 10%. That's up from our original expectation of high single-digit growth.", "And finally, revenues for our Contemporary Brands coalition, which represents less than 4% of VF's total annual revenues, were down 9% in the quarter to $99 million, with 4 percentage points of the decline due to the exit of John Varvatos. The softness in our Contemporary Brands business is primarily attributable to weakness in premium denim in the high-end department store channel. Operating income fell 34% to $8 million in the second quarter, and operating margin fell 310 basis points to 8%. We continue to expect improved performance in the second half for this coalition, given the strong reception to our fall product collections. However, we now expect low single-digit revenue growth versus our previous expectation of high single-digit growth for the year.", "Now finishing off with some balance sheet and cash flow highlights, we remain extremely disciplined around inventory management. And as a result, inventories were down 3% year-over-year. Also happy to report that VF's pension plan is nearly fully funded. And with respect to cash from operations, we anticipate another year of exceptional cash generation, with the full year expected to top $1.4 billion. In the third quarter, we'll further strengthen our balance sheet by paying off $400 million in debt associated with the Timberland acquisition. And finally, we'll be out of commercial paper by the end of the year, resulting in a balance sheet that's ready to support future investment.", "And with that, let's turn to our full year outlook. While we see some shifting in our outlook for revenues at the coalition level, there is no change to our February expectation of growing total VF revenues by 6% to $11.5 billion in 2013. And given our strong gross margin results thus far, full year gross margin is now expected to slightly exceed the previously anticipated 100-basis-point improvement over 2012. Factoring all of this in, our adjusted earnings per share is now expected to rise to $10.85, $0.10 higher than our previous guidance of $10.75, representing a 13% increase over 2012.", "And as Eric mentioned, if we see additional strength in our gross margin, we will likely make investments in our business now that will yield future returns. By investing to strengthen our core capabilities, including product innovation, technology, supply chain, direct-to-consumer and sustainability efforts, we're ensuring our ability to deliver consistent, long-term growth and returns to our shareholders.", "And looking at the revenue cadence for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be consistent with our full year growth expectation. If you consider the previously mentioned retailer caution, which will affect shipments for The North Face, and the impact of the September into October calendar shift, which affects both The North Face and our Sportswear businesses, third quarter revenue comparisons would be more balanced with fourth quarter. So accordingly, we expect to see the strongest revenue comparisons of the year in the fourth quarter given these timing shifts, as well as the expansion of our direct-to-consumer business, which really comes together in the fourth quarter.", "So in closing, our first half performance exceeded our expectations. We are firing on all cylinders with a terrific portfolio of brands, expanding our business internationally, growing our D2C business and focusing on innovation and, most importantly, our consumers, all of which gives us great confidence that we'll deliver yet another year of record growth for VF and our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob. That concludes our prepared comments. Operator, we'd love to open the lines for the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Bob, can I just clarify quickly the comments you made on the revenue guidance just there. I think you're saying that -- maybe you were saying this third quarter would be in line with the annual 6% guidance, excluding the shifts, and -- but then be lower if you include the shifts. Is that -- did I read that correctly?", "Robert K. Shearer", "No -- yes, you're right, Michael. What we're saying is that third quarter revenues will be in line, right, with the 6% annual guidance. That includes the impact, obviously, of the shifts that we mentioned. So what we're saying is the third quarter, otherwise, would've been stronger. We said the third quarter would've been more balanced with the fourth quarter had it not been for the revenue shifts. So the 6% includes those shifts.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you help us gross up the comments on The North Face cadence that you talked about to the overall Outdoor coalition outlook for third and fourth quarter?", "Steven E. Rendle", "So Michael, I'm not sure I completely understand what you mean by gross up.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So it sounds like there's going to be some North Face order growth shifted into fourth quarter from the third quarter. How does that trend -- how does that fit within the guidance for the Outdoor revenue growth in the back half between third quarter and fourth quarter?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure, sure, okay. So the shifts that we've mentioned in the calendar, coupled with the retailer caution, we see a shift from Q3, what we've seen historically in Q3 to Q4. Without those shifts, we'd see a much more balanced order flow, shipment flow, with -- but as we're looking at it today, we've got a low single-digit for Q3 and a high -- or a low double-digit for Q4.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Michael, so for the third quarter for Outdoor & Action Sports, I think this is -- I want to make sure we answer your question. So the third quarter would look pretty much in line with -- once again, with our annual guidance of the 6%, to be more in line. And then obviously, the fourth quarter will be considerably stronger.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And can you comment on where the backlogs are today for The North Face?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Sure. The backlog for The North Face, the shape of our order window this year is a bit different. As I mentioned, the calendar shift and the caution. The order book we have in hand is in line with our expectations. It was absolutely understood and calculated in the high single-digit full year guidance that we provided in February.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, a couple of questions. The -- just the first question is, you've mentioned retailer cautiousness in the Americas for North Face several times. Are you seeing retailer cautiousness across other brands, and why or why not? And then the second question is just on the gross margin outlook. I think you guys said something to the effect of you could see more -- I think, Bob, you might have said you could see more gross margin upside, but you may invest in that further upside. Can you walk us through what could drive further gross margin upside versus your guidance and then, also, what kind of spending you would envision implementing beyond what's in the plan right now if you get that gross margin upside?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Okay, Robbie. Bob and I will go back and forth on some of these. First question about retailer cautiousness, is it just for The North Face. And if not, it's not a North Face issue, it's an outdoor industry issue. The outdoor industry in North America has suffered 2 much warmer-than-normal winters. And because of that -- and there's been inventory overhang at the end of each season, as you have seen. This year, we got a little lucky in that spring was cool, and we sold a lot of that stuff through. So it's not The North Face, it's for all the brands that play in that space. Retailers are buying much closer to demand. They're going to wait and see how the weather unfolds. However, the orders that we have don't assume a frigid winter. It assumes a modest improvement in the weather patterns for this year. Notice we didn't talk about that for Europe, and the reason for that is Europe had a cold winter last year. They had a nice, healthy, cold, wet winter. And so the buying there from our -- from the retailers who buy our brands, this is just at a much more normal cadence, so they didn't have that issue to deal with. Bob, do you want to talk about the gross margin?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure. Yes, Robbie, so one of the things that we've been seeing relative to our gross margin is the mix has been very favorable. In the second quarter, for example, you know that mix has been averaging around 60 or 70 basis points on a full year basis of benefit. And in the second quarter, it was more like 80. So that's been one of the factors that's been very positive to us. And our gross margins have just been running very, very strongly all year long. And we talk a lot about reductions in product costs, the mix piece, of course, and this will be there and is there. The product cost reductions as well have especially benefited the first half. But the other thing that's been very strong for us is our inventory management. So we talked in the third -- in the second quarter that our inventories were down by 3%. Lower inventories means less risks. It means we sell off less at lower prices, and it improves our gross margin. So those are the kind of things that could help us as we look to the third and fourth quarters. In addition to that, we're always going to be a little cautious on our gross margin and our gross margin expectations. There's still a lot of the year to go. Now relative to those investments, they'd be the same kind of investments that we've been making in the past. This is the same kind of thing that we've done. When we're seeing some room in the gross margin, we've taken that opportunity to make investments, particularly, I'd say, in 2 areas, primarily in the marketing side as well as product. And it's also very, very likely that a lot of those investments would be made behind our 5 largest brands, which is what we've been doing, especially behind our 3 -- the top 3 brands that are in the Outdoor & Action Sports area. But beyond that, to address opportunities, for example, in Asia and China specifically, as we see the opportunities there, we would make investments against those opportunities as well. So very consistent with what we've done. Again, it's been very good for us over the past, and we'd do the same kinds of things looking forward.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Robbie, we talk a lot about that one of the strengths of VF is the number of levers that we have to pull to keep moving forward. We clearly have places in geographies in the world that are not conducive to additional investment, and we have some many that are. Bob mentioned a really important one, which is China. We -- as you know, with that fantastic growth Karl Heinz mentioned that in Asia Pacific, our North Face business was up 40% in the quarter, and that business is really moving. So one of the places we might invest would be behind The North Face in China. And we look at each brand and each geography and look at brands like Kipling or The North Face or any of the top 5, where we have a lot of momentum. And we need to keep that momentum going because there's some markets that are just struggling right now. Does that help you?", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, that's very helpful. That's terrific.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Another question or a follow-up, guys, on the really strong gross margin. Are you seeing -- are lower input costs really still a driver there? Are there new technologies, platforms, efficiencies in your supply chain that are also benefiting?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, Rob -- well, Omar, especially in the second quarter and in the first half of the year, the product cost benefit was a big driver. So it was a combination of mix and then product cost was a significant driver, as well as the efficiencies that we saw. So yes, in addition to that, however, our supply chain is a competitive weapon, and we've talked about that very consistently. And as others are feeling the pinch of higher costs, we're, in many, many cases, able to offset those costs through efficiencies in our own plants. We make more product in our plants than any of our competitors. So it is a combination of things. And yes, we do think that that competitive advantage is clearly a benefit for us and has been helping us in the gross margin, not just this year but in the past as well.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Eric, real quick, I know you guys highlighted the long-term growth plan, including both organic and acquisitive growth. As your -- is the M&A focus, still broadly speaking, still generally focused on the Outdoor & Action Sports area? Are you seeing any interesting opportunities outside of that segment?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, Omar, we've consistently said that the focus of our M&A activity would be in the Outdoor & Action Sports area. But that is -- that does not exclude other opportunities. There are clearly other opportunities out there that we are always poking around and seeing what makes sense. We look at it from the standpoint of what will be complementary to our portfolio that would enable us to deliver consistently strong earnings per share growth to our shareholders and where we can add some value. I know that's vague, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's not just in Outdoor & Action Sports, but that is a place where we have big global platforms and a lot of success and momentum and would be a place which we're always looking there. Does that help you?", "Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's really helpful, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Barclays.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The -- I guess the first question there is, to go back on the gross margin reinvestment, would those decisions on the reinvestment be made intra-quarter or sort of in following quarters? So if gross margin is tracking ahead of, let's say, the third quarter, would you reinvest those dollars in that quarter or would you wait and sort of change the plan for the fourth quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "We -- I think we'd make those decisions when the opportunity for a good investment comes along. And if matched with the additional gross margin, we need to fund it. We're looking at the back half of the year. Obviously, at some point, we'll run out of runway to make investments, so we have to make some of those decisions. We can't make them all in December, obviously.", "Steven E. Rendle", "But what we do, Bob, is we have -- constantly, we have a list of those areas that we'd like to invest, right, that have either proven really good investments for us in the past or where, with our current judgment, we think they will be great investments. So we keep that on hand consistently and look for these opportunities. And when they arise, we release the funding.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just have a question on The North Face as well. Historically, The North Face has really been consistently stronger than the outdoor industry. And has anything really changed within the brand performance? Because you just appear to be talking a little bit more of an industry concern impacting that brand than we've been accustomed to over the last 10 years. So I'm just trying to understand if there's anything else at play from the brand perspective as you look at the back half of this year.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Bob, this is Steve. There is nothing additional at play with The North Face as we look at the back half or even as we look into next year. As Eric had mentioned, the outdoor industry really has been impacted as -- with these last 2 winters. The impact of the warmer, drier winters and the consumer demand and product sell-through has really been significant. We've talked about it quite often. We couldn't be more confident about the product pipeline that we have in play for fall '13. That's feeding into 2014 our ability to build brand awareness and then help drive conversion not only within our own stores but within our partner stores. We're very, very confident with where The North Face is, and it's really just navigating through these last 2 years of warm, dry winters.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And Bob, if I may aid, this is Karl Heinz. I guess, a 40% growth in China and a 10% growth in Europe, which is not the easiest market at the moment, as we all know, proves that The North Face is still performing extremely well.", "Robert K. Shearer", "On a global basis, Bob, being up high single digits for the year, we think, is taking share.", "Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I could just sneak in a question for Scott, on the -- in the Lee business in the U.S., mid-teens growth in -- I guess, in the Americas, can you just elaborate a little bit more than you did in your prepared remarks around that strong performance and sort of where that growth exactly is coming from?", "Scott H. Baxter", "Bob, yes, no problem at all. One -- or a couple of things. We had really strong seasonal sales, which we talked a little bit about the shift in the first quarter, so that all came in. We're real pleased. But I think the single most important thing for the Lee business in all the Americas is product. Our product is really terrific. And as we come in to the back-to-school, fall holiday season, you're going to see several new innovations and introductions from us, most notably the Modern Series product for men and the Comfort Fit for women. But our order book for those and the orders for those upcoming are just outstanding, and it's really resonating with the consumers. So what we've done is, knowing that we've got such good product in the pipeline, we've really enhanced our in-store imagery and our in-store POS. And on top of that, our marketing campaigns and advertising for the fall and the winter, I think you'll be real pleased with. So I look at it holistically and think about the business, and I just couldn't be more pleased with what the people are doing because, at the end of the day, it's about the product. And it's really resonating with our consumers, and we're really, really happy with where we are right now in the Lee business.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, I agree with Scott, Bob. And what -- there's a channel thing going on here, too. The mid-tier channel is stronger right now than it was earlier this year. And as you are probably aware, we've been launching -- or introducing, I guess, is a better way to put it -- the Lee brand into the department store channel with several national department stores here. And those -- what were tests last year are getting additional roll out this year. So we're -- we've got the brand in a new channel, department stores, and the mid-tier channel is healthier. And that's supported by all these great products. And the in-store marketing, as Scott was talking about, is delivering pretty terrific results for that business right now.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess first question, just in terms of your guidance -- kind of implied guidance for the back half, I think Steve already made the comment that fall orders on The North Face are sort of tracking in line with expectations for the year. I would assume that comment probably applies to kind of the overall business as a whole in terms of backlog. So how do you guys -- how are you guys thinking about in terms of reorders and maybe your comp on your DTC business? I mean, do you expect reorders to be better in the back half than a year ago? Are you expecting a positive comp on DTC? And kind of what's the underlying sort of weather assumption behind all of that? Are you guys assuming a normal winter? Are you assuming the winter that's similar to last year?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, the assumption about winter is we're assuming a modest improvement in the North American winter from what we've seen in the last 2 years. As I mentioned to a response from an earlier question, the winter in Europe last year was fine. It was kind of an average European winter. And we're expecting an average Europe winter this year, with a modest improvement in the U.S.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Mitch, was the rest of your question specifically about North Face?", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "No, it's kind of the company as a whole. I mean, I guess if you're assuming a modest improvement in the winter in North America, then that would suggest that you expect sort of reorders to be better than what they were a year ago, kind of across all of your business.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Well, Mitch, I can -- let me kind of start with The North Face because I think The North Face is probably the brand that -- I know you've asked quite a bit over the years about our reorder. We do not see a dramatic shift in our fall reorder demand. We are prepared for a little bit more on the historical high level of maybe high single digits when, normally, we've been in the mid-single digits. We've got a great insight into our order book. It's a stickier order book than last year. As Eric mentioned, we are expecting a more normalized winter. And with the innovations that we've put into the marketplace, as we've showed in the last spring's trade shows, in each of our activities, outdoors, snow sports, as well as our performance, we really feel we've got a great balance of new innovations that meet the needs of consumers in these -- in the warmer climates, colder climates, and that were set up very, very well to deliver that high single-digit growth rate for the year.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Mitch, yes, I think the other factor is direct-to-consumer, right?", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right.", "Robert K. Shearer", "So I made the comment earlier that this is -- this will be a record year for us in terms of new store openings. Direct-to-consumer becomes a bigger part of VF Corporation not just from stores but also on the e-com side of things. As I said earlier, a lot of that comes together in the fourth quarter. So that's also -- I mean, that's also part of the revenue cadence that we're looking at in second half, for example, versus first half because it's a big piece of our business.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "We'll have a lot of new stores by the end of this year that didn't exist last year. To help you -- I think part of your question is like how aggressive is this assumption, right? And to help frame that for you, first half of the year, globally, our direct-to-consumer comps were mid-single-digit. Second half of the year, we're assuming high-single-digit. Is that driven by improvement? Not so much. It's driven by mix, where we have a lot of stores in cold weather brands, and we're expecting the winter mix to be -- that they'll be a bigger part of our business and we are expecting kind of a normal winter around -- in Europe and, as I said, a slight improvement in the U.S.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. And then my second question is on your growth on your margin. Maybe it's -- 2 parts to this. One, Bob, could you be more specific on the gross margin now for the year? I mean, you're looking at like 120-basis-points improvement versus the prior guidance of 100. How should we think about that kind of split-out in the back half? Would you expect more gross margin expansion in Q4 than Q3 because of the big impact on DTC?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes. So Mitch, I won't be quite that specific, right, in terms of the gross margin. But relative to the third and fourth quarters, you're absolutely right. The third quarter gross margin expansion will not be quite as strong as the fourth quarter, and that's driven by a couple of factors. Mix, number one. The mix and the shifting of those -- of the revenues, particularly North Face, which is a brand of ours that has very, very high gross margins, when we move some of those revenues into the fourth quarter, obviously, it pulls some margin away from third and puts it into fourth. And then the other big factor, of course, is direct-to-consumer. When all that comes together in the fourth quarter, with substantially higher gross margins in D2C, that will drive the fourth quarter gross margin expansion stronger than the third quarter.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then the Jeanswear operating margin, I think it's tracking around 19% through the first half. Is that kind of a number that we should be thinking at on an annual basis? And if that's the case, I mean, that's a couple points better than what the prior high watermark was for that business. I mean, is that a sustainable level?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, the jeans operating margins is what we're referring to. The jeans operating margins, right, will get back in the fourth quarter to the levels that we've been used to over the years. So high watermark for the year, we think about it as being a little bit more normalized with where we've been. Now when I say where we've been, in better years, right? So in our stronger years in the denim side of things in our Jeanswear business, yes, we're back on track with that, and we do think that that's a very sustainable level for us going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'm going to ask another question about The North Face. Now that you have a good read into the order book for that back half of the year, I was just wondering if the mix of orders are any different than you expected and if there's any impact to your margins and your delivery of the product as a result?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, Kate, this is Steve. As we look at our order book, there is no dramatic shift in the mix. It's just really the timing that we've seen move from Q3 and Q4 for the reasons we've explained. So no dramatic shift there at all, very similar to years past.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second question is on Timberland. I think, Steve, you mentioned in your comments that there's still -- I interpreted it as cleanup of the brand. I just wondered how many more quarters we can expect of this. And also, just with regards to the Timberland apparel, is it in the stores yet and do you have any early reaction by customers?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Right. So from an Americas point, I can talk about it, and Karl Heinz can come back with the international side. But -- so on the -- what we see going on in our wholesale business, we put a tremendous amount of effort into product segmentation and very, very diligent about just putting the right product in the right channels, as well as bringing the disciplines of our go-to-market model into Timberland. And now as we come to our second year, I would tell you, you would -- you're going to hear us to talk very consistently about the impact and the positive benefits of that. On the apparel, it has yet to ship. We will be shipping here in the United States against our relaunch plan, which is very -- it's not a large amount of revenue this year, it's really a relaunch. And as I've mentioned before, just a very careful and thoughtful choice of retail partners across better department stores, specialty and outdoor specialty, that will be coming into the marketplace towards the end of August. And I know Lance will be talking here shortly about a preview that we'll be having in the New York City next month. And we're really excited to introduce you to the products that we'll be relaunching here in the U.S.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "From an international point of view, let's start, Kate, with Asia, which has been consistently strong. And even this quarter, we reported in constant dollars a 10% increase. So Asia is not a problem. Asia is performing well on most categories, footwear and apparel. The problem we have is in Europe. Timberland is our largest brand in Europe, and as we said in the past, it's pretty heavily exposed to Southern Europe. And we all know Southern Europe is not the strongest at the moment. It's hard to sell anything there at the moment. So that doesn't mean that we don't see opportunities. A lot happened with Timberland in the last 12 months. We moved headquarters, we changed systems there in our system, a lot of initiatives, which would put a lot of stress in other companies, but we managed it well. I mentioned in my script we see the situation improving. 2013 will still be negative from a growth point of view, but we have very good signals, which make us very confident also in Europe.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask on the inventories. You had a nice spread between inventory growth and sales. How much of that is a function of the delayed shipment of North Face product or other things we should be aware of as it relates to those 2?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, really not related to that, we continue to -- one of the bigger pieces in terms of the reduction in inventory was Timberland. We just continue to find ways to reduce those inventories and buying and producing product closer to needs. So it was a significant piece of it. And beyond that, it's just an area where we've put a lot of focus, and that focus is paying off. We're more efficient. We're just better at managing inventories and producing and buying product closer to needs. So really not related to some of the shifts that we've talked about from a revenue standpoint.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on Timberland, you've talked about the FX-neutral mid-single-digit guidance. Can you -- what -- based on where spot rates are, how you're thinking about currency on a all-in, including currency basis, what would be your expectation for revenue growth for the year?", "Robert K. Shearer", "I don't know that I have that in front of me for Timberland. So it -- although I can tell you this. I mean, based on the euro, it wouldn't be a significant difference. So actually, the difference -- the bigger difference was in Japan. It was Japan. So I think there, we were in mid- to high-single-digit growth for the full year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes. And as you know, Lindsay, Japan is our largest market in Asia for Timberland.", "Robert K. Shearer", "For the full year. Yes, overall, for the full year, not a big factor.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple questions. So some odd weather patterns this spring following what were odd weather patterns in the winter. Where we sit right now, what are retailer inventories looking like? And for those businesses, they're based on forward bookings. Are you getting any visibility that gives you confidence you can get back to that high single-digit organic growth objective looking into spring '14?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Jim, this is Steve. With the first half of 2013, yes, certainly, we had really good winter weather patterns, and we saw strong sell-through of the goods they've carried in. But even more importantly, we saw a really good sell-through of our spring products, specifically fleece, lightweight insulation and rain shells. And we were really happy with where we see retail inventories today, giving us the opportunity to really get our new product well positioned and upfront in front of the consumer as it starts to ship into our dealers this month and next month. We absolutely have confidence that we will return to the historic prebook rates that we've seen in the past. And some of that is weather, Jim, but it's also how we're focusing on our product pipeline, looking at both all 3 of the activities of outdoor, snow sports and performance, new introductions of footwear. We spoke last month about our Ultra Protection Series, a new training launch around mountain athletics as we're able to really start to increase penetration of spring, spring product, as well as new insulations like we have in Thermoball and other such innovations coming into fall. So very, very confident about -- as we move into more normalized weather patterns but also being able to wait our product offering across the categories to be able to mitigate anything in the future.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Eric, just a follow-up on kind of the U.S. consumer. I appreciate your commentary on the outdoor segment and kind of the retailer approach there. You mentioned the mid-tier as well, which I assume is some improvement in JCPenney. But just overall, I think investors are probably expecting a little better retail environment in Q2 versus Q1 based on how cool it was this year in Q1. It doesn't appear that that's necessarily played out. I just wondered, as the environment continue to be very uneven and choppy and what, if anything, does it say to you about the U.S. consumer heading into back-to-school?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, David, the U.S. consumer, a lot of people use the word resilient to talk about the U.S. consumer, and I think they use it because it's a fair word to describe what we're seeing. I would add inconsistent. You said choppy. We are absolutely seeing that in our business. From week to week, it's hard to see a consistent trend line. It's kind of up-and-down and up-and-down. But as it's coming out, a global comment, in the first half of the year, our direct-to-consumer business was up mid-single-digit, and it was up in the United States. So we are seeing growth in the United States market, but it's been a little choppy, using your words. But we're confident that we have the right numbers dialed into our forecast for the rest of this year. We absolutely are seeing both from our wholesale partners that we ship to and in our stores. The trend supports the forecast that we have for the balance of this year.", "David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And do you see an opportunity in the mid-tier in the second half? You're gaining some traction there, it sounds like.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, we are. That channel struggled, as everyone knows, the last 12 to 15 months, and it's coming back pretty nicely right now.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up, actually, on Timberland. Karl, you had made some comments about Europe. I guess, could you just dig a little deeper as to why you're expecting improvement into the back half of the year? I think you've -- Karl, we talked about this in the past, but maybe just kind of recap us on what's going to drive the improvement and, importantly, if that's both at sales and margin or one more than another.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Sure. Let me try to give you facts but also what we hear from -- in the market from our customers. The facts, I guess, I mentioned in our DTC comps were positive in the first half. That shows that the brand is doing pretty well. The big problem we have is really the exposure to certain markets in the Southern Hemisphere. There's a lot going on in those markets. A lot of small stores are simply dying, and we have to -- we are reacting to that. What we hear also from the brand, we went the first time to a pretty large show in Berlin called Bread and Butter, where the brand went out the very first time. And the response from -- we got from the customers was really, really strong. Karstadt is a large customer, a large chain in Germany. They started to list us again. We lost them a few years ago. So we see a lot of good signals, which makes us believe that 2014 will be better than we see today. And it's our highest priority because, as we know -- as we said, Timberland is our largest brand in Europe.", "Robert K. Shearer", "I think in Europe -- I think, David, in Europe, our footwear collection is stronger and more relevant, and that's why we got the bookings we got. And we're not relying on Southern European economies to rebound to get healthy. That's not in our assumptions. What we're doing is focused on economies where there's more active consumer engagement. Karl Heinz just mentioned Germany and selling -- getting back into a large customer there. That's we're doing to stabilize the business and make up for some of the Southern European economies where it's been so difficult.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got you. So your internal plan is more -- or is kind of one part more, perhaps, weak but stable trends in Southern Europe, but then, really, what's driving the kind of sequential improvement would be kind of the shift into other better economies? Is that [indiscernible]", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Supported by much better product than we had last year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "That is correct, yes. We have great presence with the brand in Central Europe, which is pretty stable. Germany, Austria, Switzerland is doing okay. In the U.K., it's doing good; well in Scandinavia. And also, there's a large presence, growing presence in the emerging markets, which spans from Russia down to Turkey.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on how you feel about inventories in the channel, particularly in the Americas, if there are any call-outs? It would be helpful.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "In general, with the exception of the Jeanswear business in China, the channels are clean. We have an inventory overhang in denim in China that we've been -- had all year, started in late last year. But in North America, for sure, inventories are clean throughout the channels. In Europe, actually, there may be some places in Southern Europe where there's still a little bit of an inventory glut, economies where consumers have -- are not as engaged. But on the macro level for VF as a material issue, it is not overall for VF.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "How comfortable are you with your ability to supply the order book that you have and potentially capture any business if weather is favorable?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "We're completely comfortable with our ability to meet the order book that we have, completely. Our inventory is not only lean, but it's aligned. So we have pretty good visibility of our fall orders, and we're prepared to meet those orders. We've shipped really well all year. We have not had -- we've -- our service this year may end up at a record high despite the winter inventories. So we're in good shape.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And I'd also say we're better positioned than most to chase if needed, given our own manufacturing, as well as our scale and size, to chase orders.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to your speakers for any closing or additional remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Sure. Thanks, Mary. Thank you for being on the call. I said during the call we're on track this year, and we are on track for this year. The orders are coming in as we thought. The one -- the revenue is where we thought it would be, and the cadence of that is as we thought it would be. The only thing we missed in our original plan for the year is our gross margin. We undershot the reality there, but we're not apologizing for that. So we'll talk to you in 90 days and tell you how the third quarter went. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's third quarter 2013 results.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements under definition of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions, and we'll ask that you limit your initial questions to 2. [Operator Instructions]", "I'll now turn the call over to VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that we're very proud of the solid results we achieved in our third quarter, especially earnings that far exceeded our expectations. While we faced some headwinds associated with the challenging economic environment and consumer buying behavior that was a little inconsistent market to market, I have great confidence that we'll finish 2013 strong and post another record year for VF.", "I'm more excited now than I've ever been by the long-term growth prospects for VF. In June, we laid out a detailed 5-year growth plan supported by a sharp focus on 4 powerful strategic actions: leading through innovation, connecting with consumers, serving those consumers directly and expanding geographically. We're already making meaningful progress that's consistent with and sometimes ahead of our expectations. Our powerful ecosystem of brands and platforms, combined with proven strategies and great execution, enable us to consistently deliver on our growth objectives.", "Every day at VF, every brand at VF works tirelessly to deliver innovative products, to find better and more creative ways to connect with and inspire our consumers, and we're always working to engineer new ways to be even more efficient and effective across our operations. In the third quarter, we grew revenues by 5% to $3.3 billion, reflecting strength in all global regions and across both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. The retailer calendar shift negatively impacted these growth rates by 2 percentage points. At the brand level, 14 of our 15 largest brands grew revenues on a global basis, and the one that missed was due to that retail calendar shift. So I'd say that's a pretty good success rate.", "Gross margin once again exceeded our expectations, reaching 47.6%, a 90-basis-point improvement that we've seen across nearly every business. This improvement was primarily driven by our favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses with some contribution from lower product costs. In fact, taking a look at mix in our higher-margin businesses, the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition reached 60% of total VF revenues in the quarter. International reached 40%, and Direct-to-Consumer reached 19%, all trending up and tracking well against our 5-year goals.", "Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 17.6%, driven by gross margin expansion and underlying cost control. And speaking of costs, on the last call, you heard me say that if we were to see further gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, we'd remain opportunistic and consider investing those dollars to support our 5-year commitment to our shareholders, and that's exactly what we're doing. In fact, we think a challenging environment is the ideal time to upshift and hit the gas pedal a bit harder on marketing and product initiatives, supporting and helping to drive traffic to our wholesale partners, and of course, our own Direct-to-Consumer business by strengthening our connection with consumers, and creating even more meaningful engagement with our brands is key to our long-term success. Of course, this is not a new strategy for us. We did it at the same time last year and 3 years ago, exactly on this same day, we announced nearly $50 million of additional investments in The North Face, Vans and our business in China. And based on our strong results, particularly in those 3 areas during the past 3 years, we know this is a strategy that works and works quite well at VF.", "Since the last time we spoke, we've committed to an additional $40 million of marketing investments in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we spent $10 million. And in the fourth quarter, we'll spend another $30 million to help drive our business into 2014 and beyond. On an EPS basis, this is about $0.25 per share in the second half.", "Looking at the balance of the year, I'm particularly proud of the fact that even with these additional investments, our $10.85 adjusted earnings per share guidance is unchanged. And the 13% growth over 2012, this result is directly in line with our long-term earnings growth target.", "We're also returning more to our shareholders with the announcement of a 21% increase in our dividend. This marks the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases, a 4-decade record of returning value to our shareholders. And we announced a 4-for-1 stock split this morning, an action that reflects the confidence we have in our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth and the opportunity to make VF shares attractive to a potentially broader range of investors.", "In summary, we've got solid momentum across our largest brands and the financial resources to make additional investments to support this momentum and drive revenue gains while still delivering another outstanding year of results for VF shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott, who will take us through VF's top 5 brands. And Bob will close us out with a deeper look at our results. Steve, over to you.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Thanks, Eric. Third quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 3%, which is right on track with what we expected. Our D2C business was really strong, increasing more than 25% during the quarter, with balanced growth in all 3 regions. As expected, our wholesale business was flat. You'll recall from last quarter's call that in addition to order shifting from Q3 to Q4 because of retailer caution, our wholesale partners' calendars also shifted 1 week from September into October. Combined, these shifts pressured our third quarter results and moved revenue into this year's fourth quarter.", "Absent the calendar shift, which totaled about $40 million in revenues for The North Face, third quarter revenues would have been up nicely at a high-single digit rate. As you'd expect, you will see this benefit in our fourth quarter results when revenues should approximate a low double-digit growth rate.", "Revenues in the Americas region were up at the same rate as global North Face, 3%, with flat wholesale results that were held back by the calendar shift. D2C performance in the quarter, however, was very strong with 30% growth. In both channels, we were really encouraged with the trends we're seeing in apparel, footwear and equipment demand as we head into the cooler months ahead. In fact, when I think about The North Face business and the position we're in, especially in the context following 2 challenging winters here in the U.S., we're the best positioned to succeed in the outdoor industry.", "Given a terrific innovative product lineup, supported by a strong integrated marketing campaign, exciting programs with key wholesale partners and strong D2C momentum that we see continuing well into 2014, we are incredibly confident about the future.", "A great example of this work is Thermoball. As one of our biggest product innovations for this upcoming season, early reads on Thermoball have exceeded our expectations. In addition, due to very strong sell-through we've had in our own D2C, we're rolling out an exclusive in-store concept at 300 Dick's Sporting Goods locations, featuring Thermoball as part of an overall brand shop in their seasonal outerwear pad.", "On the marketing front, our new Never Stop Exploring campaign will be strengthened by the incremental investments that Eric mentioned. This emotional brand campaign does an incredible job of personalizing the meaning of outdoor exploration. Using all mediums, TV, print, digital and in-store, we're extremely confident this will intensify our connection with a wide range of North Face consumers.", "So all factors considered, we're right where we expected to be, and there is significant momentum in the Americas business moving into the fourth quarter, lining us up for a strong finish to the year.", "Now let me turn it over to Karl Heinz to discuss the North Face's International business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, the North Face business was down at the low single-digit rate. It was impacted by the opening of a new distribution center for the region. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to grow at the mid-teen rate. In the third quarter, momentum in our D2C business continued with revenues up nearly 20%, including more than 60% growth in our e-comm business.", "We're also seeing good early seasonal response to new product introductions with Thermoball being cited by wholesale partners as the best-selling insulator product among multiple points of distribution. On top of that, our European-specific designs continue to be a big hit as well with almost half of our product lineup now personalized for the unique local needs of this discerning consumer. No one is better positioned than we are to execute this strategy, which is a competitive advantage we're quite proud of as it builds long-term authenticity and creates confidence and loyalties with our consumers.", "On the marketing front, we recently launched our first pan-European inter-sport marketing campaign in 10 countries and 600 doors to TV, billboards, cinema, print and in-store. The featured product that takes center stage to the campaign is the exploration to a climate jacket, a premium outdoor piece with a GORE-TEX shell that is exclusive to winter sport. This represents meaningful collection points and a lot of good momentum in Europe going into the fourth quarter.", "Turning to Asia Pacific. We had a solid third quarter with revenues up 11% in the region driven by mid-teen percentage growth in China. And for the first time ever, we're about to launch a major national TV campaign known as the Explorer for The North Face [ph]. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we are doubling our marketing investment for this powerful brand in China, which will build consumer brand awareness and engage them in the outdoor market. Indeed, this is a very good example of incremental marketing spend you've heard us talk about today.", "Now back to Steve to talk about Vans.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Vans continues to be a very strong performer. Global revenues for Vans in the third quarter were up 16% with high-teen D2C growth and a mid-teen percentage increase in our wholesale business.", "In the brand's largest region, the Americas, revenues were up at a low-teens rate during the quarter with both the D2C and wholesale channels showing strong double-digit momentum on the heels of a solid back-to-school season. Vans' wholesale distribution discipline has been a key growth strategy for the brand for a decade and continues to prove its worth in 2013.", "Within footwear, growth across all aspiration channels has been significant with positive trends across all tiers, including double-digit growth in core board shop, boutique, lifestyle and family footwear channels.", "Vans also launched 2 new Pro Skater shoes using innovative performance characteristics, including WAFFLECUP, DURACAP and UltraCush in signature athlete models that have received strong adoption in core board shops. And just recently, we celebrated the anniversary of the LXVI launch at Foot Locker with a revised in-store branding execution and expanded the product categories to include the OTW and Classics collections.", "And I'm also happy to report that the actions we've taken across Vans apparel are gaining traction and expanding share. Vans apparel has cracked the top 10 men's brands in 8 of the 11 categories in Q3 of 2013 as measured by ActionWatch, which measures independent board shop trends, a key indicator of brand aspiration that creates downstream, wholesaler and consumer adoption. As recently as 2011, we were absent in these apparel rankings.", "And in apparel, we've moved into colder and wetter climates such as Canada and the Northeastern U.S. where product differentiation is important to retailers and expected from our consumers.", "Turning to D2C. We're in the process of finalizing enhancements to our D2C channel that will roll out early next year to improve the consumer experience and facilitate deeper connectivity. For our retail stores, we'll be implementing a new POS platform in the first half of 2014. And on the e-comm side, we're working on a new platform and enhanced content, which is set to launch sometime in the first quarter. These relationship-building initiatives will further enrich and expand Vans' deep consumer connectivity.", "Vans' strength in engaging its growing customer base through specific consumer activation platforms once again proved itself a value during the third quarter. Our first Vans U.S. Open of Surfing was a huge success with 750,000 attendees, 1.3 million web visits and 1.2 million media impressions over the course of 9 days. Our House of Vans platform extended our music activation strategy through various events in Q3, including pop-up House of Vans events in Canada and Mexico, 2 of the regions that we targeted for geographic expansion in 2013.", "Finally, we wrapped up the 19th year of the Vans Warped Tour in North America and sent them on their way to 6 dates in Europe and 6 dates in Australia to end out the year.", "Now over to Karl Heinz for some international highlights.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In Europe, Vans revenue was up 25%, underscoring the strength of the brand. We are confident that we will deliver another year of remarkable results in Europe. On the product side, we are focused on optimizing our cold weather footwear strategy by expanding our product offering and growing Vans' share against competitors.", "On the D2C front, we opened our first store in Dublin during the quarter, which coincided with our e-comm launch in Ireland. With this launch, we now have Vans e-comm platforms in 7 key countries across Europe, which is a nice growth since December 2012.", "Vans Asia Pacific business grew at the high single-digit rate during the third quarter. In Asia, we continue to support local initiatives to ensure that the brand remains inspirational to youth culture and relevant to the region, a strategy that is working very well for us. In China, our best-selling apparel categories are those that have been locally developed. We work closely with key local influences to sell the Vans story and are constantly gathering and assessing local consumer insights to ensure our brand story also resonates with consumers in the region.", "So overall, really solid results representing strong momentum through the first 3 quarters for Vans, momentum we expect to see continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.", "And with that, let's move on to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle", "Global revenues for Timberland were up 2% in the third quarter, right in line with our plans. This result included positive growth in our D2C and wholesale businesses, a balance we're very encouraged by. The work we've done during the past 2 years at Timberland is really paying off.", "In the Americas, we saw revenues up in the mid-single-digit range during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Results in this region were driven by sales of boots in D2C and wholesale as somewhat more seasonal weather began slightly earlier than last year. We continue to see strong results from core and new programs.", "For example, core styles in the premium boots and hiking categories performed really well with our wholesale partners and our own D2C locations. Plus, as you know, we officially relaunched our apparel offering in North American market. Timberland's new rugged and refined apparel is available at select Nordstrom locations, through key specialty independent retailers and at Timberland stores.", "The early reads on the product, particularly in the outerwear category, have been very encouraging. As we mentioned before, we'll take what we've learned from this year's relaunch to shape next year's go-to-market strategy. The collection's early acceptance has us very confident that our current plan has us set in the right direction to achieve our long-term goals.", "We also launched our Best Then. Better Now advertising campaign to coincide with Timberland's fourth -- 40th anniversary of the yellow boot. To kick off the campaign, we invited more than 350 editors, stylists, bloggers and influencers to an interactive style workshop where they got to experience firsthand the new positioning of this iconic brand. We also launched a newly designed homepage for the Timberland brand, which offers an enhanced consumer experience, one that has already nearly doubled the average time consumers spend on the site. And we also launched the When Your Feet Hurt, Your Work Suffers campaign for Timberland PRO, featuring the Hyperion work boot. And speaking of PRO, that collection continues to post consistent gains in this important sector with a mid-teen comp during the quarter.", "We're also pleased to report that our target operational initiatives designed to drive conversion are continuing to take hold, resulting in another quarter of strong growth in the Americas for Timberland's D2C business. In short, we continue to make significant progress with Timberland and remain confident that we have set the right path for stronger long-term growth. We couldn't be more confident in our ability to grow this brand. The product is stellar. Our distribution is well positioned, and we're telling our amazing stories.", "Now let's take a look at Timberland's International business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In line with expectations, revenue in Europe were flat, reflecting a slight increase in our wholesale business, offset by weaker D2C sales where we continue to work on resetting key locations across the continent.", "While overall market conditions have remained relatively soft, our comparisons have continued to improve. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the brand. Similar to the Americas, both core and new categories in Timberland are performing well and our apparel has seeing favorable responses, particularly in bottoms and outerwear.", "We also are celebrating the brand's 40th anniversary as a way to connect consumers to the Timberland story. We participated in Bread and Butter trade show for the first time and showcased our collections and celebrated our anniversary. The event was a great success with almost 3,000 visitors. Through media, we reached an additional 15 million consumers. We're now working to translate this experience to events at stores throughout Europe.", "In Asia, revenues were up 9% in constant dollars, and we saw strong growth across the region in both women's and men's footwear. On the men's side, growth came from the boot category, driven by the 40th anniversary marketing campaign. In women's, classic styles led the way, with the boot category doubling over last year. In addition, women's apparel saw strong results, driven by sweaters and wovens. Overall, we are really placed with our progress in Timberland's International business and have put ourselves in a great position for a strong 2014.", "And with that, I turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. Global Jeanswear posted solid results this quarter with revenues up 4%. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, which included a high single-digit increase in the mass channel, along with strong results in Europe. Q3 was also a highly profitable quarter for Jeanswear, posting a 21.2% operating margin. This strong profitability was due primarily to gross margin improvements and some favorable mix shifts.", "Third quarter global revenues for Wrangler were up 8%, driven by strong results in Europe and a high single-digit increase in our Americas region. We remain sharply focused on conveying the Wrangler message of innovation, authenticity and value to our consumers to enhance the way we engage with the brand.", "During the quarter, we launched 2 new ad campaigns that aim to do just that. Drew Brees, Brett Favre and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. are now featured in ads shown during NFL and NCAA broadcasts. So great connection points into the heart of that consumer. We've also just finalized a campaign aimed at Hispanic consumers that will launch during the fourth quarter.", "We saw solid results in our Western business, driven by momentum in our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut Jeans. The initial sell-throughs of our new Premium Performance Cowboy Cut with advanced comfort has exceed our expectations. We're also working with our innovation team on a pipeline to develop and implement solutions for the Western consumers' needs. We know this is a very important and growing consumer segment for us, so we are creating more innovative products to give them what they want, when they want it.", "Of note, we recently launched a comprehensive new Wrangler Patch campaign, featuring our advanced comfort products featuring Trevor Brazile, the #1 ranked cowboy in the PRCA. Our Americas non-U.S. business continued to be one of the fastest-growing regions for the Wrangler brand, posting solid growth during the quarter with revenues up at a high-single digit constant dollar rate with particular strength in Latin America. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "It's been a while since I've been able to say this, so I'll treasure it a bit. Our Wrangler business in Europe was up about 10% in constant dollars compared with last year with [ph] improvement in profitability that contributed strongly to the overall global Jeanswear results. We are seeing improved sell-through in our product, driven by our focus on denim performance. Specifically, consumers are responding well to our water-resistant fabrics and multi-pocket functionality. And we continue to experience strength in Germany, Poland and Russia, some of our key markets in Europe.", "Now back to Scott with Lee.", "Scott H. Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. The Lee brand grew 3% on a global basis in the third quarter. Revenues in the Americas region grew at a mid-single-digit range with balanced growth across all channels. Our strong revenue growth was driven by a combination of new product launches and our new fall marketing campaign. We've also made several strategic enhancements to lease in-store visual presentation, which makes it easier for consumers to find our attractive new products.", "We are pleased with the early results of our men's casual business, which is being driven by the introduction of our Total Freedom pant. Based on early selling, this pant is being expanded to 340 additional doors this fall. And taking advantage of what appears to be an emerging casual pant trend, we've begun testing the Weekend Chino across most accounts in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to our department store business. Our Lee Platinum label products continue to grow and are now available at nearly 400 key department store locations and a major test coming with another retailer partner this fall.", "The Slender Secret jean and the Monaco trouser have been real standout performers for us. Early sales results are quite strong and these programs will be expanded in 2014. We are definitely excited to see increasing momentum in this brand as we welcome more consumers to the Lee story.", "Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Lee's International business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In Europe, Lee men revenues were up at the low single-digit rate in constant dollars with strength in Northern Europe. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our new Stretch Deluxe women's product, as well as in the performance of our overall women's category. In addition, we have enhanced our marketing efforts to drive more traffic in targeted regions and around specific channels. Sales of our new men's collection, Blue Label, continue to exceed our expectations as customers respond favorably to the product's outstanding fit and comfort.", "In Asia, sequentially, our results continue to improve and our gross margin benefited from lower product costs, which led to improved profits. And in line with expectations, we have continued to make progress against a wholesale denim inventory overhang that has affected the denim category in China, and we expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter.", "Our Fall/Winter Collection has received a positive response, particularly the premium Stretch Deluxe women's product, as well as the Urban Riders line. In China and India, we recently launched our first sustainability program, E Think [ph], with an environmentally friendly and fashionable product collection. We are confident that we're in the right track with this business and that we'll see healthy growth once inventory levels return to normal.", "Now here's Bob to take you through our financial highlights.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Thanks, KH. Well, all in all, I'd say we delivered a really solid third quarter, particularly in light of an environment that's not exactly robust. How do we do it? A powerful brand portfolio, a highly effective strategy focused on innovation and consumer connectivity, strong platforms, and of course, outstanding execution on the part of our passionate team around the world.", "Let's take a look at how we did. Total VF revenue grew 5% in the third quarter or 4% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. As Eric mentioned, the retailer calendar shift negatively impacted these growth rates by 2 percentage points. On a regional basis, revenues in the U.S. were up 3% with growth in both the Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale channels. Total International revenues were up 7%, driven by 13% growth in the Americas, now that's the non-U.S. region; a 7% increase in European revenues, where the economic environment remains challenging; and 2% growth in the Asia Pacific region where China was up 10%.", "Our Direct-to-Consumer business had another great quarter with revenues up 14% and strong performances from The North Face, Vans, Nautica, Kipling and Napapijri brands. We continue to be really pleased with the contribution our D2C business mix, both in terms of sales and earnings. We're adding more stores. Our profitability is improving, and the earnings per share contribution continues to grow substantially from this business. And we expect that momentum to continue with even greater growth and positive results from nearly every brand in our portfolio during the fourth quarter.", "Now let's take a look at our gross margin performance. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 47.6%. That's a 90-basis-point improvement over last year. The drivers of this improvement are the same, a continued favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses with some additional contribution from lower product costs. And in line with year-to-date trend, we saw gross margin improvement in almost every business, which I'd say is quite impressive, especially given the environment in many parts of the world. Indeed, a big accomplishment.", "Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues rose 40 basis points to 30% in the third quarter. And as you saw in the release, our marketing spend rose by 80 basis points in the quarter. That implies we're seeing leverage elsewhere in our expense structure, and this is really an important point. Our management teams have done a great job of controlling expenses, which is allowing us to make substantial investments behind our brands around the globe. And as we've proven numerous times in the past, that's provided us with a lot of momentum going into the following year.", "In fact, with the incremental marketing investment that we just announced, the ratio of our marketing spend to revenues will increase to 6% in 2013, clearly an all-time high for us, and in this environment, precisely the right thing to do. In terms of dollars, our marketing spend will now increase by about $100 million in 2013 over 2012.", "An incremental expense started in the third quarter with significantly more coming in the fourth. During the third quarter, we invested about $10 million more in marketing than we previously planned with a heavy focus supporting our D2C businesses. In the fourth quarter, we have approved plans to spend an additional $30 million in these incremental marketing investments.", "So all in, during the second half of 2013, we intend to spend about $40 million, worth about $0.25 a share, more than was originally planned to support our highest growth businesses. With a focus on The North Face, Vans and Timberland, 80% of the spend is in Outdoor & Action Sports. And about 70% positioned outside the U.S. and heavily D2C weighted, we're confident this will be money well spent.", "Let's move on to operating margin, which improved 50 basis points to 17.6%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and underlying expense control. Keep in mind that the incremental marketing investment that I just discussed impacted the quarter by about 30 basis points. Taking this down to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $3.91 from $3.52 in last year's same period.", "Now let's take a look at our coalition results, starting with our largest contributor to growth, Outdoor & Action Sports, which reached 60% of VF's total sales in the quarter. Total revenues grew 6%, which was in line with expectations and driven primarily by Vans, along with positive performances from nearly all brands in the coalition. The North Face, also in line with expectations, was up 3%. D2C was up more than 25%, while the wholesale business was essentially flat.", "Now as you may recall from our second quarter comments, we said that the revenue cadence for The North Face in the second half will look at bit different than what you've seen in the past. Retailer caution was expected to push out what would have been third quarter orders into the fourth quarter. That, coupled with the retail calendar shift, which moved what normally would have been September shipments into October, resulted in our expectations of low single-digit growth in the third quarter. And that's exactly what we delivered. If you take the retailer calendar shift out of the equation, The North Face would have been up at a high single-digit rate. And taking that one step further, overall Outdoor & Action Sports -- outdoor sports revenues would have been up 8% versus the 6% reported.", "Operating income for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, and operating margin declined 90 basis points to 21.4%. Now putting that into perspective, the $40 million shift in revenues and the high gross margins that would have been attached to that, along with the incremental marketing investments, had quite an impact on the reported results of the coalition in the quarter. Of course, this coalition's fourth quarter will clearly benefit from the calendar shift.", "Jeanswear posted a great quarter with revenues up 4%, driven by strength in the Americas and European regions, while revenues in the Asia Pacific region were down as we continue to work through higher inventories for the Lee brand. Now putting up some great revenue numbers where our Jeanswear folks really hit it out of the park was in profitability. Strong international performance, along with some lower product costs, drove a 20% increase in operating income, resulting in a 21.2% operating margin. And that improvement was in both Wrangler and Lee and across all of our regions. All in all, a really nice quarter for our Jeanswear folks.", "Next up is Imagewear where revenues were flat versus last year. Now while the comparisons in Imagewear remain challenged due to softness in certain parts of the business, we are looking forward to a much stronger fourth quarter when we expect low double-digit revenue growth. The good news is operating margin in the third quarter increased 110 basis points to 14.3%, driven by improved gross margin due to lower product costs.", "Now on to Sportswear. Revenues were up 1%, which was in line with our expectations. D2C was up more than 25% and offset by a mid-teen percentage decline in wholesale sales as a result of the same retail calendar shift we talked about for The North Face. Excluding this shift, revenues would have been up at a high-single digit rate.", "Kipling delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with global revenue growth of 22%, with the U.S. business being up nearly 40%. And taking a look at profitability, we're very pleased to have achieved operating income growth of 30% and operating margin expansion of 350 basis points to 15.5%.", "Our Sportswear team is headed for one terrific year. And finally, revenues for our Contemporary Brands coalition were up 1% in the quarter to $105 million. The softness in our Contemporary Brands business is primarily attributable to continued weakness in premium denim in the high-end department store channel. Operating income fell 30% to $9 million in the third quarter, and operating margin fell 390 basis points to 9%.", "Now moving along to some balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Over the years, we have consistently demonstrated highly disciplined inventory management, and the third quarter is no exception. In fact, our inventories were flat to last year despite our revenue gains, reflecting our ongoing commitment to operational excellence.", "In other good news, our pension plan is now nearly fully funded, and with respect to cash from operations, we remain on track to exceed $1.4 billion in 2013. We also paid off $400 million in debt associated with the Timberland acquisition. And to that point, our debt ratio is now in line with pre-Timberland numbers. As I said last quarter, we expect to be fully out of commercial paper by the end of the year. All of this points to a very healthy balance sheet and one that is ready to support future investment.", "And as detailed in the press releases that went out today, our Board of Directors approved a 4-for-1 split of common stock payable in the form of a stock dividend. Why the decision to split our stock? Two things really: our consistent strong financial performance and our confidence in that continuing; and the desire to make the shares attractive to a broader range of investors.", "", "And of course, I have to comment on our dividend. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share, which is an $0.18 or 21% increase over last quarter. This represents the 41st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend, something we are very proud of and that shows our commitment to our shareholders. 41 years, it's pretty rare, for sure.", "So let's cap things off with some comments on our full year outlook. Revenues should still approximate $11.5 billion, a bit of rounding that may very well come down to the wire. We're looking forward to a very strong fourth quarter with revenue gains that should approximate 10%. The quarter will benefit from the retail calendar shift that I previously discussed, as well as this year's new store openings and expectations for a very strong e-com performance.", "And also, I have to comment on our gross margin. With the very strong results achieved in the first 9 months of 2013, we're now looking for our full year gross margin to approach 48%, up approximately 150 basis points over 2012. That means in year 1 of our 5-year plan, we've made huge progress against our target of 49.5% by 2017, which takes us to the bottom line. Given the significance of the $40 million incremental marketing spend, which is worth $0.25 per share, we're pleased to report that we can invest for the future and still achieve our long-term earnings growth target of 13%.", "So in closing, VF is headed for another terrific year in 2013. Our operating performance is strong. We're investing in our brands to ensure future growth. We're able to provide our shareholders significant returns through yet another meaningful increase in our dividend. And as well, the 4-for-1 stock split reflects the confidence we have in our future.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I've got no additional comments. I know you have questions, so let's get to that session, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So, Bob, you mentioned the outdoor coalition EBIT margins in the quarter. They were a little bit lower. Can you just clarify for me, excluding the shift that we saw on the wholesale side with margins a bit higher, and will we be back to positive territory on the margins there when you pick up that shift in the fourth quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Michael, there were 2 things. Number one, almost all of the $10 million of the incremental investment was in Outdoor & Action Sports, almost every single dollar of it. So that's one thing, right, so that would have gone right to the bottom line. And in addition to that, the shift, the shift in revenues, as you can imagine, we lost all of that gross margin, right, in the quarter. And our expense structure, the SG&A structure, for example, would have changed very, very little. So all of that gross margin, pretty much all of the gross margin would have flowed through in the quarter, so it would have made a very, very different -- a very different picture for the quarter. So sure, when we get those gross margins into the fourth quarter, it will look differently than it did in the third.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And, Bob, you also said that -- I think you said on the third quarter, around the last conference call, that third quarter gross margin increase would be less of an increase than fourth quarter. But I think the guidance implies it to be a little bit high -- I'm sorry, a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Now is there anything that's changed in the formula? Maybe you can give us a little bit of how you're thinking about the change in the formula in the third quarter -- fourth quarter versus what you're thinking last quarter?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Michael, really not a lot different. The -- yes, the gains in both quarters, at this point in time, look to be -- look to actually be pretty similar. So the third quarter was a little bit stronger than we anticipated. And right now, if you do the math, it says that the fourth quarter is going to be slightly above the 48% level, so we're going to see the gain there as well, and it's driven mostly by the mix shift that we've been seeing pretty consistently.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Can you talk about some of the changes underway and progress at North Face and making the brand a bit more transitional, less winter focused? And how are some of your retail partners adjusting? What's the best way to think about the order flow going forward as we get into next year?", "Steven E. Rendle", "We think the shift that we see taking place at The North Face, we've talked about in some of the calls here in the past, and it starts first with the activity-based model, which really came online a little over 4 years ago, where we moved the brand into an expanded set of activities and, with that, an expanded focus on some new incremental categories. This shift was very focused on moving the brand to more of a fourth quarter brand. And as we said, it really lines up well with how we've seen these last 2 warm winters. As we have gone into spring selling with 2 new collections, we've seen this strategy really take hold. We'll be launching a new training apparel collection within our performance activity under the name of Mountain Athletic. That has been received extremely well by our retail partners and also supported by our Ultra Protection footwear collection, where there is both training as well as light hiking and hiking footwear, again, coming out of that focus of the activity-based model. So feeling very strong about how we're evolving the brand through this new perspective, and these are trends that we've seen, coming out of 2013, we think give us great momentum into 2014.", "Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then Timberland's revenue performance seems to be inflecting mid-single digits in the Americas. Can you talk about progress there and how you're thinking about that brand into next year and, also, opportunity on the margin side with Timberland?", "Steven E. Rendle", "Yes, so why don't I start with that, answering this question, and I'll past it over to Karl Heinz. So in the Americas, as we mentioned here in the notes, we've seen really good performance with our footwear business, specifically boots in light hiking and many of the new casual styles in Q3, giving us really great confidence that the work done over the past 2 years is right on track. The relaunch of apparel here in the U.S. market, early reads, specifically with our outerwear, is giving us really good confidence that we've got the right vision for this strategy. And most importantly, what this is showing us is that we're on track to shift the perspective of that American consumer to think of Timberland more of a lifestyle brand versus what has been historically a boot brand. So really, really confident and excited about the momentum we have coming out of '13 into '14.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "So this is KH. Starting with Europe, I think the good news is we see it coming also. We had a couple of tough quarters at the beginning of the year. We are flat this quarter, and we expect growth in the Q4. So the brand has, for sure, momentum. We have some work to do, but we see it coming. Also, the spring indications we have are very positive. Asia continues simply to grow. We always had consistent growth in Asia. It's a very strong retail model there, health is apparent, so it's a good picture there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple questions. Can you speak to the spring backlog for the forward order businesses? And then secondly, the Jeanswear operating profit has carried a pretty heavy load through the first 3 quarters. Bob, could you speak to the prospects for Jeanswear margins going forward and your thoughts on the coalition mix, to contribution to profit?", "Steven E. Rendle", "So, Jim, on the spring backlog for next year, we stopped quantifying our order books for The North Face about a year ago, so we really aren't prepared to comment on that. What I can tell you, though, at this point, the momentum, we've talked about coming out of Q3 into Q4, the positive reception of these new collections, Mountain Athletic, the Ultra Protection footwear and some of the new equipment products that we are selling into the market, really confident and are in line with our long-term plans and expectations.", "Robert K. Shearer", "And, Jim, I'll speak to the Jeanswear piece. Yes, the third quarter -- you're right, the third quarter Jeanswear numbers, and particularly the profitability, was a little stronger than we had anticipated, and it's driven by a couple things. One, the gross margin was a little bit better than we thought but -- in particular, the European business. Karl Heinz mentioned that he hadn't had a chance to mention that for a little while. But the European jeans business really, really had a nice -- had a very, very strong quarter for us, and that helped us. In terms of -- I think your question, Jim, was as we look at the fourth quarter and in terms of the overall profitability and mix for Jeanswear, specifically for Jeanswear, that the improvement will start to flatten out a little bit, although we do expect some expansion in the fourth quarter. And we expect also margin expansion in some of the other businesses where we've been seeing that today, and then we saw it in the third quarter, for example, in Imagewear, Sportswear as well, and Contemporary. So that's how the year will shake out.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions. First, I was hoping you could give us a little more color, broadly speaking, on what's going on in China. It looks like Vans maybe slowed down versus previous trends, just looking at the APAC up only high-single digits. And then Lee, you're now expecting a return to growth in the fourth quarter, but is there a sustainable improvement that you see in the Jeanswear business happening in China? And then maybe just a little more on the Timberland outlook and maybe just some broad color on what exactly you guys are seeing going on in the consumer market over there. And then the second question is, if we could get a little more detail on the marketing investments. You mentioned the TV in China. I understand the focus on Europe in the key brands. But is it TV and print in Europe? Or what -- maybe a little more color on what you guys are going to be doing in the fourth quarter.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "So, Robbie, I'll get us started a little bit on this. The first question, I think, was what's going on in China, and it's pretty widely publicized that the Chinese market, while it has slowed down overall in apparel and footwear, it's still the fastest-growing consumer market in the world for apparel and footwear. And our third quarter is -- we had a couple unusual things going on with the timing of shipments in the North Face. And the Lee question that you asked really gets to an inventory build that we've talked about before, and the denim category in total in China, that the industry is working through an inventory glut, and we said that we'd expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter, but that's just the beginning. The good news is that consumer takeaway in the specialty stores where we sell Lee jeans has still been strong. It just -- we came into the year with a big inventory build. Timberland in Asia, as Karl Heinz just said, continues to be strong. That business has been on a growth track. It is based primarily in Japan, and we've had some currency translation issues in our reported results. But we continue to grow and have expansion opportunities throughout the Asian region. And on to the marketing investments, it's $40 million. The really good news is when you commit late in the year to increase your marketing, it's all going to go against the consumer. We're not creating new ads, there's no production costs, the spend is really just increasing our voice. So for example, with The North Face in China, as Karl Heinz mentioned, we've more than doubled our investment there in The North Face. We originally planned to do some TV in just a few markets. With this additional investment, we've doubled the number of markets that we're going to be doing local TV advertising, and we've added a significant national TV advertising campaign that will reach everywhere in China. So it's all spent directly against the consumer. And there is a mix between what's being spent online and digitally versus TV and print, but I don't have those details for you, Karl Heinz has one other point.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, I just want to -- I didn't cover it all, but I think you have a specific question on Vans in China. You picked up relatively slow growth in Q3, this is true, but there was some timing involved. You might recall, last year, we reported explosive growth in Australia. We got a big order from a distributor there. And it's just a timing issue. So Vans will be going back to growth -- strong double-digit growth in Q4, as it had been in Q1 and Q2.", "Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And, Karl Heinz, the 25% Vans growth in Europe, how sustainable does that look?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, you heard us saying in the past, we reported the growth on Vans, which was substantially higher, right, 40%, 50% in the past calls, that was high. We have now a business model where we believe the 20% is sustainable for the following reason. We started Vans with high initiatives, with high marketing initiatives in one specific market, which is the U.K., where we reached a great success. From there then, we moved on in other countries with a little bit less risks, so Germany, France, Italy would be great examples and Scandinavia. So we still have a long way to go in terms of penetration and market size. Our competitor there is also bigger than us. So we still see opportunities going forward with Vans.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "On your dividend, with the balance sheet in such good shape and your debt ratio back down below Timberland levels and your explicit target to get to 40% payout ratio just sort of rolling up your algorithm earnings growth we're still easily below that, can you talk about how you think about the timing to get to 40% payout and why not up the dividend a little bit more?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, I'll start on that. The -- in our 2017 plan, what we indicated there was that we would work back up to the 40% by that point in time. It's just something that we'll constantly evaluate. We'll be at about 34% in 2013, and with our plans, we'll move that up a couple -- 2 or 3 percentage points each year is what we would plan to do. And we're still -- we remain very acquisition-minded, it's always the trade-off, and looking at all the pieces and balancing all the pieces to the right level. So once again, if we're not seeing acquisitions flow through, we'll look at a number of different things in the past. We've upped our buyback program, if it made sense to do so. What we've been pretty consistent in saying is what we're not looking to do is stockpile a lot of cash in the balance sheet. So we will put it to work in the most effective means that we determine as we go forward. So sure, we'll look at changing that dividend payout or even increasing it based on all other factors.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And given the volatility we've seen in the consumer backdrop, are you feeling any better or worse about the pipeline of acquisition opportunities out there?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I don't think we're feeling better or worse. The honest truth is after we acquired Timberland just over 2 years ago, we took a good year, 1.5 years off and focused on creating the value that we promised through Timberland. And as you see in our results, from an earnings per share contribution basis, Timberland is running ahead of schedule. So thrilled with that, feel like we have Timberland moving in exactly the direction we want it to move, and then we're very proud of the work that team is doing. And now we're looking again. But it is bumpy. They tend to come in waves, and we're always looking for the next opportunity. And I can't think of a week that's gone by when we haven't had a discussion at one level or another about businesses that we'd like to have join our company, but I can't say anything more specific than that.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your comfort level with inventories at retail and your expectations for order patterns over the course of the quarter from your customers.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "I'll take a shot at that. It's Eric here, Christian. We've talked about, particularly in the -- using the Outdoor industry as an example, the industry has approached this season very cautiously, and that means that they've bought conservatively because the last 2 winters have been so difficult. So we think it's hard to generalize for global company with 30 brands, but if there was a generalization, it would be that the inventories at retail are in pretty good shape, with the one exception of the denim -- being the denim category, jeans category in China. Other than that, we don't see any issues. And we are positioned to respond to an increase in demand. Our inventories are really clean, right? We ended the quarter with inventories flat on last year, and the math would suggest we're going to grow around 10% in the fourth quarter, and we're starting with flat inventories. So our inventories are clean, and we think the retailers are pretty clean as well, in general.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "With regards to the marketing spend, can you walk us through how soon you saw results from the higher marketing spend when you increased this a year ago and then also 3 years ago? I would assume that one of the objectives of increasing marketing spending in Europe is similar to what you did in the U.S. 3 years ago.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Kate, it is similar. And the way we look at it is that it's certainly -- we do believe that it will help sell-throughs in the current year. But we believe that most of the benefit would be a next year type of thing. So we look at these as a little bit longer term. We -- as we thought about making these investments, we thought a lot about our -- the plans that we laid out for 2017 and the growth rates over that period of time and what it took to achieve those. So that was really the driving force -- rate driving force in terms of making these investments, so a little bit longer-term view. But -- so again, specifically to your question, I think I'd say that we'll see more benefit in 2014 than we might in 2013.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And part of the benefit, I know, to gross margins was lower product costs. Will you see a similar level of that impacting Q4 gross margins as you did in Q3?", "Robert K. Shearer", "In the third quarter, of the 90 basis points, 50 was mix. So once again, as we've been saying, very, very consistently, we see that mix somewhere in the 50- to 70-basis-point range. And so that implies in the third quarter there was about 40 basis points of improvement coming from cost reductions. As we look to the fourth quarter, so once again, we're looking at about 60 to 70 basis points of improvement, that's what the math implies in our gross margin, and most of that will be driven by mix. Not quite the same level coming from costs, but there may be maybe 10 or 20 basis points versus the 40 that we saw in the third quarter, so a little bit less, and the mix -- though the mix benefit will hold.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I guess if I could -- you talked a lot about China broadly and some on Vans. I guess back to North Face, Eric, I think you started to say a little bit of a timing shift there in 3Q, but just wanted to get a little more color there because it does seem to have moderated a bit. And given the stepped-up sort of marketing spend, is there anything sort of structural going on in the region there that we should be thinking about or just more of a timing issue?", "Eric C. Wiseman", "No, Eric, it was purely a timing issue. We will get back to growth in the 20% range in the fourth quarter. And The North Face in China was the single biggest investment that we're making. Within the $40 million, The North Face brand in China is our single biggest investment. We have unbelievably low awareness in China and an unbelievably big opportunity, and we hope to move the needle on awareness and sell-through this winter to set us up for a great 2014 in China.", "Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then -- and I guess, Bob, following on, on the gross margin, obviously, a lot of sort of structure levers here at work given the mix shift towards higher-margin D2C international. Anything that really -- potential headwinds going into '14 that potentially somewhat mute that? Anything, be it currency, be it structural, that we should be thinking about?", "Robert K. Shearer", "No, not really. We've been pretty consistent in saying that it does feel that we're at a point where we've seen some cost increases and we would expect some level of cost increase then in -- as we look at 2014, and we'll have a lot more to say about that. But no, relative to our story, as I said in my comments, we made huge improvement this year towards that 49.5% goal in 2017, kind of halfway there, actually, in this 1 year. And we continue to expect that we'll move forward towards that 49.5%, and mix will clearly be a significant piece. And relative to any cost increases, with the strength of our brands, we're in a great position to offset those challenges with pricing. So we'll have a lot more to say about that as -- in February.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple things. I don't mean to beat gross margin with -- up too much here. I'm just -- on Q4, Bob -- Q3 mix was a 50-basis-point benefit. Q4, I mean, in theory, shouldn't mix be a greater benefit? You've got shifts in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition that are more favorable in Q4 than Q3. And then I think to your point, you're looking for 10% revenue growth in Q4 and a lot of that coming from D2C, which is, obviously, a high-margin business. So when you guys are saying 50 basis points of mix benefit in Q4, is that just you guys being conservative? It seems like in theory, mix should do more for you there.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Well, we said -- so we said 50 basis points in third quarter, and yes, there's 50 to 60 basis points of -- coming from mix in the fourth quarter. And then filling in the gaps there, we're looking for 60 to 70 basis points, once again, that's what the math would imply, so 10 to 20 basis points coming from costs. So yes, Mitch, you're right, it should be a little stronger on the mix side, and it will be.", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on kind of Q4 assumption, you guys mentioned some things on the last call, I just want to be clear that you guys are still looking kind of for the same items. I think last quarter, I think, Eric, you had mentioned that you're looking for sort of modestly or planning for modestly better weather in North America versus last year. And I think specifically, I think Steve mentioned reorders on The North Face up high-single digits, and I can't remember who said this, but I think you're seeing sort of global comp up high-single digits in the back half, and I'm wondering if you can just say what that was in Q3 and kind of what your Q4 outlook for comp is. I just want to go down on some of the assumptions to kind of get to Q4 guidance.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "Yes, we're not really -- we don't really give guidance -- comp store guidance, Mitch. But I'll -- let me try to help you some. If you look at our fourth quarter and you do the math, it says that we need to grow about 10% in the fourth quarter to hit the number. Now remember, we had a 2% shift out of the third quarter into the fourth. So you back that up and there's been a -- you start with -- so how does that compare to the third quarter? The third quarter, we were up 5%. And you add 2% to that, you're 7%. So what we're looking for, 1-percentage-point improvement, and that should come. We're going into the quarter with 100 more doors, owned and operated doors, than we had this time last year. Our e-commerce business is our fastest-growing business. And we're spending a lot of money to drive product through our wholesale customers. So all of that, plus a modestly better winter, we're not -- our guidance, as we said all year long, we assumed a more normal winter. We did not assume a blizzard winter. That's really a U.S. discussion because Europe had a good winter last year. Does that give you enough helpful color?", "Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate that.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin outlook. I'm wondering if you can just help us understand the puts and takes into 2014. Would you expect some of the mix benefits that you're seeing this year to continue into 2014? And then secondarily, on the cost side, it sounds like you're starting to see some slight increases in cost on 2014 orders. Is that coming in labor, materials, both? If you could just help us understand that, that would be great.", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, Kimberly, we'll be really happy to lay all that out for you in February in terms of the puts and takes for 2014, but it's just -- it's too early for us to do that at this point in time. And you're right, so I did mention, I think, in terms of VF Corporation, and our competitors would say that it looks like there's some cost pressure coming at us in 2014. We're still working through that. Frankly, a lot of that is going to have to do with the supply and demand rule is always at play in terms of what we'll ultimately pay for, for products. So yes, the cost increases are coming a little bit across the board. There's some in fabrics, there's some just in our overall source costs impacted by labor. So there are a number of factors, I'd say, that will probably impact that, but we'll have a lot more to say about that when we talk about 2014 in February.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "But, Kimberly, you are right in your assumption about -- when we laid out our 2017 plan, we said that our growth getting to $17 billion would come disproportionately from growth in our International business, growth in our direct-to-consumer business and growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, all of which have higher margins. And we've talked about that contributing somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 basis points, so I think, Bob, too, annually, over time, and how we're going to get there?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Yes, that's right.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "And we're not changing that outlook for the future.", "Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Terrific. That's very helpful. And I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on Asia with the 2% growth here this quarter. Obviously, China, at high-single digits, is quite good. But is Jeanswear the business that's holding down the Asia growth or is there something else going on there?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Kimberly, this is KH here. You're right, we had this year our weakest quarter. We had Q1 and Q2, which were up double-digit. And we expect Q4 to be again up double-digit. Actually, it would become our strongest quarter. You said it right, we had issues with jeans, which I did say in my script we expect the overhang to be finished and be positive again in Q4. We had also some issues with currency. Timberland's biggest market is Japan, and we had some pressure with the yen. And a similar thing happened in India with the rupee. So I would say there was more extraordinary noise, and we still see big and great opportunities in China.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Kernan with Cowen and Company.", "John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "A lot of my questions have been answered, but I was just wondering from a strategic perspective and given all the cash that could potentially be on the balance sheet next year and your leverage ratios coming down, would you potentially look outside the U.S. for an acquisition? I mean, historically, I think most of your acquisitions have been U.S.-based brands, but would you look to Europe and Asia for potentially acquiring a brand as well?", "Robert K. Shearer", "Sure, John. Yes, and we have in the past. So the answer to that question would be yes. Certainly, yes. In terms -- and particularly, I'd say, probably a little more Europe than Asia at this point in time, possibly Asia down the road, but at this point, Europe. So sure, we look for brands that ideally we could take across the globe, but also we've looked for brands that have been primarily centered in a region like Europe. And if we can grow them across Europe and get the kind of returns that we and our shareholders are looking for, we would certainly entertain that as a possibility.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And, John, Napa and Kipling are 2 great examples. We rarely talk about this brand, but I think we did mention Kipling lately, it was the fastest-growing brand in sight we have for 2 quarters. So we're very happy with that performance.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "A lot of them have been answered, but Karl Heinz, I was hoping if you could just maybe comment on how you're feeling about the health of the consumer in Europe right now and maybe just parse it out between Northern and Southern Europe. And then secondly, as it relates that you mentioned briefly the Bread & Butter show and your Timberland brand being showcased there, if you could just speak a little bit more about kind of the appetite -- or the increasing appetite for that brand. Are you seeing kind of new accounts that were being drawn towards the brand or just current accounts going deeper within the product offering?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you for the question. So let's start with the first part, right, the sentiment in Europe. There's no big changes, I would say, in Europe. There are couple of big indicators showing. We are slowly going the right direction, which is good. But I wouldn't say -- there's no radical change to our last call. Having said that, we act to the portfolio of brands, and we act geographically in different areas, so we are clearly using that. And we are pushing where we see bigger opportunities. Emerging market in Europe, which is basically Russia down to Turkey, is a big opportunity, but so are the larger ones like German, Austria, Switzerland, that block. So I would say all in all, no big change, but we are doing pretty well with our brands. Specifically Bread & Butter and Timberland, this was our first time we went to that show with Timberland. We did go with other brands there in the past. Timberland was the first time. I think the response was shockingly strong for us. We did not expect such a response. In terms of participation, we had 3,000 people at the booth, which normally it doesn't happen. But we also did some additional activities around the 40-years history of Timberland. And to make it short, we see Timberland coming in Europe. I said that in the script, we expect Q4 to be positive, first time this year. The sellout data we see are good, especially in footwear, men's footwear, but also on apparel. So all in all, we see the brand coming, and we expect a great 2014.", "Eric C. Wiseman", "If that concludes our questions, I'll close with a quick comment.", "We're focused right now on execution around our holiday season. It's a big season for us. And we're very focused, while investing more in our big brands, to create momentum as we approach 2014. We'll give you the wrap-up of all that on Valentine's Day. Looking forward to talking to you then when we talk about our fourth quarter performance and our 2014 plans. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lance Allega. Please go ahead.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone joining us today to discuss VF's first quarter 2014 results. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Participants may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release which was issued at 7 am Eastern Time and also at the vfc.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO, and VF executives Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.", "Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions and ask that you please limit your questions to two per caller. Thanks.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate more than just our solid performance over the last three months. They show the value of how we build our business and how we've executed against our growth strategy during the last three years.", "By consistently leveraging our powerful brand portfolio and our business platforms, we continue to create and transform the market to outperform the industry and position VF for consistent long-term growth. 2014 is off to a great start.", "So let's dive right in with the top line. Total first quarter revenues were up 6.5% driven by continued strong momentum in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Of note, that coalition grew at a faster rate in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year with revenues up 14% versus 12%. The three largest brands; the North Face, Vans and Timberland all posted outstanding results with strong double-digit growth in each.", "Our international business was up 11% and included double-digit growth in both Europe and our Asia Pacific regions. And our direct-to-consumer business grew 16% with double-digit growth in both our U.S. and our international business. Combined, this performance translated to a 130 basis point gross margin expansion lifting us to 49.4% in the quarter including improvements in all five of our coalitions.", "First quarter operating margin reached 14.5%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year and our earnings per share increased 12% to $0.67. So overall, we're very pleased with the strong momentum in our business and what is setting up to be another record year for VF. And given our first quarter results, we now expect revenues to increase to the upper end of our previously guided 7% to 8% range, so nearly 8%.", "Supporting this higher growth was an increase in our expectations for Outdoor & Action Sports coalition which we now expect to be 12% to 13% higher than last year's already strong results. Additionally, we now expect earnings per share of $3.06 which represents 13% growth over 2013's results. With a great start to 2014 and our outlook for the full year, we are squarely on track to achieve the goals outlined in our 2017 plan.", "While the past few years have revealed many changes in the world from macroeconomic challenges to consumer trends to a changing retail environment, that dynamic operating environment has highlighted the considerable strength of VF's powerful brands and powerful platforms.", "Our ability to deliver consistent, sustainable financial performance remains grounded in the cornerstones of our growth strategy; leading innovation, connecting with consumers, serving consumers directly and expanding geographically. When we deliver on each of these in concert, VF is at its best. As I look out across the balance of the year, I can say that I've never been more confident about the potential in front of us.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott to take us through our five largest brands and then Bob will go through our financial results. Steve, over to you.", "Steve Rendle", "Thanks, Eric. Starting with the North Face, industry-leading product innovations and amplified marketing efforts continue to build on the fantastic momentum we saw at the end of 2013. In fact, not only did it carry over but it accelerated to drive 14% global revenue growth for the North Face in the first quarter.", "The America's business showed great strength posting a high teen increase in revenues led by successes in both winter and spring products. Product highlights like Thermoball and our premium Steep Series line saw consistent strength over the winter season. And as we made the transition into spring, Thermoball which is engineered as a transitional-weight product remains quite strong along with the spring '14 launch of our ultra performance footwear collection and the mountain athletic training line, which are driving continued momentum and further validating our expansion into a four season brand.", "Looking out towards fall '14, we continue to have great product stories from significant expansions in Thermoball styles, in the mountain athletics collection to the launch of our new Quantum outdoor training collection and the debut of FuseForm in our Steep Series line, 2014 will be one of the strongest product offerings in TNF's history. To support all this, our targeted brand level campaigns like Mountains are Calling and the Explorer have created significant social media momentum and driven the highest TNF brand equity scores we've ever posted.", "In our retail stores and online, we're focused on telling big stories through curated assortment amplified by visual merchandising and superior customer service. To wrap it up, the first quarter in the Americas was a success. Inventories in both the D2C and wholesale channels are in great shape and with amazing product on deck and solid booking in hand for this coming fall, we have great confidence in our ability to deliver 12% global growth for the North Face in 2014.", "Now here's Karl Heinz to run through Europe and Asia.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, the North Face saw a low single-digit increase in revenues in the first quarter, which given a much warmer than normal winter, we consider a solid result. DTC revenues were up at the mid teen rate including more than 30% growth in online sales. So we did see some strength in a somewhat challenging market, but perhaps most importantly I have great confidence that we remain ideally positioned in the European outdoor industry.", "On the product front, we continue to make significant progress on transitioning apparel to the European fit as well as greater expansion of our snow sports and activity inspired categories to better meet local demand. These are important initiatives that will help the North Face create an even greater connection with our consumers' active lifestyles.", "Turning to Asia. We saw a mid teen increase in revenues during the quarter with significant DTC strength. In China, the brand was also up at the mid teen rate. We continue to build brand awareness and engage consumers and recently (indiscernible) we campaigned in China to build off the strong momentum that we gained from our advertising campaign last fall. With a solid start to the year, 2014 should see another record year for the North Face in the region.", "Now let's move on to Vans.", "Steve Rendle", "Global revenue for Vans in the first quarter was up 20% with similar growth in both wholesale and D2C businesses, another phenomenal performance by the Vans' team and the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenues in the Americas region were up at a low teen rate, driven by balanced strength in both our D2C and wholesale channels.", "On the product front in the Americas, there are several exciting things happening in footwear including a great response in our women's business, particularly in Slip-ons in both sell-in and sell-through. Additionally in classics, we have seen great success with our collaboration product including our Beatles collection which coincided with the 50th anniversary of their appearance on Ed Sullivan.", "On the technical skate front, the Gilbert Crockett Pro model has been successful elevating the brand into higher price points. We also continued to accelerate our apparel rollout with the re-launch of our women's apparel this spring. 2014 also marks the first year for Vans moving into a four season apparel model with a true summer collection.", "Finally, we launched a new Vans digital platform in late March at vans.com that merges content and commerce in a new and transformative way for our consumers. We've created what is a truly comprehensive and exciting experience for consumers and we're showing both loyal fans and newcomers that they can turn to vans.com to not only connect with the brand but also to stay connected to what's happening in the skate, surf, snow, music, art and street culture. Early reads on the new format in both sales and sentiment have been nothing but positive. All-in-all, Vans Americas posted a great quarter.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "First quarter revenues for Vans Europe were up more than 20% and included D2C growth of more than 40%. As in Americas, we continue to rollout new and innovative ways to connect with consumers and are working to ensure that Vans is synonymous with the youth culture. A great example of this effort is the addition of House of Vans in London which is set to open up in August.", "This location which is similar to the one many of you have been to in New York will bring youth culture together in the heart of the city and provide a unique opportunity for us to engage consumers with an intersection of action, sports, music and art. We are also in a process of redesigning the brand's website in Europe. Our European ecommerce business, although small today, represents a terrific opportunity for significant growth.", "Vans Asian business grew by more than 40% in the first quarter including its China's business which more than doubled. Throughout the region we have seen great success with our collaborations including the Beatles collection which has seen significant sell-through since its launch.", "Our core classic products also continued to do incredibly well in this region. In addition to launching the Living off the Wall brand campaign, we also officially opened the first indoor skate park in Korea which given we have only been in the country for a little more than a year, represents an incredible opportunity to connect with consumers. Globally, a great start to 2014 and we're on track to deliver a mid teen increase in revenues for the full year.", "With that, let's move on to Timberland.", "Steve Rendle", "Carrying the theme forward, Timberland also saw great momentum in the first quarter. Global revenues were up 12% and included balanced strength across channels and geographies. So what's working? Pretty much everything. In fact, based on our strong first quarter results we now expect Timberland to grow 12% in 2014 versus the 10% we discussed in February.", "In the Americas, revenues were up at a high teen percentage rate driven primarily by our wholesale business. Sales of core Timberland men's and kids boot styles as well as our hiking boots almost doubled versus last year. And our Pro line continues to be a game changer in the marketplace led by the Direct Attach collection.", "Four of our top six Timberland product families are now built on the anti-fatigue platform. And we also rolled out our spring collection of apparel during the first quarter and it's off to a very good start. In the first quarter, we also launched the new Bradstreet collection with the SensorFlex technology. Originally inspired by the technologies for trail running, this platform infuses a new level of comfort and shock absorption that we plan to expand across many of our casual products.", "To support the launch, we activated TV ads and retail merchandising displays to communicate a message of comfort and versatility and it's a global effort with more than 1,000 windows that encourage consumers to come in-store to learn more about the innovation. Our efforts are definitely paying off as customers are responding really well to this new product. Overall, we are feeling great about the Timberland business.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's revenues in Europe were up at the high single-digit rate, an indicator of what we anticipate being a consistent growth story throughout the year. We also saw a strong launch for the new Bradstreet collection featuring SensorFlex technology and in particular we saw strong results from our classic footwear for women where we introduced a line of new casual transitional products.", "Similar to Vans, we see ecommerce as a huge opportunity. Hitting off the existing success in the UK market, Timberland is now live in three new countries; France, Germany and Italy. In Asia, first quarter revenues were up at low double-digit rate, including positive results across all our areas of business driven by strength in our classic boot in the both man's and woman's.", "Men's apparel performed well during the quarter driven by outerwear as consumers responded well to the new materials and silhouettes that we rolled out. Woman's apparel also saw an increase driven by outerwear, in particular lifestyle waterproof jacket. Consistent with the North Face and Vans, we are very happy with the momentum of the Timberland brand and really proud of the way the team continues to execute against our long-term growth targets.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear. ", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. Globally, revenues for the Wrangler brand were down 2% and revenues for Lee were down 1% in the quarter. The Jeanswear Americas business was down at a high single-digit percentage rate due to ongoing challenges in the U.S. mid-tier department store channel and to a lesser extent, consumer trends in women's denim. These challenges resulted in a lower single-digit decline for Wrangler in the Americas region and a high single-digit decline for the Lee brand.", "Of the high single-digit decline in the Jeanswear Americas business, roughly half of the decrease was due to a combination of a decline in the Rock & Republic brand as we worked to realign styles to meet consumer preferences and the exit of a lower profit private label business. That said, our results were consistent with what we expected. We're on track for our full year expectation of low single-digit growth. That implies acceleration in the Jeanswear Americas business in the second half of 2014.", "So given the environment, why the optimism? Product innovation, expanded distribution and focused integrated marketing campaigns. Let's walk through these drivers and I think you'll better understand what gives us confidence that we'll finish strong in the second half of the year. First, as I just mentioned, we're launching innovative new products focused on comfort which is what we know our consumers want.", "In Wrangler, you'll see the introduction of new products in our advanced comfort line and for the younger Western consumer, we'll be launching Rock 47. To address current trends in Lee's mass business, we plan to launch Heavenly Touch and in our mid tier business Easy Fit, both of which have stretched fabrication that combines the comfort of leggings with the structural benefits of denim. Mid tier will also see the launch of modern series Curvy Fit, a new line that features figure-enhancing contoured waist.", "Second, we're expanding our distribution to give more consumers greater access to our brands. Wrangler is moving more significantly into the mid-tier including JC Penney where we've already had a very successful test over the past few months. For Lee we will see additional door expansion into the department store channel including Macy's and Bon-Ton.", "Finally, we're connecting even better with our consumers. As you know, marketing science is a key asset VF offers its brands and our findings have been extremely valuable in sharpening our storytelling. We're starting to see great traction from these efforts including response to campaigns for advanced comfort which continues to resonate quite well with the consumers in the mass channel, and heightened visibility for Lee's modern series which successfully launched last fall. We've also upped our investment in Lee's point-of-sale which is currently rolling up to 2,000 doors across the U.S.", "Another great example of how we're connecting with consumers is our Wrangler network, which started live streaming PRCA rodeos in country music concerts, an effort that continues to be the cultural echo system with Wrangler at the center. The second quarter will remain challenging for the Jeanswear coalition but we're confident that that will return to growth in the second half of the year.", "Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Jeanswear international businesses.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Our international Jeanswear business performed really well in the first quarter. In Europe revenues were up at high single-digit percentage rate including strong growth in both the Wrangler and Lee business. And sales in Asia were up at low double-digit. Across both regions, key accounts and consumers alike have responded well to the continued evolution of our collections. We look forward to 2014 being one of the strongest years for our Jeanswear business in quite a few years.", "We remain focused on creating and marketing our innovative products in ways that form an stronger connection with consumers. In Europe, Wrangler has had success with its denim performance product. The Lee brand continues to see great strength with its stretch deluxe line for women and its blue label collection for men which features superior fabrics and comfort at competitive price points.", "In Asia, Lee returned to strong growth in the first quarter. We saw great performance from lines like our 101 plus collection which is a contemporary premium interpretation of our heritage denim offering. This line is seeing great consumer response and sell-throughs in both China and Hong Kong.", "Now Bob will take you through our financial highlights.", "Bob Shearer", "Thanks, Karl Heinz. Our first quarter is a great example of why VF's business model is successful in delivering consistent, profitable growth and meaningful returns to shareholders with diversity across products, brands and consumers, across channels, geographies and our supply chain, our unique competitive strengths have us well positioned to deliver yet another record year for VF.", "In fact, based on first quarter results, I'm happy to report that we're raising our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance but more on that a little later. Let's take a look at how we did. VF revenues were up 6.5% led by our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition with 14% revenue growth, which as Eric pointed out is even higher than the strong 12% growth we posted in the fourth quarter.", "Our international and direct-to-consumer businesses also showed strong gains with revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Gross margin was a great story as well reaching 49.4% in the quarter, an all-time record for any quarter in VF's history. This marks a 130 basis point improvement over last year. Of this improvement, about 90 basis points was due to mix.", "In other words, strongest growth in our highest margin businesses and about 30 basis points was due to the previously disclosed reclassification of retail concession fees. Also, great to notice is the fact that despite some headwinds in a few parts of our business, all five coalitions saw gross margin improvement in the first quarter.", "Now, I know you're probably questioning how after a 130 basis point improvement in the first quarter, we're holding our outlook to 49% for the full year. The answer is that as we look forward, we see some foreign currency headwinds and that's especially in the second quarter. In addition, the mix benefit was particularly magnified in the first quarter given the strength of Outdoor & Action Sports relative to other businesses.", "SG&A as a percent of revenues rose by 50 basis points. However, the increase was driven primarily by that same reclassification of retail concession fees. Excluding that, SG&A was relatively flat year-over-year even though we continued to invest heavily in our D2C business and marketing. Obviously this implies that we're successfully getting meaningful leverage elsewhere in our expense structure.", "And that's just how we think about our model. We invest heavily against our highest growth and most profitable brands and businesses supported by marketing science which drives our top line creating leverage elsewhere in our expense structure, and the result continuous improvement in our operating margin. At end of first quarter, operating margin improved 80 basis points to 14.5% all of which brings us to earnings per share of $0.67 which was up 12% over last year.", "Now I'll make a few comments on our coalition results for the first quarter. Revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports coalition were up 14% with high teen percentage growth in our direct-to-consumer business and low double-digit growth in wholesale sales, really hitting on all cylinders here; the North Face, Vans and Timberland were up 14%, 20% and 12%, respectively. And needless to say, we couldn't be more pleased with the continued strength and momentum of these powerful brands and the entire coalition. And of course, a 21% increase in operating income in the quarter with an improvement in operating margin of 100 basis points to 17.4%, well, that's not too bad either.", "Turning to Jeanswear, first quarter results were in line with what we expected with revenues down 4% due to ongoing pressure in the U.S. mid-tier channel, challenging consumer trends in women's denim and the exit of a lower profit business. That said, revenues outside of the U.S. which was a third of the business in the quarter were up at a mid-single-digit rate with particular strength in Europe and Asia. We do expect Jeanswear to post similar results in the second quarter, however, accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, driven by great new product innovations and channel expansion.", "For the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit growth for this highly profitable coalition. Our Imagewear group had a solid first quarter with 4% revenue growth driven in large part by our licensed sports business. We saw great success from strong NFL postseason sales. First quarter operating margin was up a healthy 180 basis points reaching 14.3%, driven by gross margin improvement and SG&A leverage.", "During the quarter, we decided to exit the youth business for Major League Baseball which hit our top line rate by 4 percentage points, however, sets us up for better profitability in the long run. Our sportswear business grew 3% in a somewhat challenging retail environment. Nautica revenues were flat impacted by the timing of special programs. Reflecting this shift, second quarter revenues for Nautica should grow at a low double-digit rate. Kipling's North American revenue was up at a high teen percentage rate with greater than 20% D2C growth. Globally, the Kipling brand grew 23%. Sportswear's profitability was up slightly with last year's same quarter.", "Revenue on our Contemporary Brands business declined 5% in the first quarter with a high single-digit decline in North American revenues offset by a high single-digit increase in Europe. Globally, the coalitions D2C business was up at a low teen rate but this was offset by a similar rate decline in the wholesale business, which continues to experience challenging demand for premium denim. Lower volume caused operating margin to decline to 8%.", "Similar to Imagewear, we decided to move a portion of this coalitions youth business towards a licensed model. This decision negatively impacted the revenue results by 3 percentage points in the quarter. VF's balance sheet remains very healthy. At the end of the quarter, inventories were up 7% compared with March 2013 levels including 2 percentage points related to higher costs and changes in foreign currency.", "During the quarter, we bought 9.1 million shares of VF stock for approximately $553 million and in the second quarter, we purchased an additional 2.9 million shares for $173 million to conclude the share buyback program that we spoke about in February. No additional share repurchases in 2014 are anticipated at this time.", "Now turning to our outlook for the full year, we now expect annual revenues to increase at the upper end of the 7% to 8% range we gave you in February, so close to 8% which is in line with the organic growth of our 2017 plan. Driving the increase is across-the-board strength within our Outdoor & Action Sports brands including the momentum in our Timberland business that Steve mentioned earlier. We now expect revenues in Outdoor & Action Sports to be up 12% to 13%.", "Our gross margin and operating margin expectations remain unchanged at 49% and 15%, respectively. With SG&A, as in the past, we will continue to look opportunistically for areas to make targeted investments in our brands, products and marketing to drive future growth. We now expect earnings per share to rise to approximately $3.06 per share representing 13% growth over 2013.", "In terms of the second quarter, we anticipate revenues to increase at a similar rate to that of the first quarter and again be driven primarily by continued strength from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.", "So to wrap things up, I'm really excited about 2014. It's a year that presents terrific opportunities for us to increase competitive separation, further optimize our profitability and create long-term value for our shareholders. So with a great first quarter in the books, we're very pleased by the underlying strength of our business and look forward to successfully executing against our growth strategies in 2014 and beyond.", "With that, I turn it back to the operator and we can open up the line for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Congrats on a great quarter and a tough market there.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Michael.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Bob, if I could, just a little bit housecleaning. First of all, your comments on SG&A that we'll look opportunistically for investments in the brand. Obviously, you give a little confidence in your revenue outlook for the year, but should we interpret that as if the revenues do track in at or above the range that you've given that you would try to dial back some SG&A into investments that might offset some of the upside in EPS for the year?", "Bob Shearer", "Really the way to think about that, Michael, is \u2013 what we've been doing is we've been making those investments pretty consistently over the past couple of years. Last year we increased our marketing spend by about $100 million and this year we're looking to increase by another $50 million. And the reality is it's working for us. It's driving the top line. We had a strong fourth quarter last year and we're seeing a lot of momentum, particularly in our Outdoor & Action Sports business here in the first quarter and we absolutely believe that those investments are part of that. So, the idea is that we would look to do the same. We're absolutely committed to our long-term targets and the 13% that we mentioned. And when we have the opportunity to make some of those investments both to help us on a shorter term basis, but especially on a long-term basis, that's what we'll do. So, again, the point is it's been working for us. And yes, we will look to do the same thing in those highest margin, fastest growing businesses.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up on \u2013 a little bit more on two things in the Jeanswear commentary. First off, the low margin business that you mentioned you exited, any more detail you could give us on that? And then more importantly, can we hear a little bit about the \u2013 you mentioned I think a new platform launch in the second half that kind of supports your guidance for a pretty meaningful acceleration in the growth rate there?", "Steve Rendle", "Yes, I think it's a couple of things. Let me take the platform first, Michael, since that's the most important one. I think the confidence really is around expanded distribution, so you know we're taking the Wrangler brand up into the mid-tier and we're taking Lee brand up in the department store channel. But in addition to that, we've got some really innovative products that are hitting the marketplace and that's Heavenly Touch and that's Easy Fit, both products that play into this new trend that we've seen in the marketplace. But what's important about that too is it's not just new products into that trend, its new products into the Jeanswear business also with our Rock 47 which is a big initiative for us for the younger Western consumer. So things like that that also play into our core categories in our business. But also, as you think about that, we've got some really strong integrated marketing campaigns and programs that are coming from POS in the stores to broader marketing programs that nearly support not only our core business but also support the initiatives that we have going forward. So that gives us great confidence in the second half. The first part of your question was it was a lower profit business that we made the decision to exit because it didn't fit our core and it wasn't what we did best, and we want to focus on the things that we do best and we want to focus on our brands.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Okay. Eric, any comments on the acquisition environment out there? Thanks a lot.", "Eric Wiseman", "No, Michael, no comments on the acquisition front. I will add to Bob's comments about the investment and just kind of go through how we think about it. And Michael you remember last year. We only grew organically 5% and that was disappointing to us and we invested $40 million in the fourth quarter to try to accelerate our growth rate to the 8% target we have in our long-range plan. And as Bob said, that seems to be working. So the way I think about that investment is if we make incremental investments \u2013 we will make incremental investments that deliver the results we promised in our 2017 plan, and we'll continue to make those investments to make sure that we deliver the 8% organically on the top line and 13% on the bottom line. And that's why we did it last year. Our growth rate was below what we planned. We wanted to get back on track to close to 8% and that's where we are.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Thanks again, guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Hi. Good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hi, Bob.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "I guess the first question is with the quarter ending in March and Easter, can you just give us \u2013 you have usually a very broad read across retail with the portfolio. Can you just walk us through how it impacted the business and sort of how it materialized when Easter happened and just sort of how you feel about the business at this point in time with Easter now behind us?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. I guess the easiest way for me to talk about that, Bob, is in our direct-to-consumer business where we like, everybody else, saw the impact of an Easter shift. And it was obviously a North American event, was significant in China. And our direct-to-consumer business for the quarter was up 16% and that included mid-single-digit comp store growth which we're thrilled with. We think mid-single-digit growth given all the days that stores were closed and the Easter shift is really strong. So we're confident in our direct-to-consumer business.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "And Bob \u2013 thanks, Eric \u2013 on the share repurchase program, is that the way that we should think about how you'll approach it going forward as well, just go heavy in the first quarter like you did and just maybe give us an update in terms of the approach that you've taken with that?", "Bob Shearer", "Yes, Bob, we have been pretty consistent in that. So when we're looking to buy back some shares, we've done that and got in done pretty much in the first quarter. We haven't changed our perspective in term of our buyback. We still look at it as primarily a means of offsetting the dilutive impact of option exercises. In a year like this we got a little bit ahead of that. Our option exercises \u2013 the buyback will outweigh the option exercises this year. But yes, generally the timing is pretty consistent. We've demonstrated that over a number of years and again no change in our strategy related to our buyback program.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Guys, congrats on a good quarter. Eric, can you talk about in general what you're seeing from the consumer today, drivers of the top line confidence here? I mean it's definitely one of the rarities out there. Any visibility you can speak to in fall orders I think would be really helpful?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. The North American consumer is in general struggling we think. I mean they're really resilient. They keep fighting back but it is not easy out there. If you look at the first quarter that we just went through, particularly in the mid-tier and mass channel where people have less discretionary income, they were challenged with higher heating bills and healthcare costs, a lot of things came at them that affected their discretionary income and it showed up there. Where we had great growth was in our direct-to-consumer business worldwide, but we're at a different price level than what a mid-tier and mass is those stores and we did really well. We also know that while consumer spending was tough to find, if you had amazing products supported by impactful marketing, you could win. And one of the reasons we invested so heavily in the fourth quarter behind our brands was we knew we had the right products that consumers would want. We wanted to make sure that they knew that and we really dialed up the marketing in the fourth quarter and that momentum carried forward into the first quarter this year and we're pretty happy with 6.5% organic growth.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Absolutely. So as you look forward in terms of orders, are you seeing your retail partners buy the brands to stock on the shelves that are driving the organic traffic? I'm curious what you're seeing as you see the orders coming in?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. The objective that \u2013 we don't disclose our forward order book, but obviously if we're sitting at 6.5% and guiding to close to 8% for the full year with the biggest part of the year coming at us, that sends the message that our marketing was effective, our products sold through and as Steve commented, our product line up coming in the fall in Vans, Timberland and in North Face in particular. Scott talked about our jeans business. We think we have a great product line up for fall and we've got orders to support us giving an increase in our revenue guidance for the year.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Great. And then last question on Timberland. We've clearly seen the top line inflect here last couple of quarters. Can you talk globally about where do you see the biggest opportunity going forward and from a margin perspective, where do you stand kind of versus that mid-teens goal?", "Eric Wiseman", "So I'm going to pass that over to Steve and Karl Heinz for comment on.", "Steve Rendle", "So real quick on the Americas business, we're just seeing really strong growth across all of our regions; Canada, U.S., Mexico, all channels and all categories. And it's very much a broad brand momentum. Historically, you've seen Timberland surge in single items or categories. The brand heat that building around Timberland, we give a lot of credit to the work we've done with our end consumer, really understanding who they are, how to connect with them and how that's influenced our product. The product creation component of this brand has been dramatically elevated. You see that at retail today. How we're able to market to and speak with our consumer and connect with them at retail has really been dramatically improved. And as we continue to drive better product at full price through our retail channels, we're seeing strong growth in our gross margins and our ability to really have the dollars to invest behind this brand.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Matthew, just to add a few color in Europe, you heard me saying last quarter we started to grow. We had a solid growth in this one and it's an indicator that we're looking forward to a good year. We had a lot of work to do in the last year with Timberland. We moved it. It's all set now. We have a strong team in place. It's all working basically. Asia is good also. It had been consistently growing since the acquisition double digit. It's strong in Japan, but we have a great opportunity in China where we basically just started and it's one of our smaller brands in China. So it's a long way to go there.", "Bob Shearer", "And related to the margin question, we are right on track with our acquisition plan in terms of moving toward that mid-teen percentage that we committed to initially when we acquired the brand. So, I'm seeing nice progress and it's right on track with where we expect to be.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Great. Best of luck, guys.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Matthew.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hi, Kate.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Bob, I wanted to ask you with regards to gross margin. Are you currently ahead of where you thought you would be on gross margins at this point in time when you gave your targets in June? And how should we think about the cadence of gross margin for the rest of the year given from the FX headwinds and the strength of Q1?", "Bob Shearer", "Kate, we're on track with what we expected. We did expect the first quarter to be a little stronger than the overall year guiding to the 90 basis point expansion. In terms of looking out at the last three quarters, as I said in my commentary, a little pressure on the FX side in the second quarter. So we'll likely be a little below the 90 basis point improvement but nice solid improvement in our gross margin. Third quarter should be pretty close to the 90 basis point and then fourth quarter, as you can imagine with the inclusion of the stronger D2C we'll be a little bit above that. So, yes, we're tracking very, very close to what we expected and are really confident in the 90 basis point expansion for the year.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "That's helpful. Thank you. And then my next question is for Karl Heinz with the overall environment in Europe. If you could talk on a comp basis, because I know you have a lot of white space potential and incremental growth in Europe as well, but on a comp basis where have you seen the most improvement in your business? And what region or country has surprised you most to the upside and what area is still struggling?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Kate, thanks for this question. We announced a good quarter in Europe and it's widely reported the economic situation and we can't do a lot there. It's not the best. But I guess the good news is, and this is the strength of our portfolio, most of the brand, also the brands which we normally don't report, the smaller ones like Kipling or Napa or Reef, they're doing really well. They are all growing. And actually what we see especially in Southern Europe is coming back strongly. Italy is a big market for us. It's the largest market for Timberland. It's really doing well. So, we're happy with that. I would say we play out the strength of our portfolio, a lot of things are doing well and we look forward to a good quarter and a good year actually.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Kate.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Good morning, Omar.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Eric, first question for you. Your Actions Sports & Outdoor segment obviously has been phenomenal. You've done a lot of great acquisitions there. There's almost a megatrend going on with active healthy living, active lifestyle. But there's many different segments to this whole phenomenon. Obviously you've got a lot of them covered in your portfolio. Could you talk about, I don't know, Actions Sports versus Outdoor sub-segments within it where you see the most attractive kind of opportunity from an industry standpoint where the trends are going? Maybe some areas where you're not as actively involved? Maybe the athletic part of it, the world there, maybe you feel like some of your existing brand assets you could use to go after the athletic segment or maybe you want to bring in more assets for that? Just think on the broader perspective around that whole segment given how much success you've had and it looks like the trend was going to continue structurally? Thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, Omar. Action Sports for us is defined by Vans and Reef with Vans being by far the biggest piece of that business for us, and as we reported not only our fastest growing coalition in the quarter where we up 20% but Vans was our biggest brand in the quarter. So Vans was VF's number one revenue brand in the quarter. So that is a big business for us and it's kind of zeroing on the $2 billion mark here pretty quickly. So, we are really important in that space and the opportunity for us there and was mentioned during some of the comments is our footwear business and that was a footwear brand that we're taking to apparel and we're doing a better and better job of taking it to both men's and women's apparel going to a four season calendar and getting some growth there. The Outdoor coalition is defined by the two big brands really, the North Face and Timberland, which reported growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, in the quarter. So those three big brands are really, really pulling more than their share. They're doing really, really well. The athletics space is a space that we operate in the fringe on. Does the North Face have athletic styles? Yes. The Mountain Athletics program, the new ultra kilowatt line, all of that is geared towards training not towards team sports but towards training and fitness, and that is an emerging trend. And between the North Face getting into that space and Lucy being into that space for her and Lucy had a solid quarter. It had double-digit growth in the first quarter. We think we have the opportunity to do more in that space. Omar, does that address your question.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Yes. No, I mean just\u2026", "Eric Wiseman", "If not, we'll turn it over to Bob.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Of course, Bob, if you have anything to add. But there are just so many opportunities and it's such a secularly growing segment, and there's so many other brands out there having success and it doesn't seem like it's going to end anytime soon. It's become such a big part of your business. It can become really intricate how you think about the different elements within it and what assets you have to use to go after it, and assets maybe you want to bring in, in the future.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, and to the point Karl Heinz touched on is one of our strengths in Outdoor & Action Sports in the quarter was it wasn't just those big three brands I mentioned growing. We had momentum in pretty much every space we were in from Smartwool to Lucy to Napapijri. I mean we had a good quarter in that space.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "All right. One quick follow-up, maybe Bob to an extent. On ASPs we do seem to be seeing industry-wide some premiumization trend or at least a barbell effect in those brands that can generate a higher price point, higher quality, more innovative product. Are you guys seeing that in your businesses or within some of the brands within your businesses?", "Bob Shearer", "Average selling price is the question. I'm just looking at some of the other folks here in the room as well. Number one, our pricing is up just a little bit and I don't think that's exactly what you're getting at but our pricing is up a little bit and relative to average prices that we're seeing across the board. I might ask Steve to comment in terms of what you're seeing in his business.", "Steve Rendle", "Sure. Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, we've seen \u2013 our average selling price in our own stores move up incrementally and where we're able to do that is where we're adding greater value from a technology, fit function and form. But also as we're able to really drive home that emotional marketing message that links back to the product and how we move our consumers through the funnel and we saw great results of that starting last \u2013 in fourth quarter for the North Face and really carried through the momentum that we saw coming into first quarter. And we used those learnings across all of our brands within this portfolio to drive that.", "Bob Shearer", "I guess what I'd say there, Omar, as well is what we are seeing is consumers are paying for innovation. I think that's what Steve is saying as well. We're seeing that consistently and that's why we think our innovation platform is so important for us.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks.", "Steve Rendle", "And that's true for Vans and Timberland as well. I was probably remiss in not mentioning that. Some of the products that we're seeing move through Vans today as we bring in cushioning technology, durability materials into these skate shoes, we're getting a lot of credit for that and we're able to ask for a higher price and capture that all the way through the channel and clearly at Timberland as we've elevated the product. We're seeing starting with the yellow boot all the way through our footwear collection driving full price retail sell-through across not only our own channels but our wholesale partner channels.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Got you. Thanks, guys.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Omar.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.", "Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Dave Weiner. How are you? So I wanted to drill down a little bit or expand a little on gross margin. Clearly you still have mix shifts, the ability to grow gross margin through mix shifts, coalition, geography and channel. But I guess could you talk longer term, maybe the opportunity to \u2013 what other drivers can be used to drive gross margin? I'm thinking specifically, I think you have an initiative in place to switch X percentage of your or migrate X percentage of your production of product from sourcing to manufacturing. Maybe an update on how that's coming along and kind of what \u2013 are you getting more technical product in that bucket? And kind of what implications that could have for gross margin? Thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes. So just to I guess confirm what you were saying is relative to the mix shift, as we look out over the next five years and just as we spoke about when we presented our 2017 plan that mix improvement, the mix leverage will continue without a doubt. So we're very, very consistently seeing that 60 to 70 basis points pretty much every quarter and every year and that's exactly what we expect to see over the period. On top of that we continue to manufacture a greater percentage of our own goods in our plants much, much more so than any of our competition and a lot of that is in our Jeanswear business and we produce a pair of jeans at a lower cost and is available anywhere in the globe. And we're looking at new innovative ways to see even further benefits, I guess, from the capabilities that we have from a manufacturing standpoint. So, building stronger partnerships with people outside of our existing space in terms of where we manufacturer goods today is part of our story. So, the idea is leverage the skill set that we have that can't be matched by anyone else in the industry from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that skill set and lower cost that is available by others.", "Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess Karl Heinz, just for you, a follow-up on the Italian comments you made. You talked about it doing a little bit better. I guess my understanding just broadly in Italy is that the pressure over the last several years has really just been this continued culling away of the independent channels and multi-branded retailers, they've continue to shutter their doors. I guess are you guys seeing some stabilization in the wholesale channel as well or at this point is it really just improvements in the direct-to-consumer piece of that business?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Erinn. I think it's both. We have a pretty strong component of partnership stores primarily with Timberland. We have more than 100 stores, so that is one component. We also see the overall economy is doing a little bit better, which is good and we also see the larger customers having stabilized (indiscernible) and all the guys you know. So, Italy is a very fragmented market as you know, but for sure we have seen a stabilization there and the outlook I think is better than it used to be last year. But again, it's a market where we have very strong partnership stores, especially on Timberland and they clearly help us.", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. That's really helpful actually Karl Heinz. And then I guess on the North Face overall, Q1 versus Q4, really good incremental improvement there as well. Just from a product perspective, if you guys could just reflect on what's driving some of that incremental strength in the first quarter? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Is this question in Europe or in general?", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "Sorry, in general actually for the entire line.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, I think Steve mentioned it well. They have a lot of new stuff happening and new products primarily. This is a product industry, as you know, and we came out with a lot of innovation and it's paying off. Thermoball is one example, we mentioned that clearly and that's where our strategy is also going forward. Consumers are looking and paying for innovation.", "Steve Rendle", "I can build on that a little bit. I think if you were to look at it from a four season basis or first half/second half, we had a really significant launch with Thermoball last fall. The emotional marketing with the singular focus against that initiative driving consumer through that funnel to conversion was a very powerful campaign. We brought that into spring with the launch of our ultra performance footwear as well as our Mountain Athletic training apparel, while also continuing to support Thermoball as it really is a three season jacket, a transitional weight, but the only question around the fitness trend \u2013 North Face has significant permission to move into this athletic space but we're doing it in a very authentic way where we're using Mountain Athletics as an apparel collection and coupling it with training seminars or workouts; San Francisco, Washington D.C. are great examples where we had these Train Smarter outdoor training events where we were able to bring consumers to train with our athletes and begin to tailor programs for the support that the North Face builds products for. So definitely looking to expand technical collections based on our consumers needs and really link it with emotional marketing and that pull through push through retail.", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you and congratulations.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. As you think about the product costs and obviously pricing, what are you seeing in terms of product cost? Is it different in terms of region or different in terms of product category? And then on Southern Europe coming back, is that from locals, from tourists? Are you seeing it in wholesale, retail? Thank you and congratulations.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Dana. I'll start on the cost side. Really not a lot of movement in costs overall for the year. We came into the year expecting a little bit more and that's been a little better situation than we first thought. So what we're seeing from a cost side is the number would be about a half a point of cost increase overall for our business and that's been offset by little pricing. So, pricing net of cost is neutral for us in 2014.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "The second comment, it's actually very consistent. We see it in our future orders which are nicely up. We see it in our retail trends. We see it in our partnership stores and overall, as I mentioned before, the overall economy is for sure improving this market. I would add also the strength of our portfolio is for sure helping us. Customers are looking to reliable vendors with strong initiative and for sure we are one of those.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Dana.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Eric Wiseman", "Good morning.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs", "I have a question just on Jeanswear. Scott, I was hoping you could give a little more detail on the channel expansion, so maybe more specifics on where you're rolling into, how much incremental square footage that adds to your distribution or sort of how incremental you think it could be for sales? And then the sequence you've got, is it really a Q3 event or is this something where we get an initial start in Q3 and there is more expansion to be had as we move across the next several quarters? Thanks.", "Scott Baxter", "Sure. You bet. So let's start with the beginning, let's start with mid-tier. We have the Wrangler brand, as you know, has been very strong in the mass channel for many years and also in the Western channel. The brand has gained a lot of strength in the last few years relative to the health of the brand and how people work with the brand and how people lived a lifestyle with the brand. And as these channels merge a little bit closer together, we saw a real opportunity to bring that brand to the mid-tier, to bring it to that mid-tier American consumer and that's going to start really strong probably fourth quarter, first half of next year but the testing has already been done in the first half of this year and we really like what we see and we really like the response that we've gotten from that consumer. So that's a big channel. There are really big consumers in that channel, really big customers in that channel, so we feel like that's a really good thing going forward for the Wrangler brand and it's pretty new for the brand and a lot of opportunity going forward. From a Lee perspective, the Lee brand has the permission to go to a channel a little bit higher and that being the department store channel. What we haven't talked enough about and probably spend enough time talking about is the fact that Lee has actually been at the department store channel for many years with a couple of customers and has full distribution at one large department store channel. And with that we've really expanded that to the other big department store players in the country and has had great traction on Lee female. So, obviously, as we continue to have really good traction on Lee female, we're going to think more broadly about male too and we think that that's going to gain really good traction in addition to what we already have in the second half of this year, so you'll see more traction there in the second half and then we'll expand it to male in '15 going forward. So, all-in-all, there's a lot of opportunity for both brands to expand and grow.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs", "And then could you guys help us quantify maybe how incremental that might be to sales for you over the second half?", "Scott Baxter", "That's kind of hard to do right now over the second half, but as the year progress I think that will be an opportunity for us to discuss that going forward.", "Eric Wiseman", "But it's clearly a factor that as we indicated, we expect our acceleration in our Jeanswear business, the numbers in the second half and it's clearly a factor.", "Scott Baxter", "We baked into the plan going forward.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Lindsay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA Americas.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services", "Hi, everybody. Good quarter. Of the brands in your existing portfolio, outside of the top five big ones, are there any that could be accelerated to add more scale, like Kipling, Lucy, Napapijri, how would you do that? And if so, how would you do that?", "Scott Baxter", "Yes, yes and yes to those three brands. In fact we have active initiatives underway in all of those brands to be amongst the size that our current big plans are. Particularly around Kipling where we've been working for quite a while on a growth program there, Kipling was a very small business when we bought it. It is not a very small business anymore. Last year it was VF's fastest growing brand for the year and grew with our fastest growing brand in three of the four quarters of last year. So, it has terrific momentum. Nautica for the last 24 months has had terrific momentum. Napapijri has great momentum. So each of our brands is part of our growth strategy and we're investing in all of them to achieve what they believe their potential is, different programs.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then could you share any kind of market share information you might have, U.S., Europe, Asia for Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeans?", "Eric Wiseman", "We really don't have that information in Outdoor & Action Sports because the categories are so broadly defined, it's hard to look at them when we look at apparel versus equipment versus footwear, we don't really have that information.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services", "And Jeanswear?", "Scott Baxter", "Very similar. It's hard to define exactly from a category standpoint.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Barbara.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hi, Robby.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, Eric. How are you? I just had a follow-up on China. Could you guys talk about maybe what the overall environment looks? It's pretty incredible, the growth you guys are doing. Is the Chinese consumer sort of reaccelerating again? Others in other categories, they've had more problems, I'd say, over the last 12 months over there or more. And then may be just a shorter follow-up. The 100% growth in Vans, can you help us think about what the sort of annual growth rate for Vans should be? Can you do 100% for the year over there or how long can you maintain that growth? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you. Let me start with the last piece, doing 100% every quarter I think is hard. Having said that, I always give the same answer. China is a great long-term opportunity for us, it's like a marathon and we do well every quarter. I want to remind you we are actually in China with primarily four brands that we're investing at the moment directly and have very long \u2013 big opportunities in terms of penetration. Our total door count is, all four combined, 2,500 doors which is still very, very low. So I guess the opportunities going forward is long term. We only have operated four brands at the time. We have opportunities in penetration. And specifically Vans you mentioned, clearly 100% is hard to achieve but Vans is a fast growing brand. It resonates well with consumers. It's one of the top four and it's for sure a big, big opportunity for us in China.", "Eric Wiseman", "Robby, to add some perspective, two weeks ago yesterday, Karl Heinz and I were in China opening an 850,000 square foot distribution center that we just built for over $60 million about an hour outside of Shanghai. So, we are committed to China. We see enormous potential there. Across our portfolio we're focused on a few brands now and all of them are at the early stages of their development. So we put a bit stake in the ground and plan to grow there in a big way.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That sounds great. Thanks so much.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Robby.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie", "Thank you for taking my question. Overall, impressive numbers out of Asia. A follow-up on Robby's question on China. With the anticipated DC in Kunshan, can we anticipate additional one-time investments for this region to fuel future growth?", "Eric Wiseman", "We've been investing in that region \u2013 we've been focused on it now for about seven odd years, we've been there for a long time. We opened our first subsidiary there in 1995, so that was Lee and so we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of VF direct investment in China. But a lot of the momentum has happened in the last five to seven years. And our Asia Pacific regions should break $1 billion this year and China is still half of that. We make investments behind our brands. We're making investments in infrastructure to support our brands. We made a lot of investments in marketing in the last couple of years to build categories that didn't exist. A great example of that is the Outdoor category didn't really exist there five to ten years ago and we've been investing a lot to help define what that category should look like in that region and the North Face is the leader in Outdoor in China and I think we launched there in 2007. So, still very early days, lots of potential and we're excited by it.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie", "Okay, great. And then in terms of labor costs, are you seeing anything for the balance of the year?", "Bob Shearer", "No change certainly from what we anticipated. No, we're not seeing any escalation or any reductions either, a pretty stable environment.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Bob Shearer", "You bet.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc.", "Edward Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in there. You guys recently realigned your management structure I think to more closely mirror the structure you had in international. I guess any outcomes you're looking for as a result of that? And how do you think this will help accelerate your growth in the U.S.? Thanks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. One of our platforms that \u2013 one of the things that we think will deliver more potential to VF is what we call 1VF which is having our \u2013 we're organized by brand and we empower each brand to achieve their potential, but we gained most when we work across our company. And our hope is that this structure will encourage more of that because it takes a lot of individual leaders working together to make that happen. Everybody is kind of heads down on their brand, but we find when we \u2013 the more we share the better we get. So, that was a big point underline the organization structure change.", "Edward Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Let's turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. Hey, listen, we've got the year off to a great start. We appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to catching back up in 90 days and we'll give you another outlook on how we're doing. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss V.F.'s second quarter 2014 results. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everybody that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "Participants may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, which was issued at 7 a.m. Eastern Time and on our website at vfc.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO; and V.F. executives, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.", "Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit your questions to two questions per caller. Thanks.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric Wiseman. Eric?", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our second quarter and with our year-to-date results not just because they're consistent with our outlook, but also because we're winning where and how we said we would. Although V.F. second quarter is the smallest revenue and earnings quarter of our fiscal year, our strong top and bottomline results are a great example of our ability to create and build sustainable momentum.", "And momentum is the key theme you'll hear throughout today's call. Momentum isn't luck and it's not random. It's earned through focused strategies that come together to consistently generate multiple growth opportunities across our diverse portfolio. We never stopped creating great products. We never stopped elevating our relevant to in connection with our consumers and we never stopped strengthening our balance sheet to enhance long-term shareholder value.", "The V.F. revenues in the second quarter were up 8%, which is right in line with the organic growth component of our 2017 plan. This is acceleration also of the 6.5% growth we achieved in the first quarter. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition delivered the biggest gain in the quarter, with revenues up 16%. This is also acceleration off of the first quarter with notable performances from the big three brands. The North Face was up 11%. Vans was up 21%. And Timberland was up 19%.", "Our direct-to-consumer business delivered 18% revenue growth with double-digit gains in every region around the world and nearly every single brand in the portfolio. Looking towards the second half of 2014, which is the biggest period for a D2C business, we're well positioned to leverage both our brick and mortar and e-commerce channels to strengthen our brands and drive revenue growth.", "Our international business also showed accelerated momentum with revenues up 14%, reflecting double-digit increases in both our European and Asia-Pacific regions and strength across both the D2C and wholesale channels. Our gross margin at 48.4% was about in line with our expectations and at 48.9% for the first half of 2014. We're squarely on track to meet our full year outlook for 49%. Second quarter operating margin reached 9.2%, a 10 basis point improvement over last year, reflecting slight SG&A leverage and our earnings per share increased 16% to $0.36 per share.", "Since we announced our 2017 targets more than a year ago, V.F. has shown considerable resilience and exceptional results in the face of the challenging global economic environment, a highly competitive retail landscape and inconsistent consumer trends. When I look at the solid execution of our strategic growth drivers combined with our unrelenting focus on operational excellence, I am extremely confident about our ability to deliver consistent long-term value to our consumers and our shareholders.", "With that, I'm going to turn this call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott to take you through our five largest brands. And then Bob will go through our financial results. Steve, it's over to you.", "Steve Rendle", "Thanks, Eric. The key growth strategy of The North Face brand success has been our ability to create products with industry leading innovation that equip and inspire consumers to get outdoors, push the boundaries of their own personal journey. This journey of course is a year round exploration. And because of that, over the past couple of years, you've heard us detail our strategies to evolve The North Face into a four season brand for our consumers.", "While I'm happy to report that these efforts are really paying off with strong results in our second quarter, with global revenues up 11%, including 37% growth in our D2C business and healthy increase in our wholesale sales. This was The North Face's strongest second quarter ever. In the Americas, revenues were up at a mid-teen percentage rate with double-digit increases in both wholesale and D2C. Our transitional products, led by Thermoball, continued to perform at extremely high levels, validating our ability to bring outerwear solutions to consumers across multiple seasons.", "We're also particularly proud of the launch of our Mountain Athletics apparel and Ultra Protection footwear collections. Both of these collections, which saw a great sell-through across all channels, significantly amplify our ability to serve the core outdoor consumer on a year round basis. Of course, great products are only a part of the equation. We continue to strengthen our strategies to connect our brand and products to consumers, looking for even more meaningful ways to engage and inspire them.", "This fall, you'll see the launch of a new US TV campaign designed to inspire the explorer in everyone and to drive an emotional connection to his/her own personal adventure. This effort of course will be connected to the in-store experience and new store openings to increase customer engagement across our D2C business and wholesale partners. Definitely a very exciting fall ahead of us.", "To sum it up, we had a great second quarter in the Americas. Now let me turn it over to Karl Heinz to walk you through TNF's result in Europe and Asia.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, The North Face saw a high single-digit increase in revenues in the second quarter with our D2C business up nearly 40%, including very strong online sales. We are especially pleased with these results and believe we are all well positioned for the third quarter, generally the banks' biggest quarter of the year in Europe.", "On the product side, we saw strong results in our running and training categories with several running pieces receiving accolades in respected industry publication. Also, the Ultra series footwear collection successfully launched in Europe. We're also making great progress in advancing The North Face towards the four season brand. To support this strategy, we executed our biggest ever marketing campaign in 10 countries focusing on key spring/summer categories like running, training and hiking. These efforts are driving significant sales to add brand awareness across Europe.", "Turning to Asia, sales were down at the mid single-digit rate in the quarter as we held back shipments to proactively manage channel inventory. We expect a strong finish to the year, returning to double-digit growth in the second half. We will see some positive momentum as we continue to build brand awareness to events like the TNF 100 and (inaudible) race in China, which affected over 3,000 participants and extensive media coverage across three events.", "We also resumed our TV campaign in China to build on the momentum we gained from our efforts last fall. Globally, The North Face remains on track to achieve 12% revenue growth in 2014.", "Now turning to Vans.", "Steve Rendle", "Global revenues for the Vans brand in the second quarter were up 21%, including strong double-digit revenue growth across all regions and channels. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for Vans, which is an incredibly impressive accomplishment.", "In the Americas, revenue grew at a high-teen rate, including a similar growth rate in both our D2C and wholesale channels. It was truly a great quarter for the brand, both strategically and tactically, with strong product launches and targeted efforts to further connect Vans directly to our consumers through our own content platforms and events.", "On the product front, we had a very successful launch of our unique Star Wars collaboration with Boutique and Lifestyle retailers. And to kick off back-to-school and rethinking what a future classic might be for Vans, we've just launched our classic light footwear, which combines the newer silhouettes like Authentic, Old Skool and SK8-HI with our super-comfortable and light weight ultra-cushion sole.", "Our apparel efforts also continue to be a focus with the launch of our summer collection, the very first time Vans has had a four season offering. Utilizing our four brand pillars, action sports, art, music and street culture, the Vans team is hard at work creating platforms and encourage creative expression. First up, June marked the launch of the 20th edition of the Vans (inaudible). We're already halfway through the more than 40 dates and 30 states scheduled in the US and Canada. And once again, it's an epic summer celebrating music, youth culture and the Vans brand. And two weeks from now, more than 750,000 people will immerse themselves in the unique Vans culture as they attend the 2014 Vans US Open of Surfing, the industry's largest surf event.", "And finally, our Fifth Annual Custom Culture Art Competition garnered 2,000 entries from high schools in every state across the US. Great product connected through authentic relative relevant events, while keeping youth culture at the center of everything we do combined for yet another stellar quarter for Vans. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz", "Vans had another great quarter in Europe, with revenues growing at high-teen rate, including more than 40% D2C growth and a low double-digit increase in wholesale sales. As in Americas, the Star Wars collection performed extremely well. In fact, before we launched the main product, we released a limited number of special edition products that sold out in 24 hours. The broader Star Wars release also has seen tremendous success.", "We're also proud to announce that our first European House of Vans opens on August 9th. Located in one of London's most iconic spaces beneath Waterloo station, House of Vans launch represents our commitment to creativity from art and music to skateboarding and fashion. This represents an amazing vehicle to engage and inspire youth culture in this extremely important market.", "In Asia, men's revenue grew more than 40%, including more than a sixth increase in China. Especially exciting here is the meaningful acceleration of our apparel and accessories category, which saw strong results during the quarter. And at the start of the year, our Artist program saw great sell-through. Further evidence to our ability to go local and address regionally specific consumer preference is key to long-term success.", "Additionally, our Van Doren and Star Wars footwear collections were very successful. We also brought our House of Vans concept for the third time to Beijing Music Festival, which generated a lot of great buzz online and engaged more than 750,000 consumers in the Vans band. What a great finish to the first half of 2014. The Vans brand remains on track to deliver a mid-teen increase in global revenues for the full year and become V.F.'s second $2 billion brand.", "Now let's turn to Timberland.", "Steve Rendle", "Globally, Timberland posted outstanding results for the second quarter, with revenues up 19%, driven by more than 25% growth in wholesale revenues and a 10% growth in its D2C business. And although it's the smallest revenue and earnings quarter of the year, we couldn't be more pleased with the continued progress this powerful brand is making.", "In the Americas, revenues were up nearly 25%, driven by more than 35% growth in our wholesale business, a definitively clear indicator that our product, consumer connectivity and channel distribution strategies are working quite well. With great results across every footwear category from boat and casual shoes to hiking and boots to Timberland PRO's new Boondock family, the success is broad based and balanced.", "Throw in continued success and momentum of apparel in the Americas with strong spring sell-through and fall sell-in were positioned were strongly going into the second half of the year. We're also working hard to drive brand visibility and consumer demand for the brand. Our Best Then Better Now brand campaign has been successful in helping us to reposition Timberland with consumers as a lifestyle brand. And we're starting to see very positive data that indicates consumers in the Americas are starting to recognize the brand as much more than a boot company.", "Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to discuss Timberland's business internationally.", "Karl Heinz", "Timberland's revenues in Europe were up at the mid-teen rate in the second quarter. Similar to the Americas, we also saw balanced and broad-based positive trends across our products. From a channel perspective, we had double-digit growth in both D2C and wholesale, so very balanced.", "Continuing to take advantage of the huge e-commerce opportunity in the region, we've now added The Netherlands and Spain to the roster. This is in addition to the first quarter launches into France, Germany and Italy, a huge leap forward in our platform that enables us to better reach consumers, tell stories and connect them every even more deeply with the brand.", "In Asia, second quarter revenues increased at the mid-teen rate, with strength across all channels in the business. Growth in the region was highlighted by strong sales of our classic boots and boot shows in men's. In addition, apparel, which is about half the business in Asia, is tracking in line with our plan. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we've earned at Timberland. And we have great confidence moving into the second half of the year as we work towards our goal of 12% global growth.", "And now let's move to Jeanswear. Scott?", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, Karl Heinz. Global revenues for the Jeanswear coalition were down 1%, reflecting improvement over the first quarter, the result of a slightly better than our expectations. In the quarter, global revenues for the Wrangler brand were up 4%, while revenues for the Lee brand were down 7%.", "In the Americas, the Jeanswear business was down to a low single-digit rate due to continued challenges in the US mid-tier channel and the ongoing unfavorable women's denim trend. These factors had the biggest impact on the Lee brand with its 60-to-40 ratio of women-to-men sales and a high degree of exposure to the mid-tier channel. This resulted in a mid-teen decline in Lee's Americas business. Wrangler on the other hand, with only 20% of revenues from the women's category and a depth of three different channel weighting saw a mid-single digit increase in the Americas. In fact, both the mass and western specialty businesses grew in the quarter.", "All of this is pretty much what we expected coming into the quarter and we continue to expect slight growth in the global business for the full year due to an accelerated second half. So why the confidence in the second why? The same reasons I outlined on last call, new product introductions, expanded distribution and enhanced demand creation strategies. For example, in Wrangler, we're set to launch our Advanced Comfort line, the brand's more comfortable jeans yet. And to celebrate this launch, we're hosting a major kick-off event with Drew Brees in Comfort, Texas, a small town that embodies everything the brand stands for, hard work, integrity and an appreciation for the small things in life.", "On the Lee side, Heavenly Touch and Easy Fit, which have stretch fabrication that combines the comfort of leggings with the structural benefits of denim are on track to launch in the mid-tier in mass channels. And as I mentioned on last call, the mid-tier will also see the launch of Modern series Curvy Fit. And to support these launches, you will see a new fall campaign supporting active comfort for men and curvy fit for women. So all in all, a tough environment in the Americas, but our brands and products are well positioned and our inventories are in very good shape as we move into the second half.", "Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz", "Our international Jeanswear business had done exceptional quarter. In Europe, revenues increased at the mid-teen percentage rate, led by 25% growth in the Lee business and high single-digit growth in Wrangler. And in Asia, Lee continued its growth in the second quarter with a low single-digit increase with considerably stronger expectations in the second half.", "Similar to the first quarter, key accounts and consumers in both regions continued to respond strongly to the evolution of our collections. Our products are resonating well. Our connection with consumers is getting deeper and our geographic expansion strategy is working.", "So 2014 is shaping up to be one of the strongest years in quite some time with significant topline growth and margin expansion. In closing, in the second half, we expect global Jeanswear revenues to grow at the low to mid single-digit rate, with some growth in the third quarter and substantially stronger results in the fourth quarter.", "Now Bob will take you through our financial highlights.", "Bob Shearer", "Well, thanks, Karl Heinz. Well, as Eric mentioned, the second quarter represents the smallest revenue and by far the smallest earnings quarter in the context of V.F.'s fiscal year. Now that said, we couldn't be more proud of our results. Strong contributions from our largest coalition and our biggest brands help us to deliver industry leading results. And with the first half behind us, we've got great confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook.", "Now taking a look at our second quarter, total V.F. revenues were up 8%, driven by accelerated results in our key growth drivers, including Outdoor & Action Sports, which was up 16%; international revenues, which grew by 14%; and our D2C business, which was up 18% in the quarter. These have been our core growth drivers over the past few years. They will be for the remainder of 2014 and will be for years to come. In so many ways, we're just scratching the surface related to these powerful growth engines.", "Our gross margin of 48.4% was about in line with our expectations. To look at a few of the parts, on the positive side, we saw another quarter of predictable mix benefit from the shift of our revenues toward higher margin businesses. There were however two main offsets that tempered this benefit. First was foreign currency impact, which we spoke about on our last call. The good news here is this was isolated to the second quarter. The currency impact should be relatively neutral in the second half of this year.", "The second offset came from our efforts to aggressively manage inventories mainly related to our Jeanswear business, which continues to be challenged, especially in the mid-tier channel that Scott talked about earlier. To avoid taking markdowns, we took downtime in our own jeans factories, something V.F. is uniquely positioned to do to reduce markdown risk going forward. What was a result of our disciplined approach to inventory management? Well, inventories were up only 6% in front of the second half of the year when we expect revenues to grow close to 9%.", "All in, our first half gross margin sits at 48.9%, which puts us right on track to reach our outlook of 49% for the full year. Without a doubt, we're very pleased with the continued evolution of our gross margin story.", "Now turning to SG&A, our SG&A ratio to revenues was down slightly despite our continued investments focused in D2C and marketing. We're operating 140 more stores now than we did at the same time last year. Given that significantly larger base and as you all know, D2C carries a higher SG&A ratio to revenues and that our marketing expense as a percent of revenues also grew slightly in the quarter, well, that means we realized significant leverage in other parts of our cost structure. And that's our model. We make investments to drive topline. We find leverage elsewhere in our expense structure and improve our profitability.", "Taking all of this to the bottomline, our operating margin was up by 10 basis points to 9.2% and earnings per share were up 16% to $0.36 for the quarter. That's right in line with our expectations and definitely a quarter we're really pleased with.", "Now let me touch on our coalition results for the second quarter. As I mentioned, revenues for our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition were up 16%, but perhaps equally impressive was the channel balance that drove that. We had more than a 20% increase in D2C sales and a low-teen increase in wholesale revenues. We also had great balance on a regional basis. Our Americas and international businesses, both experienced about the same percentage increases.", "Given the results Steve and Karl Heinz went over earlier for The North Face, Vans and Timberland, along with other brands that are smaller today like Napapijri, Kipling, EASTPAK and SmartWool, all of which grew by more than 20% in the quarter, well, needless to say, we are extremely pleased with performance of this coalition.", "Operating income for Outdoor & Action Sports was up 31% in the quarter and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 10.3%. We're hitting on all cylinders here. We improved gross margin. We increased the marketing ratio of revenues and improved our profitability. The focus of continuing investments that we're making behind these brands is truly paying off. For the full year, in Outdoor & Action Sports, we're now confident we'll grow at the upper end of our range of 12% to 13%.", "Now turning to Jeanswear, we did see the sequential improvement we expected, with revenues down 1% compared to a 4% decline in the first quarter. And actually Jeanswear revenues were up slightly on a constant dollar basis. In the Americas region, revenues were down in the low single-digit percentage range, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the US mid-tier channel and shifting consumers trends in the women's denim. And as you heard earlier, this environment had the biggest impact on the Lee brand in the US.", "In Europe, our Jeanswear business saw continued strength with revenues up at a mid-teen percentage rate, while revenues in the Asia-Pacific region rose in the low single-digit range. Second half revenues in Asia are expected to grow at a high-teen percentage rate. Operating margin for the coalition in the quarter was down 130 basis points due to the proactive efforts to ensure inventories stay in line that I mentioned earlier.", "As we look toward the back half of the year, we expect Jeanswear revenues to turn positive, with the strongest growth coming in the fourth quarter when the benefit of expanded distribution kicks in and several new product innovations are launched.", "Imagewear revenues grew 3%, driven by mid single-digit growth in the Image or Workwear business. And our [ph] LSG business was up at a low single-digit rate. As you recall, we talked about our decision to license the youth business for Major League Baseball. This negatively impacted Imagewear second quarter topline by 2 percentage points, but will lead to better profitability in the long term. Operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year due to a shift in product mix isolated to the second quarter. We continue to expect this coalition's full year operating margin to expand.", "Sportswear coalition revenues were up 5% during the second quarter. Nautica revenues were up 2%, which is lower than what we had anticipated. In Nautica, a low double-digit increase in D2C was tempered by a mid single-digit decline in the wholesale business due to the same department store challenges that you're all aware of. Kipling's US business delivered another outstanding performance with 18% growth in the quarter, a brand that on a global basis was up 27%. Operating margin in our Sportswear coalition was 7.3%. We expect the coalition's full year operating margin to be about flat with last year.", "In our Contemporary brands business, revenues declined 2% with similar decreases in both the Americas and European businesses. Our D2C business was up 10%, but this was offset by a high single-digit decline in the wholesale business, reflecting the challenging consumer trends in the women's premium denim. As we said last quarter and similar to Imagewear, we decided to move part of our kids business to a license model. That negatively impacted revenues for this coalition in the quarter by 3 percentage points.", "And finally related to our balance sheet, we did purchase an additional 2.9 million shares for $173 million in the second quarter, which concluded our planned share buyback anticipated for 2014. We continue to expect another really strong year from a cash generation standpoint, which should exceed $1.65 billion, allowing us to completely repay our commercial paper balance by yearend and providing us great flexibility to invest in future growth.", "Now with respect to our outlook for the full year, as you've heard throughout the day, we believe we're right on track to achieve our targets. We expect annual revenues to be up 8%, which is directly in line with the organic growth expectation of our 2017 plan. Full year gross margin and operating margin should reach 49% and 15% respectively, which would be ahead of the pace anticipated for reaching our 2017 goals. Earnings per share in 2014 is expected to reach $3.06 per share, which is up 13% over 2013, right in line with our 2017 plan.", "And finally, we will keep an opportunistic view and looking for areas to invest in our brands, products and marketing to provide further momentum going into 2015 and beyond. And now I'll give a little bit of color on how we see growth trending in the second half.", "Third quarter revenue should increase at a rate similar to that of the second quarter, driven primarily by strength within our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, our international operations and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer businesses. Investments in the third quarter, driven by a record number of store openings, will pay off significantly in the fourth quarter. That means of course that the strongest growth and profitability comparisons of the year will be in the fourth quarter when our direct-to-consumer business has its most significant contribution of the year.", "So in closing, we've had a great first half of 2014, growing revenues by 7% and earnings per share by 13%. We're set up well for an even stronger second half of the year. Our portfolio is strong. We have many opportunities to create even greater separation from the competition. 2014 will be a year when we'll make significant gains in improving our profitability and enhancing long-term shareholder value. In summary, we're very confident in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook.", "With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we can open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "So, Eric, on the consumer, curious how you described the overall environment out there today. Any changes in ordering trends that you've seen and expectation for the promotional environment in the second half versus what we're seeing out there today?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. On the US front, it's pretty obvious. By the promotional activity that you're seeing at retail today that consumers are tough to get at. We're seeing that in our wholesale business, not so much in our direct-to-consumer business where our business was up in single digit in our own stores in the quarter. But in our departments that we sell to have adopted a more promotional environment and we see that affect us primarily in our Sportswear and in our Jeanswear business, particularly in the mid-tier, not so much an issue anywhere else in the corporation though and not an issue for us international at all. So where that affects us is in a very small sliver of our business and we're finding consumers are coming to our brands in other channels of distribution, including our own.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "And then as you think about the promotional environment in the second half, I mean are you kind of planning for it to be as it is today or do you think that things will actually calm down a little bit here?", "Eric Wiseman", "I wish I knew the answer to that. But we're prepared for it to be as it is today.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "And then on the balance sheet, you leveraged in about levels when you acquired Timberland. Buyback is now complete. It doesn't sound like there is an acquisition eminent. Can you just talk about capital allocation priorities going forward here?", "Eric Wiseman", "Our capital allocation, the way we look at it is it's pretty much exactly where we've been. Our first priority is in the M&A front. It's been very, very successful for us. Our buyback program will remain pretty much the same. You said the program is complete is for the year, just to clarify that, where we said was for 2014 we weren't anticipating buying back any further shares. But going forward, we will. And we'll use that to offset the impact of stock option exercises. So yeah, our priorities are very clear. And that is on the M&A front, the buyback program is more of a maintenance level spend. And actually from a dividend standpoint, in 2014, we'll expect to increase our dividend substantially, once again just as we have over the past couple of years, is likely by more than 20%, just like we did last year, moving toward that ultimate goal of 40% payout level.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America", "Hey, just two questions. The first was just on that Jeanswear business. Maybe, Karl Heinz, you could tell us how did Lee do the 25% growth in the second quarter, and is that sort of a trend that we should expect to continue? And then maybe in aggregate, could you give us a little more help on what the Jeanswear margin outlook is? I understand how you protected the margin downside in the second quarter. But how should we think about Jeanswear gross margins? And maybe some color on just the third quarter versus fourth quarter gross margins to get to your full year guidance.", "And my second question is just on the Timberland business. Maybe some comment on how that operating margin in that business is tracking versus your plan of the revenue look great, but is the margin also doing what you guys are hoping it's going to do?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "So, Robbie, let me start with your first question. The 25%, as we mentioned, it's an exception number. It's not a number which normally the jeans sector is delivering going forward. What I would say though is we have done a great work. We had a good Q1. We expect a good year and we do expect finally our jeans business in Europe going back to growth again.", "Eric Wiseman", "And, Robbie, relative to the jeans gross margin percentage in the second half of the year, and this is a global view, the gross margins will return back pretty close to where we've been. So actually on a full year basis, our gross margins will be relatively flat year-over-year. Just to clarify, in the second quarter, I mentioned in my comments that we took some proactive actions to control inventory and we took some downtime in our plans. And again, we're in a unique position to do that and we could really see it in our inventories. And our inventories are really under good control. We just didn't want to go into the second half of the year with any kind of inventory positions that were in excess. So that was the biggest on the gross margins in jeans. So yeah, that'll improve in the second half of the year, so the overall on an annual basis will be pretty close year-over-year.", "Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America", "And just on the cadence of the third quarter overall gross margin versus the fourth quarter, we should assume gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter?", "Eric Wiseman", "Absolutely. But obviously stronger in the fourth quarter, given the mix of D2C.", "Bob Shearer", "I'll go back to the acquisition assumptions. Obviously when we talked about Timberland acquired, we talked about a 10% annual growth rate. We're running ahead of that this year. Certainly ahead of it in the second quarter, but the guidance we've given for Timberland is for 12% global growth this year. From an operating margin standpoint, we're on track to hit the targets we set when we acquired the business. And we're going to give an awful lot of color about that to you guys in a few months.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie", "I have a few questions with regards to the anticipated September Investor Day, which will focus on the Timberland brand. With the brand growing at a high-teen rate now, could we expect revised 2017 targets for the brand? Could we see gross margin operating margin goals as well? And lastly, does the success around the Timberland acquisition give you more confidence to make another potential acquisition revolving around the footwear line?", "Eric Wiseman", "We were going to go into details about where we are with Timberland and where we see it going when we're together in September. And that story needs to be put in the context of the total picture around the world is the only way to really tell that story. And in about eight weeks, we'll be going through that. We are very confident in our acquisition model. If you go back a decade ago, we bought Vans and 15 years ago we bought The North Face. And you go through the brands and in Bob's script, he mentioned that Napapijri, Kipling, EASTPAK and SmartWool all grew greater than 20% this past quarter. We think we're pretty capable acquirers and integrators and enablers of businesses in any category.", "Our interest in footwear is obviously growing. That really started for us with Vans and then followed by Reef and now Timberland. And we have other brands that are in the footwear business, but those two are really footwear acquisitions. We're a pretty big player in the space now and we have a lot of momentum in our footwear businesses. So yeah, that would lead us to believe that we could do another footwear acquisition. I'm not going to say that's our top priority, but we could do one, yes.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie", "And can you talk a little bit about the lucy brand, how it has performed over the last couple quarters? And then maybe bigger picture, if you could share your general thoughts on the yoga market, as we see some existing players struggle with new brands entering the space, any general insights would be greatly appreciated.", "Steve Rendle", "So our lucy business, a business we're very proud of, had a strong first half. We're up mid single-digit. Second quarter was off plan a little bit, primarily due to retail traffic trends in our own stores, which remain a significant part, about 75% of our total business. What we're really proud of with our lucy business is the partnership that they're forming with the exporting goods. As of the end of May, we had set a little over 300 doors in the new exporting goods women's studio pad and are seeing really strong results. That partnership is building on additional partnership we've had for just about two years with REI where we're an all-door provider and seeing really strong results there as well. So we're able to take our Outdoor & Action Sports model of a balanced wholesale and D2C strategy, bring that to lucy, extend the reach of our brand, touching consumers where they're shopping.", "As we look at this space, the women's athletic and yoga space, absolutely something we're interested in. We think it's in a sector that's here to stay and one that we can do very, very well with, with our unique ability to understand the consumer and bring products and emotional marketing to drive our success.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Could you help us put some numbers or some magnitude around the two impacts you mentioned on gross margin as far as factory downtime versus FX, Bob?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, maybe what I'll do is just run through the gross margin and the components of the gross margin in the quarter. So as we've very, very consistently said and as we've been saying and realizing the mix benefit was absolutely intact and will be for the year and will be going forward. That was about 70 basis points on the plus side. You might also remember the concession accounting change helped us by about 30 points and that increases SG&A as well by about the same. That's about 100 basis points.", "So offsetting those two in about equal amounts, number one was the FX impact. We talked about that in our last quarter and we could see that coming. By the way for the second half of the year, that won't be an issue. It's really isolated to the second quarter. That was about half of the offset. And then the other half was related to the inventory actions that we took. And a big piece of that was the downtime in the jeans plants that we talked about.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "So as far as second half goes, the jeans guidance, maybe you can help us think about how much of it is reflecting your expectation for improved sell-throughs or they're just new programs?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, it's particularly in the fourth quarter. I think Scott mentioned this in his comments. In the fourth quarter, it will be the strongest comparison as we gain some distribution and also the new product launches. So that will be the strongest quarter. From a gross margin standpoint, no, we don't expect to see the same impact that we saw in the second quarter. We feel that we have that clean-up behind us and we enter the year with really clean inventories going into the second half of the year.", "Scott Baxter", "Yeah, Michael, we feel real good about our core business going into the second half of the year, especially with where we are in the inventory position. But I think the big thing for us is the innovation that we've had in our pipeline that's now starting to come to life. You're going to see it in the mass channels as it rolls out right now with our Advanced Comfort. The best test that we've ever had in the history of Wrangler for a new product, we just nailed with that and it's gotten full distribution within the mass channel. And that's hitting right now. So we couldn't be more excited about that product and for when folks finally get a chance to buy it and wear it and the word of mouth.", "And then in the mid-tier, we're also doing the same with new products, Curvy Fit and Easy Fit. So that's really going to take hold as we move through the third quarter and it's really going to help us in the fourth quarter and going forward.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Last winter, obviously there was a lot of media around how cold the winter was and certainly we were all looking at the temperatures in the US. But you guys were pretty consistently commenting that it wasn't universal and that there were some areas, I think Lance called out California, but certainly Europe was an area where the winter wasn't as favorable as those of us watching the news in the US were saying. Could you just comment on how order trends are looking for The North Face or what the retailers are thinking about as they are sitting on inventory in Europe that you think might be holding them back from ordering stronger for the back half?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "We had a very strange winter in Europe. We had tons of snow in the Southern part of the Alps and we had no snow on the Northern side. So a pretty strange thing. I would say now the situation has normalized. And as we anticipated, we look forward on The North Face for a mid-single growth for the year. As you know, we don't announce fall orders anymore because of the strong D2C component we have. But we are looking forward to a good year.", "Now we have assumed a normal winter to come. So no spectacular at the same time hopefully not a bad one like this year. But we don't see the promotional activity as strong as what's happening here in the US at the moment. So I would say all in all, thanks God, we went over well and we look forward to a normal year.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our next question from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.", "Maddie Steiner - Nomura Securities", "This is actually Maddie Steiner on for Bob. I just have two quick ones. Firstly, can you talk about any visibility you have into the fall holiday pre-booking for the outdoor brand?", "Eric Wiseman", "We're not giving our forward-looking booking with The North Face for a couple of reasons. Probably most importantly is our D2C business is now about a third of our total revenue and trying to contrast our wholesale order book really isn't accurate depiction of what our business looks like. What I can tell you is our orders in hand support the outlook of a 12% global growth rate that Karl Heinz mentioned in his script. And here in the US, we're feeling very good about the momentum that we've carried out of '13 into '14 first half has been very strong. Our order trends for fall are in line with our guidance here in that low-teens growth rate for the US business.", "Maddie Steiner - Nomura Securities", "And then lastly, with regard to the Jeanswear inventory issues, was any of that related to Lee overhang in China that you've mentioned previously or has that been resolved?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "That has been resolved. In fact, we did announce a positive quarter for Lee this quarter. What I did mention in my script was the situation on outdoor. We see a similar situation happening in the outer channel, but this time we have proactively acted. And the fact what we have done, we have not delivered the entire order book we had, the spring order book to the market in order to avoid a similar situation.", "Steve Rendle", "And the inventory situation that we discussed was really around the Lee brand domestically. If you step back 10 feet and look at the Lee business, it is almost entirely in the mid-tier channel and it's tilted heavily towards women's, which is the weaker part of the jeans business. The channel choice we've made and who the brand resonates with women, you put those together and that's the softest part of our Jeanswear business in the world right now.", "Eric Wiseman", "We don't think the fundamental brand problem, it's more structural around it.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory", "Can you talk a little bit about the marketing investment plans going forward and what you see the cost as this year versus last year, how you're planning? And then anything on product cost and West Coast port strike, how you're planning? And just lastly, Europe strength, was it particular regions that you saw the strength?", "Bob Shearer", "What we indicated early in the year and we're right on track for the spend is that last year we spent just below 6% of our total revenues on marketing, spent close to $680 million or so. In the current year, we expect to keep our ratio about flat with what it was last year, again right under the 6% level, so if we're just well above $700 million mark, closer to $720 million or $730 million or up about $50 million over 2013. That's our plans right now. As I indicated in my commentary, if we see some opportunity to make some additional investments in marketing or other areas, just as we have in the past which have been very, very effective for us, we may do that. But our plan right now is to hold the ratio to revenues pretty flat and again close to the 6% mark.", "Eric Wiseman", "On the product cost side, Dana, I think the best way for you to think about that is we have complete visibility of our product cost for the balance of this year and we expect to deliver 40% gross margin for the company this year. So we've contemplated all the pluses and minuses in product cost into that 49% gross margin number. On the West Coast port strike, the good or whatever the situation is out there right now, we obviously saw that coming well in advance. Our supply chain reacted in a really strong way and we got inventory into our warehouses much earlier than we would otherwise have. And remember, our inventories were only up 6% at the end of the quarter. So they would have been even better than that had we not accelerated receipt of goods. So we're prepared to fill orders here in the third quarter. I can't predict what might happen out in the West Coast, but we have the inventory in our warehouses right now and hopefully that situation will get resolved.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "The fourth question, I guess, was on the stressed situation in Europe. So as I mentioned it before, we did not see, thanks God, what's happening here in North America. We have some markets, some countries, Europe is a conglomeration of markets, but overall I would say it's business as usual.", "Operator", "And now we'll move along to our next question from Omar Saad with ISI Group.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "My first question, following up on the jeans commentary, how do you think about this kind of divergence, especially with the Lee brand, how it's doing domestically versus international in this era of globalization and information availability and digital, just how do you think about the sustainability of those kind of diverging brand positions for the international versus domestic?", "Scott Baxter", "I think there is a big opportunity here for Lee. If you think about the brand, it's got permission to play in this space as far as comfort goes, and that's really where folks are going right now. And we're getting at it with a lot of new products in our innovation pipeline. You heard me talk about a few of them earlier. But they're starting to roll out now. And our team thinks of it as additional wearer occasions. We're the leading brand with our brands that we have in Lee and Wrangler. So the permission to plan that space and the footprint from a distribution standpoint that we have put us in a really strong position. And then the work that we can do globally together will really help us drive that around the globe. And it's part of the thing that makes V.F. great in that we work and communicate together as brands globally. We talk and communicate and we understand the trends that are happening globally and we share those together and we can work together to make sure that those brands are healthy and growing in the future.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Omar, as we discussed and as you know, we have pretty aligned on Lee and on Wrangler between Europe and Asia. So we're there. And globally, we're working closer and closer. Stretch fabric is a good come on that team on Lee, which we're using in US and in Asia and in Europe of course. So we're getting there to have common brand positioning.", "Eric Wiseman", "Omar, the challenge for us obviously is how do we recognizing that the brand was a pioneer internationally, just celebrated its 50th anniversary of doing business in Europe. And back when it was launched in Europe, it didn't have to look consistent globally, because there wasn't global communication, but today there is. And we're undergoing a lot of efforts to gradually, but deliberately find common ground for this brand around the world. That will take time, but we're on it and it's going to take time. There're a lot of little steps. We're moving closer. And the strange thing about that to me is here in the United States, the Lee brand in Europe looks like it has a premium positioning. But sitting in Europe, it does not have a premium position. It's just relative to American price points. In Europe, it's really more of a mid-tier positioning, which is right where it is in the United States from a price point standpoint.", "Scott Baxter", "And, Omar, I think one of the things that's really going to help us do that is we're opening up and we're in the process right now of opening up our denim innovation center and it's a global denim innovation center. And Karl Heinz and I are very aligned on what we need to do and what we need to accomplish there. And we're going to work on joint projects around denim and around our products going forward. So there is a lot of excitement around that and you'll hear more of that in future too.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "I also wanted to ask about Timberland, kind of a follow-up. I mean this was the biggest acquisition you've done. The margin opportunity you guys have obviously executed really well. But now this thing is growing in the teens, high-teens even. And it was already such a big brand when you bought it. Like how much confidence does the topline success you're having with this brand, a few years removed from the deal, to do other even larger acquisitions in the future? Is that something you think about?", "Eric Wiseman", "We obviously are in a different place than we were 10 years ago when we talked about having a sweet spot for acquisitions of $300 million or $400 million. We are a much bigger company now. We were $4 billion or $5 billion company then. We're a $12 billion company now. We need to be looking at larger opportunities for acquisitions to move the needle. Does it mean we wouldn't do a smaller deal if it was a really smart business that we thought that if we bought we could do with that, like we've done with a lot of the other smaller businesses we bought and grow them and expand their profitability and deliver great shareholder value. But given our current size, we're capable of doing bigger deals. Given our current annual cash flow, we're capable of doing bigger deals. And something like Timberland gives us confidence that we could do it well too, that's fair.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our next question from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA", "Can you talk about the China opportunity, where are you versus your projected trajectory? And then second, could you comment on the acceptance of the re-launched Timberland apparel that we saw I think about a year ago? What have you learned, what have you changed, et cetera?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yeah. The big picture on our China trajectory is that we are essentially on track. There've been some puts and takes and there always are going to be in a business that has a diverse portfolio. But in terms of our aiming and the China targets we've talked about, we're still aiming and we're making progress.", "Steve Rendle", "So the limited re-launch of the Timberland apparel was here in the United States. Our most significant apparel business is sitting in Europe and Asia. We brought the apparel back here to the US last year. It was a strategic limited launch with a small number of specialty retailers as well as Nordstrom. We saw very good results, very good sell-through. That momentum carried into spring, as I mentioned in my comments. And our order book for fall '14 reflects that success, as we've seen in expansion of our specialty doors and expansion of the number of doors that we'll participating with Nordstrom on. And we're very happy. We are on track with what we believe this brand can do from a head-to-toe standpoint and we'll continue to drive apparel as part of that balanced portfolio of products that we're bringing to the outdoor lifestyle consumer.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "I just wanted you guys to maybe think a little bit more about your direct-to-consumer business, very strong in the quarter, up 18%. Could you just help us parse out the growth between e-commerce and then your brick and mortar stores? And then as you take a step back and think about the e-commerce goal you've provided for the longer-term plan of $750 million, where are you in achieving that, and then how are you seeing the role of mobile kind of impact the pathway to get there?", "Eric Wiseman", "We had a really nice quarter in our direct-to-consumer business. Let's keep in mind that the second quarter is not the biggest quarter for an Outdoor & Action Sports type business to have in our D2C world. But we have a consistent string here of really strong quarters. We're up 18%. We have double-digit growth in every region and growth in nearly every brand. What makes that up is a mid single-digit comp store growth, which we're proud of, over 30% growth in our e-commerce. And we are on track to open 150 new stores this year. So there is a new store component, we've said all along. And we are very early in our journey of opening up our own stores. Because we have so many brands and so many geographies that we're in, we have a lot of runway to open new stores and we said we're going to open 150 this year and less than half of them are opened as we sit here today, but they'll be opened by the end of the year. And that's part of what gives us confidence about the strength we're going to have in the second half of the year.", "On mobile, we are beginning to activate our brands, so the consumers can relate to our brands through their mobile devices. We're not where we want to be. I think in general, the industry didn't see mobile coming on as big as we could. I'm going to ask Steve to make a comment on that, about where we are.", "Steve Rendle", "So, Erinn, this last March, our Vans business launched a new V.F. platform for our web businesses going forward. It has a very powerful adaptive responsive mobile component to that. We certainly see our consumers interacting with us on mobile, searching out our products and our content. But we also see mobile as a very critical tool of how we interact with our consumers in-store, and we're making investments in that part of our digital platform as well as bringing service and efficiency to that in-store component. So a very, very important and an area that our big brands are driving very aggressively and will benefit all of the V.F. platform in the future.", "Eric Wiseman", "And, Erinn, just one other point relative to D2C, our profitability as well has been very, very strong and our returns are high in our D2C businesses in total. And they're even improving. Some of that's coming from improvement on the international side, where our business was less mature and is now maturing, it's improving and also the fact that on the e-comm side of the business, which is highly profitable, becomes a little bit bigger piece of the overall mix. So a good news there as well.", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "And I guess it just the last question just for Karl Heinz, just a follow-up for you. You responded to an earlier question just speaking about the inventory starting to build in the channel for outdoor brands in Asia and that kind of led to you proactively pulling back on The North Face orders there. Can you just speak to when did you start kind of seeing this inventory build in the space there, and then how should we think about kind of the next few quarters in terms of rightsizing where you want to be? And the inventory there, seeing the channel, I guess just the last question is, are you seeing that more from global brands that are expanding in Asia or from some of the local brands?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, we mentioned we had a similar situation with Lee a while ago, as you might well recall. And we're kind of [ph] cocked by that and we suffered then. We had a few quarter where we had negative growth. This time, we changed our strategy. We saw it coming. And as I mentioned before, we did not deliver our full order book, the order book we had, for spring into the market to avoid exactly a similar situation. In fact, I also mentioned we do expect the second half to grow on The North Face in China, probably stronger in Q4 than Q3. So the situation normalizing.", "China, I always mention China is a marathon. There will up and down, but we have great opportunities in that market. We are acting only with four brands at the moment directly and we have relatively low penetration in terms of distribution. We are engaged in the higher tiers. So there's still a long runway to cover. I'm not sure I've covered all your requests. Do you have other questions or did I give you an answer?", "Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, just in terms of kind of where you are seeing that inventory build. Is it really across more of the global brands that are expanding in China in the outdoor market, or is it some of the local brands that you are seeing that pressure?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Well, it's kind of both. Everybody has an appetite to succeed in China. As you know, the market is very fragmented. There're a couple of hundreds of outdoor brands, global brands, local brands, regional brands. So it might change over time, but I would say it's coming from every side at the moment.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our next question from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird", "A few questions. One, I just was hoping you could reconcile a few things on the sales side. I know in the quarter, going into it you were expecting sales to be up around 6.5% like the first quarter. They definitely came in better than that. So I was just kind of curious where you saw the upside. I would guess it was on the Outdoor & Action Sports side, but I think Scott also said that jeans were also a little bit better. And then two, with sales coming in better in Q2, I'm a little surprised you didn't take up the sales guidance for the year. So I was hoping you could address that. Are you just being conservative on the back half? And then three, on sales. It looks like your Outdoor & Action Sports guidance is now at the high end of 12% to 13%. I think previously you were just saying 12% to 13%. So I'm just wondering what's changed there. It didn't sound like you adjusted any of your expectations for your three main brands there.", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah, where we've seen the strength is primarily in Outdoor & Action Sports. I don't think that's any surprise to any of you. And those three big brands, you're absolutely right, in The North Face, Vans and Timberland, all performed really, really strongly. And in the first half, actually a little bit better than we expected. So it has been a little bit stronger. In the second quarter, it was particularly strong. And we also have a very, very strong growth plan for the second half for those businesses in total for Outdoor & Action Sports. And our plans there at this point in time are right in line with our initial plans and our initial guidance around the strength of our Outdoor & Action Sports business.", "And yes, to your point, with the current trends that we're seeing, with the growth rates of the first half, it would indicate that it could be a little bit better in Outdoor & Action Sports. But we have two very big quarter ahead of us, particularly on the outdoor brands. And North Face and Timberland, as you know, are very much heavily weighted to the second half of the year. So yeah, it could be a little bit better. But I think the bottomline here is we're looking forward to a very, very strong second half, just as we saw in the first half.", "And the 12% to 13%, yeah, what we're seeing is that is where the strength has been. The strength of our business clearly has been in the Outdoor & Action Sports base. And as we saw the results of the first half of the year, we have strengthened our expectations around that to the 13% level. So it does continue to strengthen somewhat.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yeah, Mitch, I'm just going to weigh in on this one too, because it's an interesting question, one that we've talked a lot about in the last several weeks, because clearly we have momentum. I used the word momentum early in my prepared comments, because we have it. And we have it in abundance in Outdoor & Action Sports across a whole bunch of our brands. So sitting with that momentum and that trend and the confidence we have about fall, the questions are two. How are our consumers going to shop this holiday season? And what kind of weather are we going to get? And that's why we're sticking with the guidance we have. No one knows the answers to the second two questions. But we're confident we can hit the guidance we've given for the year on the revenue basis. And as Bob said, it might be a little bit better if those two unknowns bless us with the positive positioning. But we don't know that, so we're going to stick to right to where we are for now.", "Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird", "And then just a quick follow up. Eric, you mentioned 150 stores this year. Bob talked about record store openings in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering from a square footage standpoint, I don't know if you can talk about this, but how much square footage do you think you could pick up in the fourth quarter on your stores? I mean is it somewhere in the 10% range? I'm just wondering how much of a driver of D2C growth square footage is expected to be.", "Eric Wiseman", "We don't look at square footage, but the only way you might think about that is we ended last year with around 1,250 stores. We expect to end this year with around 150 more. So you could do some rough math, assuming they are of the same size as average. But that's the only way I can guide you on how you might think about that.", "Steve Rendle", "Mitch, our overall store openings for the year will probably be maybe 30 higher on that basis versus last year. But we have such differences in the size of the stores with our individual brands, it's really hard to talk about the square footage.", "Eric Wiseman", "But what is different this year is about half of our openings are international. We've really got momentum in our direct-to-consumer capabilities around the world, stronger than it has ever been. Karl Heinz and his team have been working for a long time to really improve our capabilities there. And those stores tend to be a little bit smaller than domestic stores, particularly in Asia. So they're probably going to be smaller than average, half of it.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to our next question from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citi", "I had a question on The North Face and the supply chain. I know over a year ago that you had changed over two lines, I think, in some of your owned manufacturing towards The North face. I wondered if there had been any other changes made to the supply chain with regards to this brand this year and can we anticipate any change in terms of deliveries or how you are approaching retail in winter 2014?", "Eric Wiseman", "We saw really good results last year when we moved some of our fleece production into our jeans facilities in Central America. We saw an improvement in speed for sure, but also we were able to really see some positive product cost improvements. That success and the assurance of continued quality will continue to move those types of items into our jeans production when those lines become available, really looking to leverage the expertise and strength of our supply chain and do that very strategically where we have needs and opportunities to really drive speed for The North Face business here domestically.", "Kate McShane - Citi", "And then my second question was on the Lee introduction into Macy's in the fall. Can you tell us a little bit about the presentation of the brand at that retailer and how it might look different?", "Scott Baxter", "It certainly does. So, Kate, we took the Lee brand into Macy's and it's actually been in the department store channel for a little while with Belk and it's called Lee Platinum and it's a little bit more upscale with a little bit more decoration, some different washes, some different fabrics, a little bit high end on the fabrics. And we are expanding our store base in the department store channel right now, and it continues to go very well. We're pleased with how we're doing. We think there's really a big upside here going forward with the Lee Platinum label. And all plans are tracking on progress right now.", "Kate McShane - Citi", "Is there a lot of distinct fixturing associated with Lee Platinum? Can you find it in its own section or is it just amongst denim within Macy's?", "Scott Baxter", "It is amongst denim in Macy's and there's some distinct fixturing and some call out, but obviously we have to work with our partners on the in-store fixturing, as you know.", "Operator", "And we'll move along to our final question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel", "A couple questions from me, Bob, first for you. I just want to make sure I am clear on the gross margins. Was the pressure on constant currency gross margins confined to the Jeanswear and Sportswear business or is there promotional activity you are seeing across the other coalitions as well?", "Bob Shearer", "Are you talking about the FX impact?", "Jim Duffy - Stifel", "No, I am talking about constant currency gross margins. You called out some promotional activity. You also spoke to downtime in the factories. If we were looking at the P&L for the coalitions, was the gross margin pressure that you saw relative to your expectations confined to Jeanswear and Sportswear?", "Bob Shearer", "Right, from the standpoint of the proactive inventory adjustments and that kind of thing, it was mostly Jeanswear and some Sportswear. It's mentioned the constant currency. What I said was that half of the offset to the mix benefit was related to FX and of course it is the transaction side and the hedging activity, that kind of thing, which was isolated to the quarter. And that extended obviously pretty much throughout the international business. But yes, the remainder of the other half is mostly Jeanswear and some Sportswear.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel", "Second question I guess for Eric, maybe Steve relating to Vans. Momentum tremendous. What's the strategy to keep the Vans brand from overheating and perhaps being a transient fashion phenomenon?", "Steve Rendle", "I would tell you what I think the Vans team is the primary driver of that sustainable growth pack. They're very, very mindful about their product segmentations, the partners that they work with and how they sell in seasonal initiatives. Here in the US, which I can speak to directly, through their go-to-market process, looking at these really creative collaborations coupled with just normal seasonal product releases, they stay very on top of who they partner with, what they're selling in and really managing that growth on a long-term view.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "I mentioned that in my quote, it's very important point you touched. I think what gives us confidence, I mentioned that in China, not only the footwear growth, but also apparel and also accessories. And the same we are very careful in Europe. We had a peak and a heated situation in the UK, but we immediately managed the brand and invested in the brand in different European markets. And we see the brand now very strong in most of the European markets actually. So we're very careful and prudent.", "Eric Wiseman", "Jim, at the risk of piling on, Steve's comment about how thoughtful the Vans team is about making sure the quality of our growth is strong is absolutely spot on. You might be interested in knowing that most of the conversations we have about the Vans brand are about how underdeveloped we are geographically, underdeveloped on the East Coast, underdeveloped in Midwest, underdeveloped in the Southeast of this country, underdeveloped in Europe, just getting started in Asia, launched in Korea two years ago. So when we look at the future of the Vans brand, most of our discussions are about at what pace do we continue our march around the world with this brand. We see a lot of runway.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any closing or additional remarks.", "Eric Wiseman", "Again, thanks for your time today. As many of you said, we had a really strong second quarter and I hope you understand that we're really confident about the end of this year. The back half is shaping up quite nicely and we'll all confident that we can deliver what's in our guidance and hope to see you in September. Take care.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please go ahead sir.", "Lance Allega ", "Thank you operator, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on the call to discuss VF's third quarter 2014 results. ", "Before we begin I'd like to remind everybody that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "Participants may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, which was issued at 7 AM Eastern Time and on our website at vfc.com.", "Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO; and VF Executives, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. Following our prepared remarks we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thank you and now, I'll turn the call over to Eric.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our strong third quarter results demonstrate the value creating strength of VF\u2019s growth strategy. Our unique ability to form deep connections with consumers is led by an impressive array of innovative products, powerful brands and authentic retail experiences. ", "VF\u2019s achievements are the by-product of our relentless focus on creating, connecting and ultimately generating great value for our consumers, customers and our shareholders. Total VF revenues in the third quarter were up 7%, which included a bit of a foreign currency headwind. Yet despite this we\u2019re right on track to achieve our full year growth expectation of an 8% increase. ", "Performance during the quarter was once again led by the Outdoor & Action sports coalition which was up 11%. Our three big brands continued their strong momentum. The North Face was up 9%, Vans grew 12%, and Timberland was up 15%. And especially important result coming off of last month\u2019s Timberland Investor Day where we detailed plans for the brand to reach $3.1 billion in revenues by 2019. ", "And to spend a minute on Timberland I\u2019d underscore once again just how proud we are of the work we\u2019ve accomplished during the past three years and the important momentum we\u2019ve established. Such strong momentum that today we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019re taking up our 2014 revenue growth outlook for the Timberland brand to 13%, a rate directly in line with their new five year growth target. ", "A powerful brand, innovative product and global growth, built on a strategy supported by consumer insights. Timberland is a perfect example to illustrate the power of our one VF approach to business. ", "Turning to another highlight of the third quarter, our direct-to-consumer business also continued to build on strong momentum with revenues up 16% including increases in all VF brands with retail operations. And our international business was up 9% or 10% in constant dollars with EMEA and Asia Pacific regions on track to reach their full year goals. ", "Gross margin for the quarter improved 70 basis points to 48.3% driven by the continuing shift of our revenue mix toward higher margin businesses. Operating margin for the third quarter was up 40 basis points to 18% reflecting our disciplined balance of investments and underlying operational leverage. And all of this helped to deliver an 11% increase in earnings per share to a $1.08 for the third quarter. ", "This strong result and the confidence that we have as we look to wrap up 2014 led us to increase our full year EPS expectation to $3.08 per share, a number that includes a negative impact from foreign currency and additional marketing investments, components that Bob will provide more detail on in his comments. ", "I would like to also provide some additional insight to our strong performance during the quarter, our global supply chain organization continues to do an extraordinary job managing our sourcing relationships and getting our products to market. Ahead of our biggest revenue growth quarter of the year our inventories are only up 4%, a significant accomplishment in light of the current business environment and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll service our customers at a very high level. ", "As you\u2019d expect VF continues to sharply focus on returning cash to shareholders. Today we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend lifting it to $0.32 per share which along with our stock buyback will return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders by the end of this year. Before I wrap up my comments a few words about our sustainability-related activities. This is an essential part of VF\u2019s core values and we view it as an opportunity to help shape the sustainability agenda in the apparel and footwear industry. ", "Next week VF will publish our sustainability and responsibility report that outlines our ongoing activities, aspirations, goals, measureable achievements and performance targets. I encourage you to review our story as we further develop and extend our global capabilities and accomplishments.", "So to sum it up our strategy to drive near and long-term value to shareholders is working well. We continue to inspire consumers with innovative products and deepen our relationships with them. We continue to leverage our best-in-class platforms to fuel growth across our strong portfolio of brands. Given our ability to leverage our scale, financial resources and operational disciplines we have a unique competitive advantage even in the face of a challenging global economic environment and a highly competitive retail landscape.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve, Karl, Heinz and Scott to review our brands. Bob will then walk you through the financials. So Steve over to you.", "Steve Rendle", "", "Thanks, Eric. In line with our expectations third quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 9%, setting a solid base for accelerated growth in the fourth quarter. The brand\u2019s D2C business was especially strong in the quarter with a 32% increase in revenues, which along with a sequential acceleration in our wholesale business has us well positioned to deliver another record for The North Face. ", "In the Americas revenues were up at a low double-digit percentage rate with almost 30% growth in D2C and high single-digit growth in wholesale. On the product front our Mountain Athletics training collection led a 60% comp increase in our performance apparel sales with our own D2C. We see this momentum carrying through fall-winter season as well in to next year when we will extend this line to include women\u2019s products.", "Ultra footwear is also a strong performer, winning awards from both the running and outdoor industries and during the quarter our daypack sales at wholesale were up significantly with a 35% increase. We are also really pleased with the great early season response to ThermoBall, TNF's industry leading transitional outerwear product. ThermoBall has been a top five selling outerwear star every week this year. And further proof that our innovation engine is creating revolutionary breakthrough product, FuseForm has won six major product innovation awards around the world including Outside Magazine\u2019s Gear of the Year in their Winter buyer\u2019s guide. ", "This fall we will drive bold and impactful messaging, amplifying our story telling with consumers, centered around the spirit of exploration and connecting people to our featured product initiatives like ThermoBall and Mountain Athletics we will continue to increase brand visibility and drive growth.", "We are also set to launch a new North Face TV campaign in the U.S. in the early November, using short and long form spots as well as digital display and social media components. This brand campaign highlights the inspirational and emotional reasons to explore the outdoors. There are a lot of exciting things in store for The North Face this fall.", "Now let me turn it over to Karl Heinz to walk you through TNF's result in Europe and Asia.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. In Europe, The North Face revenues increased at the low single-digit rate. Our wholesale business was essentially flat due to a combination of a sluggish outdoor retail environment and a shift in the timing of product shipments into the fourth quarter. However our D2C business was up nearly 30% in the quarter emphasizing the strength of the brand.", "On the product side, our ThermoBall collection continued to perform strongly supported by marketing campaign across Europe. We also successfully tested our Mountain Athletics collection in a number of stores and have plans to roll-out this product much more broadly moving forward. ", "I am also incredibly excited about the investments we are making in our European footwear business, including our new [hatch work] collection and our first ever European designed Mountain trail running shoe which will launch in Spring \u201915. So far we have seen strong initial selling of those products, and our partners are just as excited as we are.", "In Asia, revenues were up at the mid-single digit rate. We are seeing an improving inventory situation in China, a trend that sets up for significant growth in the fourth quarter. The ThermoBall launch was received very well by Chinese consumers. It was supported by an integrated activation campaign which included TV and Online ads.", "We featured product at more than 450 partner locations. We have meaningfully moved this product front and center to the Chinese consumers\u2019 mind. Globally TNF had a solid third quarter. We expect the fourth quarter\u2019s growth rate to be in line with our long term target of 12% which puts us on track to achieve our \u201914 target.", "Now let\u2019s look at Vans.", "Steve Rendle", "Global revenues for the Vans brand in the third quarter were up 12%, marking the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, that\u2019s five years or half the time this brand has been in V.F.\u2019s portfolio, truly amazing. And certainly a testament to our global team that has proven they know how to connect with their consumer, create the product they demand and stay true to the brand\u2019s iconic off-the-wall DNA. With an 18% increase in the global D2C business and a high single-digit increase in the wholesale channel in the quarter Vans is solidly on track to become V.F.\u2019s second $2 billion brand.", " ", "In the Americas, revenues increased at a high single-digit rate. Fourth quarter revenues should be up a high-teen percentage rate, smoothing out the second half growth rate. This is exactly on track for the Vans Americas business being up at a mid-teen rate for the full year. ", "Let\u2019s talk about product. We kicked off the quarter with an exciting collaboration with Star Wars for both footwear and apparel. Based on this presence at retail and in digital media it helped to increase our core consumer awareness by 7% in North America. We launched a targeted women\u2019s campaign, Be the Original which offered our female consumers more fashion forward styles in our original slip-on silhouettes. We also enhanced our four season focus by introducing our weatherized product line across apparel and footwear.", "The globally relevant footwear products are designed to keep you warm and dry through a combination of water repellent uppers, insulated linings in a reverse [waffle-out sole] to enhance traction in cold and wet environments. Early sell-through across all regions has exceeded expectations. In our efforts to connect even deeper with consumers we just wrapped up the 20th year of the Vans Warped Tour with a meaningful attendance increase over last year\u2019s edition and continuing its tenure as the largest and longest running music festival in America.", "We also hosted our second U.S. Open of surfing which drew more than 750,000 people and 1.4 million visitors who tuned in online and through social media. This event has quickly become a centerpiece of surf, skate, and street culture, an inclusive environment that we are truly honored to be part of.", "We\u2019re also set to kick-off the next phase of our Living off the Wall campaign with all new interactive content and videos. If you haven\u2019t, I encourage you to check out the incredibly inspiring stories about what it means to live an expressive creative lifestyle, a very representative deep dive into our global core consumer. Connecting with consumers, innovative and authentic product and an amplified D2C presence, universally our growth engine is firing on all cylinders. [Karl]?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "In Europe revenue grew at the mid-teens rate with D2C growth of 25% and the low double-digit increase in the wholesale business. During the quarter we also launched weatherized products, an initiative that is particularly important for Europe and so far we are very pleased with the early results. We also launched our Footwear Plus concept stores in London and Rome which feature a footwear focused assortment with complementary accessories in a much smaller more efficient footprint.", "These stores are showing strong early results and we plan additional rollouts in key markets to drive geographic expansion and brand visibility. In addition to footwear our apparel and accessories categories also showed strength. I am proud to report that the August opening of our first European House of Vans in London exceeded our expectations. In the nine weeks since the opening of this location we are overwhelmed with enthusiasm and energy that this unique venue and experience has created. It\u2019s truly an amazing experience that we highly recommend.", "In Asia Vans revenue grew nearly 40% with China increasing more than 40, so strength across the board. We\u2019re also seeing strong results in apparel and footwear. Highlights in footwear include our Hero product stores in Sussex for Liberty, Star Wars and Hello Kitty collaborations. We also bring the House of Vans concept to Asia through mobile popup events in key markets like Shanghai and Seoul.", "The third quarter proved yet again that Vans brand is at the center of action sports art, music and street culture. We look forward to a strong finish to the year. ", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Timberland.", "Steve Rendle", "As Eric mentioned we are incredibly proud of what Timberland has achieved during the past three years and have tremendous confidence in our ability to reach $3.1 billion in revenues by 2019. But first back to 2014 in what\u2019s turning out to be an exceptionally strong first year of the new five year plan, so good in fact that we now expect 13% revenue growth this year, right in-line with our long-term target. Third quarter global revenues were up 15% driven by 18% wholesale growth and a 6% increase in D2C. We\u2019re focusing on Timberland's consumer using findings from our extensive insights research; we're delivering relevant products, connecting with consumers where they live and play and amplifying their experience at retail.", "As you saw at the recent Timberland Investor Day the resulting top line momentum and clear product and brand definition is now powerfully coming to market. In the Americas, revenues were up 22% driven by more than 30% growth in the wholesale business. This growth, similar to the second quarter was very balanced across all products and channels. We saw broad based sell-through of our classic boots and casual shoes and our Pro-Line continued its strong momentum, particularly with the Boondock Family of Boots and our newly launched Power Train collection.", "On the apparel side we continue to expand our distribution and see strong sell-through as our fall 2014 collection hits retail floors across our own and wholesale partner doors. As you saw at our Investor Day, Timberland's highly successful Best Then, Better Now campaign continues to play a critical role in reinforcing the brand as a stylish relevant outdoor lifestyle brand, focused on the outdoor lifestyler consumer segment the current campaign centers on a city outdoors, brand positioning using a combination of film, digital and print with the pinnacle print execution being a six page spread in GQ.", "Our style-driven content and storytelling is amplified through aggressive social and digital media programming and it is getting a great response from our consumers. ", "Now turning to our international business, Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's revenues in Europe were up 15% in the third quarter with balanced growth in both D2C and wholesale. This is the strongest third quarter performance the brand has seen in many years and gives us confidence to reach our future goals. To further drive connection with the European consumer we launched a new influential campaign in collaboration with one of Europe's leading youth media companies. This digital advertising campaign is built to drive relevancy and engagement with the European consumer. It highlights our apparel collection showing stylish and versatile full toe to head looks. We also celebrated the reopening of our flagship store on Regent Street in London. So great things ahead for that iconic retail location. ", "In Asia, third quarter revenues increased at the low single digit rate. We expect a meaningful acceleration of the business in the fourth quarter with a strong finish to the year. On the product side men's classic boots and boat shoes led the way in the quarter and apparel performed really well. What an exciting time for Timberland, our products have never been better or more clearly defined. We are connecting with consumers more directly than we ever have and we have high confidence that this brand will fulfill its goal of becoming the largest, most sustainable outdoor lifestyle brand on earth. ", "Now let's move to Jeanswear. Scott.", "Scott Baxter ", "Thank [Karl] and good morning everyone. Global revenues for the Jeanswear collection were up slightly in the quarter or up 2% in constant dollars. This is in line with what we spoke about in July and reflects continued sequential improvement. ", "During the third quarter global revenue for Wrangler increased 3% or 4% in constant dollars and revenues for the Lee brand were down 1% or flat in constant dollars. In the Americas, the Jeanswear business was down at a low single digit rate due to continued challenges in the U.S. mid-tier department store channel and continued trends in women's denim. Just like last quarter this mostly impacted the Lee brand. Revenues for Lee in the Americas were down 11%, were down 10% in constant dollars during the quarter, in a channel and category that remains challenged and while the overall market remains soft Lee\u2019s newly released products are resonating with consumers. ", "Our modern series Denim collection for men and the curvy fit series for women are seeing strong sell-through. And similarly within our mass channel we are very pleased with our early launch results for our Riders by Lee Heavenly Touch product which introduces the comfort of knit with durability of denim. ", "Turning to Wrangler\u2019s Americas business, revenues were up at a low single-digit rate or mid-single digit in constant dollars. This increase was driven by slight improvement in the mass business and a 10% increase in western sales and the strategies that I have discussed on the last several calls to expand our distribution and create additional demand with new products is playing out as we expected. Wrangler recently introduced Rock 47 which shakes up traditional western style for both ladies and men and the response thus far has been above expectation. ", "Test of our new performance denim line, Wrangler Cool Vantage have been producing strong results and we plan to roll it out more broadly over the next several quarters. ", "Overall we continue to face a pretty difficult environment in the Americas but we're weathering the storm with our brand strength intact by focusing on providing consumers with the innovative products they want, inspiring brand loyalty and tightly managing our inventories to ensure that we remain the best positioned in our industry. Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "Revenues for our international Jeanswear business grew more than 10% during the third quarter. In Europe Jeanswear revenues were down slightly due to mid-single digit decline in Wrangler\u2019s business partially offset by a modest increase in the Lee business. For the full year we expect our European Jeanswear business to be up at a mid-single digit rate, evidence that our strategy is working. ", "In Asia, revenues were up more than 30% led by balanced growth between the Wrangler and Lee brands. We are very pleased with the performance of Lee in Asia which posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth and is well positioned for continued success in this very important region. To sum it up we continue to make progress in our global Jeanswear business and we are where we thought we would be at this point in the year. As we look to finish the year we expect fourth quarter revenues to be up at the mid to single-digit rate. ", "Now Bob will take you through our financial highlights. ", "Bob Shearer ", "Thanks Karl Heinz. And so with three quarters of the year behind us not only has 2014 played out pretty much in line with how we expected it to, but we\u2019ve delivered this performance in an increasingly dynamic economic environment. Our consistent results reflect the strength of our powerful brands and platforms and our laser sharp focus on operational excellence.", "For the third quarter total VF revenues increased 7%, once again led by our Outdoor & Action Sports business, which grew 11%. The strong brands in this coalition continue to play a bigger role in the VF story. Our D2C business, which was up a robust 16% in the quarter including growth in all of our brands which have direct-to-consumer operations and our international business, which was up 9% or 10% in constant dollars with strong growth in both Europe and Asia. And with one quarter to go we have great confidence we\u2019ll achieve our 8% revenue growth outlook for 2014, right in line with our long-term financial target. ", "Our gross margin at 48.3% was 70 basis points higher than last year\u2019s same period. Our fastest growing platforms Outdoor & Action Sports, D2C and International also have our highest gross margins and they will continue to favorably impact our gross margin rate going forward. We continue to expect strong gross margin comparisons in the fourth quarter of the year when our gross margin rates should be up more than 100 basis points versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. ", "As we\u2019ve seen in prior years the significant growth in our direct-to-consumer business is a primary factor in driving this increase. Accordingly we expect our full year gross margin to approximate 49%. ", "Turning to the SG&A line, our SG&A rate was up a modest 40 basis points as compared to last year and this is despite the significant investments we continue to make in our D2C business. We have 131 more stores now than we did one year ago. ", "[inaudible] we continue to make meaningful investments in marketing our brands. In fact we now plan to spend an incremental $10 million behind our North Face and Vans brands in the fourth quarter. As you know, we\u2019ve done this in the past resulting in strong momentum heading into the following year. All-in our total marketing spend should increase by about $50 million in 2014 over 2013. Then also on the plus side, our investments in D2C drive up our SG&A ratio to revenues as our D2C businesses have a higher than average expense ratio but keep in mind our D2C business is also rewarded with a much higher gross margin than average resulting in a positive contribution to our operating margin.", "And then the final ingredient, we offset these investments with leverage from revenue growth throughout the remainder of our expense structure. That allows us to hold our overall SG&A ratio relatively flat, make the appropriate investments behind our businesses and grow our operating margins. That\u2019s how we will improve our operating margin in 2014 and for years to come. ", "And in fact, in the third quarter operating margin improved 40 basis points to 18% and earnings per share was up 11% to a $1.08. So now let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance in each of our coalitions beginning with our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, third quarter revenues grew 11% driven by a 20% increase in our D2C business and a high single-digit increase in wholesale sales. ", "By geography the growth was very balanced with a double-digit increase in all three regions. Aside from the North Face, Vans and Timberland, which as you\u2019ve heard delivered strong performances in the quarter. Kipling, Eagle Creek, Lucy and Eastpak also contributed strongly to the coalition\u2019s growth. And Timberland had a great quarter with 15% growth and continues to build on the brand\u2019s momentum that started in late 2013. In fact based on the strength of Timberland\u2019s year-to-date performance we now expect the brand to grow 13% in 2014, up from our previous outlook of 12% putting it right in line with this brand\u2019s 2019 expectation that we detailed at our Investor day last month.", "Operating income for Outdoor & Action Sports was up 13% in the quarter and operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 21.8%. This exceptional performance was driven by strong revenue growth and increased gross margin. We remain committed to putting the necessary resources behind these brands and expect to see continued positive comparisons. In addition, based on the coalition\u2019s strong third quarter performance, including Timberland\u2019s elevated outlook we now expect 13% revenue growth for this coalition in 2014. ", "Now turning to Jeanswear, revenues were up slightly and right in line with what we communicated in July. As expected overall revenue comparisons in this coalition are trending better. In the Americas region revenues were down at a low single-digit rate as the US mid-tier channel remains challenging and the unfavorable women's denim trend also continued to especially impact the Lee brand\u2019s U.S. business. ", "In Europe, Jeanswear revenues were down slightly, impacted by the timing of shipments with low single-digit growth in Lee revenues being offset by a mid-single digit revenue decline in Wrangler. In the Asia-Pacific region we saw significant acceleration in growth with sales up 30%. Operating margin for the coalition was down 30 basis points in a challenging retail environment.", "Looking forward for global Jeanswear we expect the improvement and comparisons to continue. As we look toward the fourth quarter we expect a mid to high single-digit percentage increase in our Jeanswear business driven by expanded distribution in the U.S. and the launch of several new product innovations. That should push global Jeanswear revenue comparisons to the plus side on a full year basis.", "Moving to Imagewear where revenues grew 3%, including 10% growth in our Workwear business and a mid-single digit rate decline in LSG. Now as a remainder we exited the unprofitable youth business for Major League Baseball. Excluding the youth business exit Imagewear revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Imagewear operating margin was up 40 basis points due primarily the higher volume and a favorable product mix. We continue to expect Imagewears revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate for the full year. ", "Sportswear coalition revenues grew 5% during the third quarter. Nautica revenues were up 2%, driven by a high single-digit increase in their D2C business. However, the brand\u2019s performance continues to be negatively impacted by the ongoing challenges for sportswear in the U.S. department store channel. Kipling\u2019s strong momentum continued into the third quarter with sales up more than 22% in the U.S. and up 20% on a global business. Operating margin in our Sportswear coalition was 14.1%.", "And then finally our Contemporary brands business saw a 5% decline in revenue with a low double-digit increase in our D2C business being offset by decline in our wholesale business as premium denim trends at department stores remained unfavorable. And as a reminder, the shift to licensing in our Splendid and Ella Moss children\u2019s business negatively impacted coalition revenue comparison by about two percentage points.", "Turning to our balance sheet, as a result of our strong operational discipline inventories were up just 4% in the third quarter and shifting gears a bit and related to our commitment to returning cash to shareholders we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share reflecting a 22% increase over the prior quarterly rate. Our dividend payout in 2014 should approximate 36%, representing great progress toward our longer-term goal of 40%. That means that our cash return to shareholders in 2014 including our dividend and our share buyback will be in excess of $1.2 billion. Our outlook for cash remains strong and we continue to expect cash generation in excess of $1.65 billion for the full year enabling us to completely pay down our commercial paper by year-end.", "Turning to the full year outlook, we continue to expect 8% revenue growth in 2014 right in line with our 2017 organic growth target. Gross margin and operating margin are expected to reach about 49% and 15% respectively, which puts us ahead of the pace we anticipated in our 2017 goals. And finally based on our strong fourth quarter\u2019s expectation our earnings per share in 2014 is now expected to reach $3.08 per share, an increase of $0.02 over the prior outlook representing 14% growth over 2013, again ahead of the annual pace in our 2017 or five year outlook. It\u2019s important to note that this increase to $3.08 includes and absorbs a $0.02 negative impact due to currency fluctuations since our prior guidance. We now assume a Euro to Dollar rate of 1.26 for the remainder of the year versus our previous assumption of 1.33.", "And so to wrap it up, we feel great about what we have accomplished so far in 2014. We are headed for another strong year of revenues and earnings growth now pointing toward 8% top line and 14% earnings gains. Our strong platforms are working and we\u2019ve never been more confident in our ability to sustain this exceptional performance.", "We look forward to wrapping up 2014 on a really positive note and laying out our plans for 2015 in our February call. And with that I will turn it back to the operator and we can open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question we\u2019ll hear from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "", "Hi, good morning.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Hey Bob.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "", "Eric, I guess couple of questions on, on the direct-to-consumer I think it was up 16% which is higher than the Group, are you seeing any signs of cannibalization versus the wholesale accounts, specifically in The North Face and Vans?", "Eric Wiseman", "", "No, Bob we are not. We are really proud of the performance of our D2C component, up 16% is strong. What\u2019s more important is what\u2019s beneath that. Our comps in our Brick and Mortar stores were up single-digits in the quarter and our e-com business was up 30% in the quarter and we don\u2019t see it affecting our wholesale business. Our wholesale business in brands like Timberland and North Face and Vans remains strong.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "", "Okay, and then I just had a question on the Jeanswear outlook. I was wondering Scott could you talk a little bit about the inventory levels, sort of the women\u2019s inventory levels and then within Lee in America and just comment on what\u2019s driving the expectation for I think it\u2019s mid to high single-digit increase in the Jeanswear coalition?", "Scott Baxter", "", "Sure Bob I would be happy to. So first you heard in Bob\u2019s presentation that we did a terrific job as a company with just a 4% increase in our inventories year-over-year with strong growth and actually the job that the Jeanswear team did on a full year basis quarter-to-quarter were down 4% year-over-year in our inventories from the actions that we took in the beginning half of the year that we shared with you. ", "I think the big thing that\u2019s driving our performance here in Q4 is a series of new product innovations and new product introductions. Curvy fit, Heavenly Touch, Easyfit modern series for men and women, advanced comfort, all of those things that have come to market here in the last couple of months and then continued to flow through the system here for the fourth quarter and going into next year. And then in addition to that and you have heard me talk a lot about channel distribution in our [where to plays] and we\u2019ve expanded that. For instance Wrangler is now in the mid-tier, Lee is now also in the department store channel. ", "So combining those efforts of those two things and really tight inventory management I think gives us good confidence for the fourth quarter.", "Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities", "", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Next we\u2019ll move to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "", "Hey, good morning. So you guys highlighted revenue shifts out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter at both North Face as well as Vans earlier on the call. Could you just elaborate a little on the magnitude and also speak to the goals behind the incremental $10 million marketing for North Face?", "Eric Wiseman", "", "So I will jump in on this one, from an Americas point of view in the North Face first we saw really strong Q2 mid-teen growth. We continue to see the momentum building against our 12 year growth for the year. We could not be more excited about the strong product stories, the Mountain Athletics and Ultra Footwear that pushed into spring and the big initiatives of ThermoBall and FuseForm for the second half supported by really bold and impactful messaging. ", "Our Vans business could not be stronger. We had a high teen growth rate in Q2. We see a high teen growth rate in Q4 that really flattens out and gets us to that mid-teen growth that we guided to for the full year. And again same messages in The North Face, really strong products. As we think about how to elevate classics through our collaborations, the apparel launch, that continues to gain momentum and then our weatherized footwear launch here in Q3 that really puts the Vans business on the map as a four season brand. ", "The North Face additional marketing that you referenced is really consistent with what we\u2019ve been doing the last two years and investing behind those brands with significant momentum. We\u2019re really excited about the TV campaign that The North Face will be launching here in the next week, what that means to the online digital push as well as supporting within the stores. So could not be more proud and confident with these two businesses. ", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Great and then Eric just a higher level question what are you seeing larger picture from a consumer perspective? Any view on the promotional landscape in the holiday and then more specifically any changes in forward-looking wholesale orders into next year that you\u2019ve seen so far?", "Eric Wiseman", "I won\u2019t talk about forward orders in to 2015, so I\u2019ll take that one off the table. We\u2019re seeing consumers -- everybody here is in the [resilience world], Matthew we\u2019re just seeing that consumers are still showing up if you have innovative products supported by a strong story telling capability and that\u2019s why we were getting the kind of organic growth rate we\u2019re going to have this year. I mean growing 8% globally in this environment isn\u2019t easy and it\u2019s done because we have great brands. Steve just talked about the new products in The North Face. It\u2019s also true for Vans and it\u2019s true for Timberland. And our investment in marketing is really about story telling. ", "We\u2019re going to make sure that we tell the story of the North Face, in the example he gave, in a really compelling way and what we basically did with the $10 million is we bought more ad space to get the story out there. That dynamic is working for us. Everything has to be aligned. You have to have the right story to tell. You have to tell well, it has to be backed by products that are really compelling and when you see the North Face ad this fall on TV it will touch you I promise. ", "Matthew Boss - JPMorgan", "Great, good luck guys. ", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move on to Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Morning guys, and first of all just a big congrats to Bob on your news this month, Bob it\u2019s great news for you. ", "Bob Shearer", "", "Thank you Mike. ", "Eric Wiseman", "We\u2019re not done with him yet. ", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Let me zoom in on The North Face for a minute there, I want to make sure I understand the growth trajectory. Help me think about in Europe it particularly sounds like you had an unfavorable shift in the quarter and there may be some weather issues in that market but if we think longer-term about that brand in Europe, what should The North Face grow at in Europe over the longer-term?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Okay Karl Heinz here Michael. Europe it\u2019s widely reported, it\u2019s not having the strongest economy at this moment. That\u2019s widely reported in the news. So is the Outdoor industry. Now we\u2019re not immune of this environment but that shouldn\u2019t be alibi not to grow. We had good quarter so far and we confirmed our goal for this year which is up in single-digits. So the brand is growing, the brand is strong. What we know from market data we are gaining share. It\u2019s doing well with consumers. What Eric mentioned before the innovative products are helping us a lot. So it\u2019s not the easiest environment but we are here with a goal to grow and we are growing this year. ", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Okay and then I guess maybe this will be a question for Bob but it looks like the gross margin expectations for the fourth quarter is for the expansion to accelerate from where it was in the third quarter. Can you just talk us through maybe some of the finer points of the components of that gross margin mix, maybe some of the dynamics that changed in fourth quarter versus third quarter other than the usual mix towards higher direct-to-consumer?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah and actually Michael that\u2019s what it is. In the fourth quarter, as I said, we\u2019re expecting more than a 100 basis points of expansion and a 100 basis points comes from mix and clearly no question that the strong D2C mix in the fourth quarter and our growing D2C businesses including the stores as well as e-com is a primary factor in that. So it pretty much comes down to that. There\u2019s a little bit -- what gets us above the 100 points is a little bit of help from that concession accounting change we talked about in the past couple of quarters and then other than that from a cost and pricing standpoint everything pretty much balances out. ", "So the mix factor continues to be a big factor for us and it has over the past number of years and it will for years to come. ", "Michael Binetti - UBS", "Okay, thanks again. ", "Bob Shearer", "Sure. ", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll hear from Omar Saad with ISI Group. ", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Thanks good morning guys. My first question I want to dig in a little bit deeper on the DDC -- DTC business, now over 20% seems to be consistently growing much faster than the wholesale. Could you share with us maybe some of the detail around how you think about the algorithm there, how the accounts played out, square footage growth versus comps store growth? And then layering in the e-commerce piece and how you think about that going forward and especially given some of the volatility in some of your wholesale channels in the mid-Tier do you think more about accelerating the DTC strategy?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure, Omar. Just to step back from a big picture in June of 2013 when we laid out our plan we thought we will get our direct-to-consumer business to about 25% of our total. Since that time we have changed our accounting for concessions. That\u2019s going to add a couple of points to that and we are now pointing probably at a 30% of VF total mix by 2017 or 2018. That\u2019s where it\u2019s going to come in. So yes, it is going to be growing faster than our wholesale business. A big driver of that is e-com. It\u2019s also the biggest unknown. It\u2019s really difficult for us to project what the e-com opportunity is five years out because we don\u2019t know how much consumers are going to have appetite for that and how they will be getting to our brands through their mobile or home devices.", "We are on track to add 150 new stores this year. We ended the third quarter with 131 more stores than we had at end of the third quarter last year. And that rate of about adding about 150 stores a year is what we have assumed will happen over the 2017 planning period. So combination of we expect to grow mid-single-digit comps in our brick and mortar stores. When you do that on top of adding stores that\u2019s probably going to -- and the E-commerce growth being really strong it\u2019s going to become a bigger part of mix and that\u2019s why we are taking about a 30% number now. Beyond that we don\u2019t have any guidance. Did that help you?", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "", "Yeah, that\u2019s very helpful. And one follow-up there has been a lot of volatility in the stock markets recently, health scares around Ebola and geo-political events in the Middle East and elsewhere. These big swings in the market do you see any -- are you seeing any impact at the consumer level, are consumers aware is it effecting their behavior at all, kind of week-to-week, month-to-month, day-to-day. I am just wondering if you are seeing that maybe in Europe more so in the U.S.", "Eric Wiseman", "We have not seen any material impact. I mean there is a lot things move consumers. Gas price is going down, right now that helps us a lot of in the mid-tier and mass channels because a lot of those customers have very little discretionary income and the fact some of it\u2019s not spoken at the gas pump might mean it could be spoken for buying a pair of Wrangler jeans, we\u2019d like that a lot. So all-in it\u2019s hard for me to sort through what effecting consumers but we are seeing enough consumer activity right now that we are confident in the kind of numbers we are laying out for the fourth quarter, which are pretty strong.", "Omar Saad - ISI Group", "Great, thanks guys. Nice job.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks Omar.", "Operator", "And we will move on to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America", "", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hey, Robby.", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America", "", "Just two questions I think mostly for Karl Heinz. First, Karl can you give us a little more detail on the improving inventory situations in China. Maybe remind us where the industry has been, I think that was maybe regarding North Face but maybe remind where the industry\u2019s been and where it is now what you think could be happening for North Face and any other brands in China you want to comment on. ", "And then the second question is just Europe Jeanswear, how is the environment different then the Jeanswear environment in North America? How are you driving the business over there? And also could you just remind us overall Russia\u2019s percent in your business and what\u2019s Russia\u2019s outlook looks like for you guys right now? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "", "Thank you. Okay, let me start with the first one, the China situation on inventories. You might recall we had an issue with jeans a while ago which stopped our growth. Now that is sorted out. In fact we have been growing since four quarters now in a row. So that is sorted out. On The North Face as we said in our last calls we saw it coming and we anticipated that. We did not deliver all the orders to the market and we start to see the benefit. The situation has improved. It\u2019s not where we want to be but it is improving, that\u2019s good news. ", "On Europe, I think you had two questions, the first one the jeans business being\u2026", "Robby Ohmes - Bank of America", "Yes, Jeanswear and\u2026", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "It is different market. I would say price points are a little bit higher. Consumers are willing to spend more for each jean. So our opening price points are starting from \u20ac50, \u20ac60 which is about $80-$90 so it\u2019s is a market which is not really growing in the last couple of seasons. We are doing well. We had some issues in the past but as you have heard us saying in the last few quarters we\u2019ve found a way which makes us grow in a low single-digit but we are growing, which is good news both on Lee and Wrangler. ", "Russia is a situation where we have a variable business model. Russia is tough at the moment you can imagine. We have a few owned stores but mostly actually are stores with partners. So we are not directly exposed. So our exposure in Russia is not big. It\u2019s a good market going forward but currently it\u2019s very, very small for us.

", "Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley", "Hi good morning. ", "Eric Wiseman", "Good morning. ", "Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley", "Just have a question about the guidance, so you mentioned that FX having a negative $0.02 impact on the full year number. Can you talk about how that impacts the P&L from the top line or the gross margin or SG&A and where we\u2019re seeing a change based on FX?", "Bob Shearer", "Yeah so from the top line standpoint also has some impact. So that on a full year basis, we\u2019re guiding to 8% and that would be 9% in constant dollars. So the $0.02 again it\u2019s versus what we previously assumed and primarily related to the Euro rate. So in our prior guidance we assumed a 1.33 rate for the remainder of the year and now we\u2019ve lowered that to 1.26. So it impacts in translation only, it impacts every line of the P&L going down to the EPS line. So it\u2019s pretty -- again it has that same kind of impact in each line. So the $0.02 on a full year basis related to again to the Euro move primarily.

", "Eric Wiseman", "Good morning Kate. ", "Kate McShane - Citi", "I have two questions, one is on Timberland with the stronger growth rate for wholesale versus D2C, it\u2019s a big difference from the trajectory we are seeing from the other brands. I just wondered if you expect that to change overtime and then why there is such a difference.", "Steve Rendle ", "Hey Kate, this is Steve. I\u2019ll take a shot at this and Cage can fill in for International side. As you saw last month, our strategy at Timberland is really, really working. We have been focused on really right sizing our D2C portfolio. As we went into this year we did not envision any new stores here in the Americas market, rather focusing on productivity. So as you look at that and you think about the impact of no new stores our D2C is not seeing the same growth rate as you would see, maybe you\u2019re seeing in our wholesale business. ", "In fact, our D2C business has been delivering high single-digit comps throughout the year and we see that continuing through the balance of the year here in the Americas. ", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And Kate we have a very stimulus situation in Europe, we have [not] opened stores. The goal was the same as Steve outlined. It\u2019s a little bit different in Asia, we have opened a few stores but its inline what we have done years before. Asia had been consistently growing since the acquisition, no big change there. ", "Kate McShane - Citi", "Okay great thank you. And I -- we\u2019ve called out on the call with regards to Nautica and just continuing challenges in Sportswear, can you talk a little bit about how much is just the category within the department store and how much is specific maybe to Nautica and maybe how you\u2019re going to try and address these challenges going on in the future?", "Eric Wiseman", "Absolutely so Nautica is really two stories, there is the wholesale channel which is very well reported, is not robust and we\u2019re doing well but we\u2019re not seeing growth in that channel. Where we\u2019re seeing growth and in that one place where we do control our brand is in our own D2C and we\u2019ve seen high single digit growth in our D2C with mid-single digit comps and I think that\u2019s a real testament to the brand and how we\u2019re able to bring that to life in our retail environment, how we\u2019re able to really show the new products that come out within the season and continue to give us confidence about the long-term potential of the Nautica brand.

", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks Kate.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll move on to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Good morning everyone. As you think about SG&A can you give any color around the fixed versus the variable components as how you\u2019re thinking about given the increased D2C component? And just as you think about next year puts and takes, cost of goods sold and FX, I know you\u2019d mentioned FX earlier, is there any other clarity? Thank you. ", "Bob Shearer", "Okay so I\u2019ll start on the SG&A, how we think about that. It\u2019s always hard to differentiate the fixed versus the variable. Frankly everyone here will tell you that I think about all of it as variable. There is always ways to control the SG&A but here I spoke to a bit in my commentary and it\u2019s the way our model works. Clearly you mentioned D2C, the D2C business I think everyone knows that the D2C businesses carry up a much a higher ratio of expenses to revenues and then our wholesale business. So it does all by itself it pushes up our ratio or would push up our ratio but what we have been able to do and as we spend more against marketing as well what we have been able to do is however is we look for offsets to that elsewhere in our expense structure.", "So and the ability to grow gives us the ability to leverage the rest of our expense structure against that growth. So yes the D2C business and the marketing side as well would push the ratio up by themselves but what -- because of the growth and it\u2019s something we look for elsewhere is to leverage the growth and offset those increases with reduction so that we are looking to keep our SG&A ratio relatively flat and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing, we\u2019re seeing in 2014. Again this concession accounting change will push up our SG&A ratio a little bit but outside of that, from an operational standpoint our ratio is about flat year-over-year. ", "And that\u2019s our model. We think it\u2019s a great model. So as we improve and grow our gross margins and keep our SG&As flat our overall operating margins expands. On the FX side your question was relative to next year in terms of what we are seeing, is that\u2026?", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Yes.", "Bob Shearer", "Yes obviously it\u2019s a little bit too early to talk about FX relative to next year, but we can say this, that our average rate for the year despite what we are seeing here at the end of the year especially relative to the euro, our average rate for the euro is still going to be about 1.33. If the euro stays where it is today that would put some pressure right on our overall earnings if it stays around the 1.26 to 1.28 range it would put some pressure on earnings but again it\u2019s just too early to call. We\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that in our February call when we layout 2015.", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes Dan just to add to that and we will do that in 2015 as Bob said -- if you had to make a call today you\u2019d probably see some headwind from currency, you might see some tailwind from Denim prices if cotton stays down, you might see a headwind from labor rates in Asia and we are going to detail all that out in February and get you to all the assumptions that we have built into our plan.", "Bob Shearer", "And then just one other point just so it\u2019s really clear is we hedge the transactional side not translation. So on a transactional basis we\u2019re pretty well hedged for next year. So we\u2019re not concerned about exposure from that standpoint. It would just be translating those foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.", "Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Bob Shearer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll hear from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolas & Co.", "Thanks, good morning, everyone. Couple of questions, first I think most of us very closing the directional [change in growth] rates from one quarter to next. Those rates for Vans and North Face in the third quarter appear notable at first glance. I\u2019m going to ask if you can explain in more detail the mechanics and magnitude of the shift in shipments for those brands into the fourth quarter.", "Eric Wiseman", "So just to make sure that we all heard your question, it was a little muffled, you are looking for an explanation of the quarterly timing shift for Vans and the North Face in terms of the revenue growth rates?", "Jim Duffy - Stifel", "That\u2019s correct, thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "Okay. So Jim here in the Americas it\u2019s absolutely a timing issue we had high-teen growth for Vans in the second quarter, we\u2019re seeing the same level of growth in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s a similar story for the North Face. I wish we could get our wholesale partners to understand that we need to speak to you on a quarterly basis and to have them smooth that out for us but if you look on a first half, second half you would see that we\u2019re coming right inline with our 12% guidance for North Face and the mid-teen growth for Vans.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel", "Okay, fair enough. Next question is on the mid-tier channel in the U.S., can you provide some updated perspective on your views and your strategies to manage risk around the mid-tier channel exposure into 2015?", "Steve Rendle ", "Yes Jim I can talk to you a little bit about that from a total channel we feel fairly good about the channel, feel fairly good about the customers right now. I think the most important thing for us going forward though is what we feel really good about is the partnership that we provide. We are helping to drive traffic, drive consumers into the stores, demand creation that we have, the new products and the innovation that we bring to the channel, we are an extremely important partner in this channel. So by upping our game and making sure that we are on top of it and bringing excitement to the channel, excitement to the categories that we participate in. It really helps the overall channel going forward. ", "Eric Wiseman", "Jim the only thing I would add to that is in terms of managing risk I would tell you that our inventories in the mid-tier channel are really clean, as clean as I've ever seen them and that's the one thing we can do to manage risk is to really keep our finger on the pulse of inventory, rates in these stores because the last thing any of us need is to get out of control there and we are not, our inventories are great.

", "Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. I have one for Karl Heinz I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more perspective by region and by specific country within Europe and Asia on what you're seeing from the consumer?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger ", "I guess the answer is similar to what Eric said before, starting with Europe. Europe it\u2019s widely reported is not having the best moment from an economic point of view. This is going on since a few quarters. I guess the answer there is what we are trying as far as we are doing innovative products, good retail concepts especially products and good storytelling that is helping us to navigate probably better than others to this environment. ", "China is little bit different. China has been growing a lot in the past years. The economic data are slower, a little bit more modest but still growing nicely, four five times faster than the rest of the world. We always had, we still have opportunities there in terms of penetration. Our total numbers of store is about 2000 as we said on four or five brands which is relatively low compared to big players. ", "We had an inventory issue in the past which we widely reported in jeans which is sorted out and outdoor is improving. So I guess the answer is the same for, similar I would say for Europe and China and Asia, innovative products good storytelling and continuous and a lot of marketing activities that is helping consumers coming into our brands. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Maybe just a little bit deeper in what you're seeing in Japan, what you're seeing in Southern Europe what you're seeing in Northern Europe, whether there is any kind of divergence. ", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Okay. Southern Europe actually is what the economists say is the worst but we sell good numbers on our bookings. They came in stronger than the past so it seems, it's going in the right direction. Japan we suffered the devaluation of the yen. We have reacted, we have increased prices. Japan has always been, it's a big market, it's a stable market, it's not a market which is growing a lot. So we're doing pretty well there with Timberland. We do well with Vans but all in all it\u2019s a market where we don\u2019t expect significant growth rates. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Okay. And then just one clarification on Timberland, it sounds like based on your full year guidance you're looking for 4Q to be a little bit slower than 3Q as I know it's against the tougher comparison but at the same time it sounds like you're looking for a meaningful acceleration in Timberland in Asia in the fourth quarter. So can you guys just help me breakdown the components of the 4Q guidance for that brand?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland in Asia had always been growing since after we bought the brand. We always did pretty well. We had consistent double digit growth in the market. So did we have it in the Q1 and Q2? Q3 is little bit slower and we expect Q4 to go back to the double digit path. There is no meaningful change on the performance of that brand in that market. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Is Timberland slowing in the U.S. and Europe in 4Q?", "Steve Rendle ", "Not at all here in the Americas. Very, very consistent growth across the quarters.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks, Lindsay. ", "Operator", "And next we'll move on to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions from me this morning. Bob first for you, could you speak a little bit more on the cost side as we think about potential benefit for lower cotton cost as it relates to in particular to the Jeanswear business? And then Eric secondly for you maybe just touching on the acquisition front just given the strength of the U.S. dollar right now, does that change how your prioritizing maybe some of the acquisition potential on a global scale. Thanks. ", "Bob Shearer", "So Erinn I'll start on the cotton. Sure we like what we see right now with the cost being lower. As you know we buy denim, not cotton and we buy that well in advance. So we're all locked in for 2014, so even the lower cost won't impact 2014. Assuming it stays where it is, assuming cotton stays where it is it would help us in 2015 but not until later into the second quarter.", "Steve Rendle ", "I\u2019d urge you to keep it in mind so that\u2019s you know on the plus side, I\u2019d urge you to keep in mind that there are a lot of other cost that enter into our product cost such as hides which have been up a bit, also synthetics and that kind of things. So there is a lot to sort through for 2015 and you know once again we\u2019ll have a lot more to say about that as we lay out our plans for 2015 in February. ", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, Erinn on the global acquisition front I am not sure exactly how to word this. No, it does not change how we think about our acquisition opportunities. We are always looking globally for strategic acquisition opportunities. So what\u2019s not lost on us the fact that a strengthening dollar would help us with that but in terms of the kind of the companies we are looking to buy and who will be right as part of our portfolio it doesn\u2019t change that thinking at all.", "Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then if I can just sneak one more question just on the premium denim space, it\u2019s clearly been a challenge for a number of brands really across the space for several quarters. If that space within wholesale is shrinking who or which type of brands or categories that are really capturing that space within the wholesale channel at this point?", "Steve Rendle", "", "Sure, this is Steve. So Premium denim there is a sector wide issue going on as women have not moved away from denim but likely are using denim for fewer occasions then they have historically and they have moved towards more of that performance athletic wear. I will say this you know with our 7 For All Mankind business we continue to see really strong share. They were not getting great growth in our wholesale we are seeing really good results within our D2C channel where we are continuing to open stores and seeing comp growth as we really focus on that consumer experience when they are in our store and looking for UPTs and higher conversions rates through just enhanced service. ", "I will tell you that the consumer responds very nicely when you bring new products not different than any other part of our business and our 7 For All Mankind business has a very dynamic and fast supply chain and have been able to react to trends both with materials, washes and silhouettes this year helping enhance our growth at D2C.", "Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray", " ", "Great, thank you guys and best of luck.", "Eric Wiseman", " ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And next we will move on to Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff \u2013 CLSA", "", "Hi, everyone. Can you talk about how much flexibility you have to fast-track replenishment in Outdoor & Action Sports in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, could you talk about the performance of Lucy and Dicks and other channels in 3Q?", "Eric Wiseman", " ", "Sure so, I will take the first one on our ability to react on an at once basis. Both of these businesses are very much pre-booked businesses. The orders we have in hand and the re-order calculations that we have in our model will be how we deliver the year. We do not have an ability to really react when it comes to these businesses. On Lucy, we are really excited about our Lucy brand and I am glad you asked about it. We saw a mid-teen growth rate in the quarter, our wholesale presence is a large part of that as we move to over 360 doors with Dick Sporting goods and in all door assortment with REI where we are seeing really good sell-throughs and really good brand presentation. ", "These are good partners for our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses and they have really been helpful in helping our Lucy brand grow beyond just being a D2C brand and being able to represent itself within the wholesale channel. We are seeing really great improvement in our product. We have new leadership at our Lucy brands and they have been in place for little bit over a year and the product is coming into the market on both on the performance side as well as more of some of the versatile do everything collection seeing really good sell throughs and giving us great confidence with the brand building momentum.", "Barbara Wyckoff \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", " ", "Yes, Barbara.", "Operator", "", "And our final question today will come from John Kernan with Cowen & Co.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co.", "", "Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in.", "Eric Wiseman", "Hey, John.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co.", "", "Just a follow-up on The North Face it slowed in Asia-Pacific you did lay out some of the reasons for that but is there anything going on with wholesale partners or the competitive environment there and what gives you confidence, the revenue acceleration you spoke out for the fourth quarter for North Face?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, let me start with that, John. A couple of things give us confidence the market is very fragmented in China and the North Face has absolutely a leading brand position first. Second one, we still have a pretty limited penetration in that market as you know. The market is divided by Tiers from Tier-1 to Tier-6 cities. We predominantly work in the upper part so there is still some path to go.", "As you know a lot of our business is done through partners and there are some challenges going on. We are helping the partners to become better retailer, the market have been growing fast in the past. It is a little bit changing and we are also working with them to make sure that the stuffs sells through it\u2019s better storytelling, it\u2019s better merchandising planning, really help those guys and so that we make sure that the merchandize ultimately sells out well. Steve?", "Steve Rendle", "", "And here in the Americas as I mentioned earlier we have great confidence for a couple of reasons. This is some of our strongest products that we have seen in this brand for many, many years, really clear seasonal initiatives, spring with the Mountain Athletics then the Ultra footwear and as we come into fall big stories around innovative platforms like ThermoBall and FuseForm supported by some of our best demand creation that you will start seeing coming online here in the next weeks. ", "Eric referenced the TV campaign that will launch here in the next week or two, will absolutely move you this is really strong, really playing on the heart and soul of this brand\u2019s focus of exploration and really challenging human potential. And with this strong demand creation the strong in-store merchandizing that you see across our wholesale channel as well as our own D2C give us great confidence in the Q4 will continue to accelerate and deliver against that 12% guidance that we gave for the year.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co.", "", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I can sneak one final one just on the acquisition environment helpful commentary there, but as a portfolio company would you ever be a seller in the market out there of a piece of the portfolio?", "Eric Wiseman", " ", "Yeah, we not only would, we have been, pretty regularly over the last decade I think we\u2019ve sold eight or nine businesses. So it is something that we look at that quality and health of our portfolio of businesses and its ability to accomplish our long-term objectives and we know we need to make some acquisitions along the way and will likely make -- to divest of some businesses along the way that is our model.", "John Kernan - Cowen & Co.", "", "Okay, thanks. Good luck.", "Eric Wiseman", "", "Hey, thanks. Thanks everybody for being on the call. I\u2019ll remind everybody that is just over eight weeks and a few days left to Christmas so please everyone go out and shop, buy a lot of products and please tick for price.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Lance Allega ", "Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us on our call today to discuss VF first quarter 2015 results.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everybody that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. I would also like to everyone know that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be in currency neutral terms. By our definition which is detailed in our press release issued 7 AM Eastern this morning, currency neutral amount exclude both the impact exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. We've chosen these currency neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions, because we feel more accurately represents the true operational performance in underlying results of our business and brands.", "Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included within the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.", "Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Scott Roe, our CFO; and VF Executives, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thank you and now, I'll turn the call to Eric.", "Eric Wiseman ", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. You once hear us speak about consistency in VF's financial performance and the strength of our business model about our powerful brands and our powerful platforms, which worked together to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. Along with consistency we also underscore the confidence we have and our ability to execute against our long-term goals while delivering near-term result.", "I am happy to report that our fundamental business is incredibly strong and the momentum we've established continues to build. In fact our performance in the first quarter of 2015 clearly demonstrates how we're expanding on that momentum. Currency neutral revenue, gross margin and earnings showed strong gains during the quarter making it a terrific start to the year. Taking a look at our operational highlights which are currency neutral, revenue was up 8% with growth in nine of our 10 largest brands, four of our five coalitions direct-to-consumer and wholesale and in every region around the world. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 10%, we also saw solid growth from our Jeanswear coalition with a 6% increase and our Imagewear coalition which grew by 8%.", "And congratulations to the [Eastpac] team, which was VF's fastest growing brand in the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 11% and included mid-single-digit comps. Our international business grew 9%, with Europe up 4%, Asia up 17% and a 16% increase from our Americas non-U.S. region. Gross margin which I'll discuss on a reported basis was 49% in line with our expectations and not surprisingly held back by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar actually by about 50 basis points in the quarter. All of which led to 13% earnings per share growth for the first quarter, indeed a very strong start to our year.", "Since the last time we spoke, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against global currencies, in fact the euro to dollar relationship which is VF's most significant foreign currency exposure was as high as [121] and as low [105] that volatility along with all new assumptions has produced a negative $0.06 impact to our earnings for the full year. Yet even with these additional headwinds I am proud to report that on a GAAP basis there is no change to our expectations for 3% revenue growth or 49.2% gross margin rate and 4% EPS growth to $3.20 per share in 2015. ", "Now take out the impact of currency and our expectations for 8% revenue growth and a 49.5% gross margin rate also remained unchanged. However due to underlying brand and operational strength and greater visibility to how the full year should play out we're now raising our full year currency neutral earnings growth expectation to 14% up from the 12% outlook we gave in February. This growth rate would of course be ahead of our 2017 plan for the second year in a row and clearly a bullish statement about our outlook for VF. ", "In summary while macro-economic, geopolitical and currency challenges continues to make headlines the things we can't control we had great confidence that we are in command of the things we can control our brands, our platforms and our operational disciplines all of which empower us to deliver consistent sustainable and profitable growth to our shareholders. 2015 is off to a great start. We've got our heads down and are executing well against our plans. We are confident. ", "So with that I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott take us through our five largest brands and then Scott Roe certainly not new to VF but new to this world will go to our financial results. So Steve it's over to you.", "Steve Rendle ", "Thanks Eric. Revenues for the North Face in the first quarter were up 7% which was in line with our expectations and included growth in all regions and channels. Globally we saw particular strength in our D2C business with revenues up 20%. Exiting the fall winter season inventories in our stores as well as our whole sale partners are very clean with excellent sell through as the colder weather wrapped around the world. ", "Looking towards the coming fall winter season the brand's order book is in line with expectations and we feel very confident in our ability to deliver low double digit global growth for the full year. ", "Now back to the quarter in the America's revenues were up at mid-single digit rate with D2C up more than 10% including strong growth in our e-commerce business driven by solid increases in both traffic and conversion. And speaking of e-com we're getting ready to re-launch new websites for both the North Face and JanSport this month bringing them on to same newly upgraded platform as Vans and Timberland a great example of our one VF approach as we leverage core competencies within centers of excellence across our portfolio.", "During the quarter, ThermoBall continued to build even greater momentum with triple digit growth at both wholesale and D2C. We also launched the North Faces FuseForm technology a bit more broadly with the Dot Matrix jacket and Ultra-Light Rain Shell that utilizes our revolutionary reading process to form multiple fiber types into a single fabrication to maximize functionality and performance. The launch was supported by a meaningful increase in demand creation to inform and amplify connections with consumers. ", "And the performance of the product and feedback from consumers thus far has been solid. We are encouraged as we look to continue to build momentum this fall with an even broader exposure in the re-launch of our summer series collection. We're also increasing demand creation investments for the North Faces Mountain Athletic training collection including our first ever spring TV commercial. Launched only a year ago the line continues to gain momentum and is helping further shift the consideration set of existing in new consumers towards the North Face as four season brand. This year's collection also includes women's products for the first time. ", "Now to Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thanks Steve, and good morning. The North Face international business was up at a low double digit rate driven by more than 30% growth in D2C revenues. In Europe revenues were up at high single digit rate driven by significant strength in our D2C business and comps greater than 25%. During the quarter we celebrated 30 years with our anniversary Mountain Jacket to great success and so continued momentum from our ThermoBall, FuseForm and running footwear products. ", "In Asia revenues were up at low double digit rate with both wholesale and D2C showing solid growth. A few highlights included launching our first ever Chinese New Year collection and collaboration with Tmall to promote our TNF 100 event on ultra-marathon trade running race. Based on feedback from both of these efforts we have great confidence about how we are positioning the brand and it is very important goal for market. ", "Overall we continue to feel really good about the North Face international business and our global outlook for the full year. Now let's turn to Vans.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "The Vans strong momentum continued with global revenues up 16% and bounced strength in both D2C and wholesale. This marks the brand 22nd consecutive quarter of double digit growth that's five and half years another amazing result in this team. ", "In the Americas revenues were up at a high teen rate with mid teen growth in D2C and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. We saw very strong growth in both footwear and apparel and are very excited to see significant momentum in one of our newest categories and lines the mountain addition collection. Designed for the elements mountain addition products still look just like iconic Vans product but feature weather proofing heat retention and traction technology as well. This is a critical growth strategy for Vans as we seek to become more meaningful in all four seasons especially when cold and wet weather sets in and people tend to think less about canvas. And after selling out of the entire line in its first season, demand for this coming fall winter is very strong. ", "We also continue to find interactive innovative ways to bring the Vans brand to life, are seeing the creative expressions on an art, music, action sports and street culture a great example of this is the continued expansion of our House of Vans concept using prop ups at exciting events like the South by South West Music Festival in Austin and the SIA Tradeshow in Denver. ", "And finally to sneak this in a bit of ahead of time, next year is a big year for the Vans brand given their 50th anniversary so we're already gearing up to celebrate in a way that only Vans can do, definitely stay tuned for this one.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Vans international business was up at mid-teen rate, driven by balanced wholesale and DTC results. In Europe revenue grew at the mid-single digit rate, driven by more than 20% growth in DTC and solid results in our wholesale business.", "Key footwear product highlights included a great performance from our enhanced comfort ISO collection as well as strong response to our printed styles. We also have strong growth in our apparel and accessory lines driven by DTC and wholesale. Both men and women's products are showing strong momentum with double digit pace. We also continue to engage consumers through unique events such as Vans Snow Day, [indiscernible] and High Standard all fantastic ways we're bringing the Vans to even more European consumers.", "In Asia, Vans continue to outperform with revenue increasing more than 45% and equally strong DTC and wholesale growth. Momentum continues in this region due to smart localized products especially in apparel, relevant brand right demand creation investments, events that speaks to the authenticity of our brand and a really sharp presentation at retail. The business is firing on all cylinders, in an ecosystem that has the consumer at the centre of everything it does. So overall really great momentum at Vans and globally we've continued to see a mid-teen increase in revenues for the full year and now on to Timberland.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Timberland revenues were up 10% driven by a mid-teen increase in global wholesale sales. The Americas recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth with revenues up at a high teen rate driven by nearly 30% wholesale growth and this resulted balanced with gains across the portfolio including both men's and women's and footwear and apparel. ", "In footwear it's been particularly exciting to see continued momentum in our women's collection as new products hit the mark in terms of style, relevance and trend. In our industrial Pro line the Pro Boondock and Powertrain collections had especially strong results as work consumers continue to respond favourably to these new innovative platforms.", "On the demands creation side, Timberland continues to drive brand heat and relevance through its Mark Makers program, for seasons now the brand has been outfitting influential trend setters from head to toe and creating compelling content to engage consumers across multiple media platforms. ", "And finally as I mentioned earlier we just launched Timberland's new website on April 14, marrying great content with new functionality to create a holistic brand and product experience for Timberland outdoor lifestyle consumer. And so far we're very encouraged by the early results, especially related to traffic and conversion. So, continued success, balanced growth and amazing product, all reasons we continue to be very bullish on Timberland.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland's international revenues were up at the low single digit rate. In Europe revenues were also up at low single digit rate. The men's business since reflects an Sensorflex and Cupsole product continue to build on the strong momentum from last year and casuals began to gain traction on the women's side. And our new website has seen very positive early results, a great indicator that our one VF approach has meaningful global benefit.", "Turning to Asia. Revenues increased at high single digit rate with strong wholesale growth. A couple of highlights included our new catalogue out sole boots and the [indiscernible] boots in particular that had great marketing support. Additionally apparel had a strong quarter driven by outerwear and tops. For the full year global Timberland is right on track to grow revenues at the low teen percentage rate.", "Now let's turn to Scott and Jeanswear.", "Scott Baxter", "Thanks K.H. Our global Jeanswear business was up 6% with positive results in all three regions wholesale and D2C in both the Wrangler and Lee brands. In the Americas region Jeanswear revenues were up at a middle single digit rate despite ongoing challenges and softness in the overall denim market. Revenues for Wrangler in the Americas were up at a low double digit rate. In the mass channel we saw continued momentum driven by new products, improved brand presentation and category expansion which created higher demand and conversion in our core pants business. Additionally, the expansion of our lifestyle products including broader offerings in both men's and women's tops gives us confidence that we're on track for meaningful growth in this important channel in 2015.", "In our Western business customers are responding well to our new product introductions including the advanced comfort line which will see greater mid-tier expansion in the second quarter. We've also seen positive reaction to our expanded Western performance platform with the launch of our Cool Vantage line a jeans for hot weather that maximizes breathability for work or play. And on the workwear side our new Wrangler Riggs campaign that features [indiscernible] has been a big win with both retailers and in consumer tests, giving us confidence as we roll this out nationally.", "Turning to Lee. The Americas business was down slightly yet we are encouraged by strong seasonal sales and continued momentum of our modern series products for both male and female consumers with continued traction in our department store business and enhanced demand creation support especially for the crucial fall season. We expect this brand to show slight growth over last year. KH?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Our international gents wear business was up at the mid-single digit rate driven by a mid-single digit increase in Europe and a high single-digit increase in Asia. In Europe the Keeps You Cool product continues to drive outstanding performance for the Wrangler business and we've also seen initial strong response to [born and ready] platform. In Lee we saw brand momentum continue which led to our eighth consecutive quarter of revenue increases in the region. We are also excited to report that our women's business has returned to double-digit growth driven by a number of new product initiatives. ", "In Asia our Wrangler business continued to focus on the denim performance range launching new finishers including water repellent and dust [indiscernible]. At Lee we continue to see strong reception for our key product collection stores and introduced new assortments in a number of lines during the quarter. ", "In summary, we're off to a great start to 2015 in our global Jeanswear business and expect momentum to continue throughout the year to reach our target of low single-digit revenue growth. And now back to Scott on Imagewear. ", "Scott Baxter", "Thanks KH. Our Imagewear coalition posted strong revenue growth of 8% in the first quarter driven by mid-teen growth in our workwear business particularly the Red Kap brand with a very strong start to the year we're on track for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2015. ", "And now over to Scott Roe for our financials. ", "Scott Roe", "Thanks Scott. Well that sure is a lot for a CFO to like in this quarter. Our diverse portfolio of brands continues to thrive based on innovative products, connecting with consumers where, when and how they shop and the amazing opportunity that we have to expand our business around the world its look more robust. In our first quarter revenues on a currency neutral basis were up 8% and as Eric mentioned we saw growth in nine of our 10 largest brands four of our five coalitions and in every region around the world. By channel our direct-to-consumer business grew by 11% and we saw a high single-digit increase in sales to our wholesale customers. ", "The Outdoor and Action Sports coalition continue to lead the way and the Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses maintained the momentum we saw at the end of 2014. Growth in all regions, all channels and across multiple coalitions underscores the power of VF's portfolio. ", "As expected our gross margin rate was down 40 basis points to 49% in the quarter due to the negative impact of foreign currency however to give a bit more context around this on the plus side and in line with our expectations our typical mix benefit of about 60 basis points from our highest margin businesses was closer to 40 basis points as strong growth in Jeanswear and Imagewear which carry relatively lower margins tampered our normal mix benefit, more than offsetting this mix benefit was about 30 basis points of higher cost due in part to timing factors we discussed during our last call and about 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds driven by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In fact with an average euro rate of 112 versus 137 in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 respectively it was one of the largest movements we've seen since the financial crisis of 2008. ", "Despite the strengthening of the Swiss franc which added nearly 20 basis points of expense in the quarter our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was about flat. This demonstrates the power of our business model as we continue to invest in D2C and demand creation while leveraging other expenses. First quarter operating margin was 14% which includes a negative 70 basis points impact from currency headwind. Carrying that down currency neutral earnings per share increased 13% on a reported basis EPS was in line with last year's first quarter. ", "Now taking the look at our performance by coalition revenues for Outdoor and Action Sports were up 10% on a currency neutral basis and even stronger result when you consider this quarter was negatively impacted by the 53rd week which traded a very strong retail week in early January for a relatively weaker week in early April, yet was solid growth in both our wholesale and D2C businesses including positive results from nearly every brand and double-digit growth in Vans in Timberland and a high single-digit increased for the North Face 2015 is right on track. ", "Reported operating income for the coalition declined 5% and operating margin came in 120 basis points lower than last year at 16.2% predominantly due to changes in foreign currency rates as nearly half of the Outdoor Action Sports business in the quarter was outside of the U.S. The decline was also related to the impact from the 53rd week and our increased D2C investments including a 116 additional retail stores compared with the same period last year. ", "As we've seen during the past few years the addition of stores earlier in the year pressures earnings in the first half while paying off in the second half as we entered the peak retail season. For the full year there is no change to our expectation that currency neutral revenues for the Outdoor and Action Sports coalition will grow at a low double-digit rate. ", "Turning to Jeanswear, revenues were up 6% currency neutral and included positive global results for both Wrangler and Lee. Reported operating income grew 2% and operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%. We are really pleased with Jeanswear's performance and remain confident in our ability to achieve low-single-digit growth for the full year. ", "Results in our Imagewear business were strong with 8% currency neutral revenue growth driven in part by our Red Kap business. Reported operating income for the coalition was up 9%, which resulted in a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. ", "As the year plays out, we expect revenue growth rates for Imagewear to be more consistent with our full year expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Our Sportswear business grew 3% reflecting similar increases in both wholesale and D2C channels and a high single-digit increase in revenues from Kipling. Operating income was up slightly and operating margin was in line with last year's results. For the balance of the year, we expect a similar growth rate to close out the first-half and the full year to remain on track with our expectation for a mid-single-digit increase in revenue. ", "Our Contemporary Brands business continue to experience challenging consumer demand for premium denim and women's contemporary apparel which resulted in a 7% currency neutral decline in revenues and a decline in profitability. We continue to expect about flat results on a year-over-year basis for this coalition. ", "Turning now to our balance sheet, our inventories were up 7%, right in line with expectations. During the first quarter, we bought back 10 million shares for a total of approximately $730 million. There are currently no plans to purchase additional shares in 2015. We also made a discretionary contribution of $250 million to our U.S. pension plan which is now fully funded, something we are proud to report. So let's turn our full year outlook, let's turn to our full year outlook now and we'll start with currency, since it play such a central role to this year's story. In February we laid out our assumption of a [\u20ac130] to U.S. dollar relationship with the direction that $0.05 move in the euro on a full year basis would need an impact on revenues of about $125 million and $0.05 per share on our EPS.", "Now with one quarter behind us and a revised euro to U.S. dollar assumption of [1.10] for the balance of the year, our $0.05 move in the euro would mean an impact on revenues of about $80 million or $0.04 per share in EPS. Keep in mind that other currencies have also continued to devalue against the U.S. dollar. However, the euro remains our most significant exposure and as a reminder, our first and third quarters are the largest for our international businesses and therefore a stronger dollar would have the most significant impact on our results during those periods. Using the [\u20ac1.10] to dollar assumption there is obviously some impact on our expected full year reported results. ", "So let's take a look now how that flows through the P&L. At the top-line there is no change to the outlook we gave in February. We continue to expect currency neutral revenues to be up 8% in 2015, which is in line with the growth rate we laid out in our 2017 plan.", "And we expect reported revenues to be up 3%, putting us at about $12.7 billion for the year. On our full year currency neutral gross margin assumption remains about unchanged at 49.5%, which would be equal to our 2017 target two years ahead of plan. Independent of foreign currency, the annual expansion in gross margin of about 60 basis points, primarily from the favorable mix shifts that we've seen for so many years remains intact and despite even greater strengthening into the U.S. dollar, we continue to expect that same 49.2% gross margin rate for the full year on a reported basis, all of which takes us to the bottom-line. ", "On a reported basis, despite an additional $0.06 negative impact from changes in foreign currency about half of which relate to the euro and the balance relates to other currencies, we expect 4% EPS growth to $3.20 compared with last year's adjusted EPS of $3.08. This means we are taking up our full year currency neutral EPS outlook to 14%, that's two more points of growth than our previous outlook, once again putting us ahead of our 2017 pace.", "So what gives us confidence in our ability to absorb $0.06 of currency impact, first the continued momentum that our brands are realizing around the world and the underlying strength that these brands provide sound footing for the year? Second, with four months behind us, fall order books in hand and more visibility into our second half, we are even more confident and how our story should play out over the year. Greater visibility, coupled with a solid first quarter has built confidence. Confidence in our business model that continues to deliver consistent results even in dynamic environment.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first quarter from Bob Drbul from Nomura.", "Bob Drbul ", "I guess I had two questions, the first one is on the inventories, when you look at sort of the revenue base in real dollars and then the inventory levels, can you just talk us through how you're balancing those numbers and like with inventories up seven and the revenues up two just sort of reconcile that for us a little bit?", "Scott Roe", "This is Scott, I'll take that. It's matching supply and demand in any case difficult and it was particularly difficult in the first quarter give the disruptions relative to the port strike. We in general manage through that very well we saw that coming, we did things like extend lead times in some cases broaden inventory early. And you really didn't hear us talk about the impact to our quarter for the port strike, that's because it was relatively significant. Sure we have some disruption but it was minimal and not big enough to talk about. So as it relates to the inventory we see we are very confident and the quality of the inventory it's matched with future orders and as a matter of fact our days are down slightly compare to a year ago. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And I just have a question on the jeans wear business. Scott can you elaborate a little bit on the Americas business I guess specifically the Wrangler and the mass business. What's going on there and those numbers are quite impressive. So if you could elaborate little bit that would be helpful for us.", "Scott Roe", "Over the last couple of years you've heard me talk a lot about our product and our product engine, our innovations our demand creation. And what you're seeing as a combination of a lot of hard work from the Wrangler team on new product innovations that have come to like. So you've got advance comfort, heavily touch, couple of just examples that have now gained broad distribution within the mass channel. And then with our demand creation platform the consumer has really taken those products both male and female. And then in addition to that if we're speaking just specifically in that channel in the mass channel, we've got a really strong selection this year from the seasonal standpoint. So our consumer has loved our assortment and the takeout has been fantastic, so more to come in the future. We feel really good about where the business is, feel really good about our innovation pipeline and the products that are in that and we'll continue with a more assortment, more product innovations and better distribution within the products that I just spoke of.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti ", "Scott just a little bit more color on direct-to-consumer perhaps. You guys plan that business to grow I think double digits this year versus only five in the quarter 5% in the quarter. You mentioned that store growth rate would accelerate a little bit. But there are some pretty big comparisons coming in the back half. Can you walk us through some of the big line items like footage cadence and comp sales to get back to the run rate that you pointed for the year. ", "Scott Roe", "Yes I guess first just in terms of some stats we're going open about a 125 stores this year on an annual basis. And from a comp standpoint we're more or less the same as we saw last year, a little better than acceleration and obviously that's in the back half of the year during the peak season.", "Scott Baxter", "And Michael one way you can think about that is we're going have a 125 net new stores open this year so that will help us. We also have a lot of top most stores going into the first half of this year. The way we've talked about comps is overall comps are in the mid to single, so low to bit single digits. But it varies by geography, obviously much stronger in the Asia Pacific region then in the United States and all that's really about our brick and motor stores. You have to remember that our e-com business is going to grow by over 30% has the last few years and we expect it to happen this year too. So that's a really strong horse pulling that wagon for us.", "Michael Binetti ", "And then just one quick follow up Scott hate to do this to you, but I'm going to ask you to ask you to one of Bob's comment some last quarter -- last quarter, Bob mentioned it, you guys have mentioned him a few times that you'll be at your 2017 guidance for the gross margin by the end of this year and made a lot of progress on that early. So as we look into next year Bob mentioned that obviously he doesn't want us flat lining on our longer term model starting in 2016 just flat lining the gross margin, so he said to us I believe to still expect the 50 to 70 basis points of gross margin expansion per year that you guys guided to in your Analyst Day. ", "We are all staring at the gross margin pressure and we've heard from other companies that the transactional pressure will have an impact in the first half of 2016. So are you guys are going to see the same dynamics on gross margin from FX as your hedges roll off into the first half of '16 and then how do we get to the expanded gross margin reported rate next year if that is the case. Thanks. ", "Scott Baxter", "You partially answered the question in the way you asked it, because we will see that 60 basis points plus or minus mix benefit going forward. We've seen that for the last several years, there is no reason we wouldn't expect that going forward now. We're not going to give guidance on 2016 it's not time for that. But in general of course if the euro were to stay where it is today and few can predict that you are better than anybody else. Sure that would have some pressure, on the other hand we've talked about input cost generally are lessening and of course we always have pricing levers that we can pull which we have in the past. So again I can't give you exact guidance on '16 but we would say the mix there is no reason that mix benefit won't continue to be there and there are many other levers besides currency which will be impact in our 2016 guidance.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane", "I appreciate the commentary on the outlook for 2015 and the raising of guidance on the bottom line. But I think one of the reasons why you are raising it because you have more confidence in what you're seeing for the later part of the year. But I don't think revenue guidance is going up. So can you reconcile that for us?", "Scott Baxter", "Yes, so you're right Kate we have maintained the 8% currency neutral and 3% as reported. But that confidence within that obviously we're feeling better about the year and that means that we see some slight improvement on the top line if you are trying to model that out. It's not enough to change the overall guidance but yes we're feeling more bullish and that really should translate into a little bit better top line.", "Kate McShane", "And then my second question is on contemporary, down quarter but guiding flat for the year. Could you walk us through the cadence of growth for the rest of the year and what's giving you confidence of accomplishing that in the contemporary category?", "Steve Rendle", "Kate this is Steve. So, contemporary as we mentioned continues to see pressure in the sectors that they do business in specifically women's premium -- men's and women's premium denim and women's contemporary. As last year we saw our D2C as a bright spot in our go to market in our ability to tell our stories to our consumers in a really clear and productive way. We're seeing strength in some of our wholesale partners, it's giving us confidence this year to couple with our D2C carrying forward into the balance of the year. And really good balanced growth between both 7 For All Mankind and Splendid Ella Moss is giving us confidence that we'll be in that flat range from a full year standpoint.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.", "Matthew Boss", "So you have three brands that are all more or less around the $2 billion level today. Can you guys talk about market share penetration today and broader growth in each category as we think about the longer term complexion of your portfolio?", "Steve Rendle", "I will take this one. I am going to try to pull some things out of my memory bank. North Face at about 2.3 billion and we've come out and stated really operates in a market that's about 26 billion in total in that outdoor performance category, that will put them in an 8% share. Vans is just over 2 billion pressing that mark last year action sports at 29 billion market has been then around that 7% range and Timberland approaching 2 billion at 1.8 in that outdoor lifestyle category we have somewhere around 36 billion so quick math would say that's mid-single digit market share.", "What we don't capture in that is the athletic, training, lifestyle and some of the youth culture numbers. And we were to layer that in against each one of those three segments each one of them would be about 70 billion in total which really translates into a lot of headroom for each one of these brands in their respective sectors.", "Matthew Boss", "So as you think over the next couple of years -- over the long term I mean is it -- seems like there is the ability that every single one of these brands could potentially double. Is that out of the realm a possibility?", "Steve Rendle", "It's absolutely not out of the realm of possibility. I think as we speak to you at our Investors Day, we really lay out those strategies that are deeply embedded in our knowledge of our consumer and how that informs product and demand creation in our go to market with our D2C. We are extremely confident in these three brands continuing to grow but also taking that knowledge that we've developed with these three brands and applying it to other brands within our portfolio and I think you see some of that going on right now with our Wrangler brand and you will see that really coming to life in other brands like Kipling and such.", "Matthew Boss", "And then quick follow up on the balance sheet, so $1 billion increase in short term borrowings. Is that more seasonality related? And then if you just kind of think forward, any line that you've drawn in the sand to think about potentially increasing the capital allocation just given the building cash balance if you were to remain patient on the acquisition front?", "Scott Baxter", "Matthew, this is Scott I'll take that one. First, you are correct. The CP balances are seasonal, that's really what that is. It's a seasonal timing issue. We will be out of CP by the end of the year and that's just the way that the ups and flows come through the year. And as it would be typical we're a little ahead of where we were last year but we'll be out of that by the end of the year. As it relates to capital allocation really no change in the way we've talked about that, acquisitions remain our first priority, followed by dividends and we said consistently and we demonstrated we won't accumulate cash. So in the event that one of the first two leverage are not available, then we would look at returning that to shareholders through repos which we have done over the last two years.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie. ", "Laurent Vasilescu ", "I have two sourcing related questions. First is on input cost. I think Scott mentioned that input costs were up a bit during the quarter. What are you seeing in terms of input costs going forward? Do you anticipate a benefit in 2H 2015 regarding cotton, and oil-based synthetics and if that's the case could you potentially quantify it?", "Scott Baxter", "Scott here and I will take that Laurent. What we're seeing is that we did indeed see a higher input cost in the first quarter and we see that through the first half, that's starts to mitigate in the second half slightly particularly more in leather than cotton although there is a little benefit there. On the other hand we did see that labor in overhead is an increasing cost. So really not significant in the second half. ", "Going into next year we should see some tempering petrochemicals, leather again which we've seen high cost come down. But again we're not -- that's directional and these things change along with currency. So right now I can't quantify that nor would we give any kind of guidance into 2016 at this point. ", "Laurent Vasilescu ", "And then my second question on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. U.S. is at the cusp of a free freight agreement with much of Asia which could potentially eliminate footwear and apparel tariffs. Curious if you are factoring in the TPP in terms of your long-term view on sourcing across geographies and if you could see any potential savings on tariffs what would you do with the savings? Would you reinvest it in marketing, R&D, reduced prices or flow it to the bottom-line?", "Scott Baxter", "I guess I will take that one. We have been watching this for a number of months even years this has been going on, and it does appear that maybe making some progress. It will have some benefit to us, we're still evaluating that. I mean the details aren't fully worked out, and we would have to look at it. Our priorities in terms of should there be some opportunities our priorities remain the same. We would be investing in those growth drivers which have been successful for us so far. Our lifestyle brand international and D2C would be our priorities from an investment standpoint. ", "Steve Rendle", "And we do that because that's in the best interest of our shareholder contract.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. ", "Omar Saad ", "Outdoor Action Sports it's been such a big segment of the business for so long, it seems like it slowed this quarter even I know the reported numbers non-indicative of the underlying growth, but still seem to decelerate a little bit price lower than it's been in a while. Are there timing issues going on there and you also sound really confident about the outlook for that business for the rest of the year in North Face for example the retail reported numbers look really good in the quarter. Help me understand some of the dynamics going on in this quarter if there is anything to call out. ", "Steve Rendle", "Omar this Steve, I will take that [indiscernible] might want to fill in from international standpoint. So we absolutely remain very confident in our Outdoor and Action Sports businesses. I think the effect that you see in Q1 that we didn't detail necessarily in our remarks was that impacted the 53rd week to specifically the North Face and Timberland two big drivers was equal to 3 percentage points of growth. So if we were to put that each one of those brands North Face would have been at 10 and Timberland would have moved in to the low-teens. ", "Kind of factoring that and understanding that we had that in our plans, we saw that coming, continues to give us confidence in the guidance that we gave last quarter. ", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Omar there is not too much to add on the international side, it's a similar picture. Starting with Asia you heard us we're doing really well in Asia, we expect nice growth in most of the Asian markets on the large brands. And similar picture in Europe, the guidance we gave for Europe is to grow high single-digits. So there were some issues by quarter but the full year outlook is really good. ", "Eric Wiseman", "And Omar its Eric I will finish that comment, Steve mentioned that the 53rd week switch that we had cost Timberland and the North Face 3 percentage points of growth which is true. For the global Outdoor and Action Sports coalition it cost us 2%. So what we reported -- what we talked about is 10 is our constant currency number would have been a 12. ", "Omar Saad ", "I think you called out Kipling and Napapijri a quarter or two ago as the potential next billion dollar brands. Any updates there?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Starting with Kipling, you heard us saying Kipling was the fastest growing brand in last year and two years ago, and based on the outlook we have this year it would be the fastest brand again for the third year in a row, so it's good. We had a good quarter we don't release that numbers but we had a good quarter in all three areas, I guess that's the good news in the U.S. in Europe, and in Asia and in several channels in wholesale and D2C. Napa is a similar picture, Napa is predominantly Europe we see a good year for Napa and up high single-digit. So the smaller brands are growing, especially Kipling is becoming a meaningful business for us. ", "Omar Saad ", "And maybe one last quick question for Eric and Scott. The acquisition environment kind of remains a little bit stuck and the willingness is [indiscernible] there. Can you talk about your willingness to pursue other strategies in terms of maybe not just capital and using debt and cash but is there potential to use issue equity to make a bigger acquisition, maybe help loosen the wheels a little bit?", "Scott Baxter", "We get that kind of discussion from last week when we talk with them, we're very, we continue to remain very disciplined about exploring our acquisition opportunities and creative about how we might bring one in. Of course the good news as a shareholder is we're real disciplined about what we'll pay to, it's not part of how you pay for and what you pay and we just haven't found the right combinations to unlock that opportunity and just know that we are diligent and something that we work on every single week and eventually, we will bring something in, but nothing to report today.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Creativity is on the table.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yes it is.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually [indiscernible] for Robby. Thanks for taking our questions. Scott can you give you an update on the trends in the mid-tier channel for Jeanswear in the U.S.? And then have you seen any change or improvement in the -- kind of low to middle income consumer in the Jeanswear business?", "Scott Roe", "We've seen very positive trends in the mid-tier channel, so we've seen enough fix in our business; we're really pleased with it. The consumer is coming back to that channel for sure, I think the consumer is really dialed into innovation in that channel. So we spend a lot of time on some innovative products, our Easy Fit, our Comfort Fit, our Modern Series. Those products are really taking with the consumer very well. So really feeling bullish about that and I think the single most important thing for us right now in the mid-tier channel is that we've introduced Wrangler to mid-tier channel very successfully. So we're rolling Wrangler out, still has a lot of opportunity, a lot more distribution in the mid-tier channel. And so we've got a really powerful two brands that we're bringing to the mid-tier channel in that bottoms category right now, that's pretty important for us. That answers your question?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. And then just in terms of the really strong growth Vans in Asia, how should we think about that growth longer-term? And then can you maybe talk about how many doors you have in China now and where that could go overtime?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "You heard us saying Vans had an amazing run in the last quarters in Asia and it has been a meaningful brand for us. Now we have declared that growth which was in the [aisles] of 50%, will that stay, probably hard going forward. But we are very, very confident on our long-term goals. The good news is the brand is doing well by geography, not only in China but in Asia, allover in Asia and the more developed countries Korea, Japan but also in developing markets like Malaysia or Indonesia. It's doing well by channel; we see good comps on who it's doing well and who sell. And it's doing well by category and Footwear and Apparel. So yes, we are very positive for the long-term outlook for Vans in Asia.", "Now the question on the doors, was that related to China?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Yes, I always say, we have now, I think we have around 2,500 doors altogether on primarily five brands, which if you benchmark that with the big, big brands which are playing in Asia they are all working around 5,000. So, I think the answer is implied we still have room to grow by adding doors overtime.", "Steve Rendle", "The new markets we started, we want our VF subsidiary in Korea two years ago and we built -- we want the Vans brand there with our starting point and Karl Heinz and I were actually there last month celebrating the success of that team it is off to a fantastic start and we think the brand has a lot of legs particularly in the Asia Pacific region.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.", "Barbara Wyckoff", "What percentage of Vans sales came from footwear versus apparel? And can you talk about the penetration of men's versus women's in Vans and the opportunities there, where is the growth is going to come from besides just more doors?", "Steve Rendle", "This is Steve, from an America standpoint the predominant percent of our growth with Q1 was footwear. So we are continuing to see expanded growth in our apparel, high-teen growth this last quarter. Right in line with what we see going on with our footwear. Men's and women's in footwear, it's kind of hard to tell because many of our styles are unisex, but we were to try to overlay, we're probably about 60:40 men's to women's if we were to try to capture the meaning of that unisex sizing. And where will the growth come in the future? We have a tremendous amount of opportunity here in the North America market. You've heard us talk about our expansion strategies we move geographically with our stores that help supercharge our wholesale distribution, the brand is moving into athletic. We opened up with sporting goods this quarter in a significant number of doors and new initiative that they have and we're continuing to work with our partners at foot locker to expand the growth there.", "So a lot of opportunity here in United States, Canada, our Mexico business is extremely strong and at the front end of its growth and we're just beginning to convert distributors in South America. It will give us a tremendous amount of upside in those developed markets there as well.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And seeing that picture for us on the international side you hear that I've saying before we have it by geography we just opened a subsidy in Korea where Vans is doing extremely well. It just started two years ago long, long way to go we still have the South Asian market which we just started. We also have distributors there which one they would probably can convert. So geography for sure the other one is category similar picture for us apparel is small but it is growing faster than footwear. So that's a big expansion and then the other one is our DTC like e-commerce doing well and stores. So very, very articulate rate going forward.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. ", "Lindsay Drucker Mann ", "I wanted to ask about Outdoor and Action margins in the quarter it wouldn't make sense -- margins came under pressure would make sense as you had if you re-trading 53rd week and you had less productive week. So maybe you would have delivered on some of the fixed cost. But you guys also mentioned some demand creation expense in the quarter. So I just wanted to get your view on how we should think about Outdoor and Action margins across the full year and maybe some perspective on what drove the compression in 1Q.", "Steve Rendle", "So as I mentioned in my comments Lindsay this was a particular big international quarter and also the delta on currency we had a 137 average year ago versus 112 in the first quarter. Combination of those two things put a lot of currency pressure on outdoor as margins in the first quarter it was 80 basis points and again you said it in your question also those sales that Steve mentioned under 53 week those are profitable sales. So really those are the two largest factor that impacted the quarter but now when we zoom out and look at the full year we see kind of the normalizing of the margins and we see expansion outdoor action sports margins will grow faster than revenue for the full year.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann ", "The demand creation expense is that sort -- was the call of because it was timing that was particularly one queue weighted or is there an incremental step up versus what you were expecting?", "Steve Rendle", "We continue to invest in demand creation it's roughly growing with sales. So wasn't a big factor in the quarter.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Just real quick Lindsay where we put those dollars here in the Amercias was first in Q1 around the FuseForm launch in really driving that story to support the placement and as well as I mentioned in my remarks we're putting significant effort behind mountain athletics as we look to expand the North Face into more of a 12 month out of the year brand and really help drive that shift in outdoor towards via outdoor athletics space that we've been talking about over the last couple of years.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann ", "And then Karl Heinz I wanted to ask about Europe on an organic basis we were a little surprised to see the sequential deceleration in the first quarter versus the run rate you had the last few quarter especially because it feels like the economy is getting better there. I was just -- if you could shed some light on if there was anything particular to happen in the quarter if you are looking for reacceleration across the back half of the year. Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "I guess you heard those saying we are full year outlook is intact. So the good news we have seen no changes in our potential for the full year. We have some issues sometimes in the quarter but no the answers were pretty confident we have seen no signals which would change our mind for the full year goals which we have given. And this is true for the large brand but also for the smaller brands which I commented before.", "Steve Rendle", "And just to add to that Steve mentioned the 53rd week impact could also be a factor in Europe as well which will hold down your growth rate little bit in the first quarter. We still high single digits for the year and there is no change in the overall.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "First quarter came in as we expected.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Group.", "Chris Svezia ", "I guess Steve for you just on Timberland for a sec. The growth in Americas is 30% whole sale growth. I was just wondering may be you can talk about you mentioned women's, you mentioned the pro-line. But a little color maybe on anything on distribution or pricing may be how we think about that momentum for the balance of the year. Just a little more color about that business please.", "Steve Rendle", "We've been very bullish for the last umpteen quarters about the growth of Timberland. And I think you can probably hear that in our comments today its broad based, we are seeing success across all of our collections certainly driven from the heritage of the boot but absolutely moving into casual silhouettes both spring and fall. We're seeing it across all channels our own B2C as well as wholesale and the across wholesale the various points that we come to sell in and we're seeing it in men's and women's as well as youth. ", "I think it's really safe to say that these brand are our leaders there have really embraced the information that they've taken out of our consumer research applied it to their product strategy, that's a global comment and we really have understood how to bring our brand to life to our consumer, delivering content to where they are. We see this continued growth, we're very bullish and we see great upside not just in our footwear but also in our Pro Workwear business and as well as apparel.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Any color Steve at all on how apparel's been doing for you, what some of the [learnings] just some of the data points [indiscernible]?", "Steve Rendle", "We are learning it's a really good word to use and I think we've been clear, we started slow and we are incrementally increasing doors with the partners that we've launched with. And each year or each season we continue to see good growth. We're seeing Riggs -- we sell through Riggs here in the U.S. market in the high single digit rate, that's good from a retail sale point and that's helping us gain confidence to expand our collection, expand our doors and really move towards that long term projection. Apparel is much larger on an international standpoint with our largest penetration in Europe but also significant growth and opportunity in Asia.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then Scott real quick to you just on the inventory growth, just maybe how we think about that throughout the balance of the year, is that's such a trend more in line with sales or reported sales in back half of the year just a little color there please.", "Scott Roe", "Sure. I mean we don't give quarterly outlooks but I would say for the year when you look at our cash flow and our balance sheet projections we see no issue with inventory, we're really confident that the quality is there, and we're not concerned about the inventory.", "Operator", "And we'll take a question now from Matt McClintock from Barclays.", "Matt McClintock", "Good morning everybody. I just wanted to ask a question on e-commerce. Could you just give us some color on how e-commerce businesses for your various brands are performing? I know you have a bunch of digital platform launches and re-launches over the last few years. So, how has that impacted those businesses and how should we think about the performance, the ecommerce performance of those businesses as you start to compare against those platform re-launches? Thank you.", "Eric Wiseman", "Let me make an opening comment on that and I'll hand it over to Steve and Karl Heinz. Some context Matt in 2007 now I know I just went way back in history but I have to know the numbers so I'll do that. Our global ecommerce business across all brands was $7 million. So we have been working hard since that time to try to put in place e-com platforms around the world that make sense. And we are -- when I look at that as part of our future growth I look at it as being one of the largest sources of our future growth because of how underdeveloped we are versus all the other levers we have to pull.", "And as you would expect while we're building these sites brand by brand and country by country, we're focused most on our biggest brands and we have a lot of brands to add and a lot of countries to add and a lot more to deal. And with that I'll turn it over to Steve and let you [wane] on this.", "Steve Rendle", "I mean ecommerce, to Eric's point, is really new. I mean it's one of the tools and it was North Face that has led the [indiscernible] to really understanding how to really bring to our brand to life digitally. Year-to-date our ecommerce business is about 18% of our D2C we talked a lot about our new platforms, Vans came live on last year and we saw a great acceleration to the second half of the year and that absolutely continues to be the case here this year. Timberland has just launched in April. North Face and JanSport are going live today. And following them will be our Wrangler and Lee businesses, our Lucy, Reef and SmartWool towards the back half of the year.", "So, we are really happy with our website it's an adaptive responsive Web site and I don't want to get too geeky here, but our brands have rich-rich content. And we've developed a content a platform that marries content with product, helps us tell very-very strong stories connected with our products with drive conversion and ultimately help drive sales. It's also a site that's very easy to adapt content mobile as we see our consumers shift to accessing our sites from their mobile devices.", "Lance Allega ", "Thank you. And operator that will conclude our remarks today I think Eric might have a couple words and we'll close the call.", "Operator", "Yes sir.", "Eric Wiseman", "I'll just thank all of you for spending your morning with us, talking about the current status and future of our company. As I said in my comments, we are confident about where we are this year. And I think I also mentioned that we are heads down ensuring that we deliver the results that we've promised for this year. And the last comment I'll make is a special shot after Bob [indiscernible] we know you're listening.", "Steve Rendle", "Bob give me a call let me know what's like on the other side of this line. Thanks everybody. See you in 90 days. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Lance Allega", "Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF\u2019s second quarter 2015 results.", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that participants on this call will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. I would also like to remind everybody that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today\u2019s call will be in currency neutral terms. By our definition which is detailed in our press release issued at 7 am Eastern Time this morning, currency neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. We\u2019ve chosen to use currency neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions, because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.", "Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.", "Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Eric Wiseman, VF Chairman and CEO; Steve Rendle, President and COO; Scott Roe, our CFO; and VF executives, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "Our second quarter results add another proof point to VF\u2019s long and proven track record of delivering consistent profitable growth to our shareholders. Our ability to serve consumers and retail partners and to continuously expand on the momentum we created has never been greater.", "In the second quarter, currency neutral revenue was up 10% an acceleration from our first quarter results, including growth in all channels and every region of the world. By coalition Outdoor & Action Sports accelerated beyond last quarter\u2019s results with 16% growth including double-digit increases in nearly all 10 of the brands in the portfolio.", "Our Jeanswear coalition continued its momentum with a 4% revenue increase in the quarter, a result we\u2019re particularly proud of. In fact with the strengthening confidence in that business, we\u2019ve elected to take up our full year guidance -- our full year growth expectation to mid-single-digit currency neutral increase. There is definitely momentum happening at Jeanswear.", "Eight of our 10 largest brands grew during the quarter including particularly strong results for Vans, Kipling, Napapijri and JanSport, 10% growth from The North Face and Timberland and their smallest quarter of the year and another solid result from Wrangler. Across our portfolio, the fastest growing brand of the quarter award goes to Eagle Creek with 28% growth, just named as Consumer Reports top luggage brand for 2015; a big congratulations goes out to the team in Carlsbad.", "VF\u2019s direct-to-consumer business had a strong quarter as well with 13% revenue growth. Our international business which was also up 13% grew 11% Europe, 12% in the Americas region and 17% in the Asia Pacific region.", "Reported gross margin was 48.3%, down slightly due to the negative impact of foreign currency. Earnings per share, was up 22%, which in fairness was helped by about $0.02 from the expected lower tax rate but even so, without the tax benefit on a currency neutral basis, our EPS was up 17%, a very strong result in our smallest earnings quarter of the year, so strong in fact that we took up our full year EPS to $3.22 which represents 15% currency neutral earnings growth, well ahead of our 2017 planned growth rate.", "Taking a look at the first half of 2015 and there is a lot to like here. We had the strongest first half organic revenue growth since 2012; double-digit growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, direct-to-consumer and international; renewed momentum in our Jeanswear business, including strongest first half revenue performance since 2011; and double-digit increases in operating income and EPS. Needless to say, I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress we continue to make against our near and long-term objectives.", "We\u2019re delivering meaningful innovation across our portfolio, connecting even more deeply with our consumers and are tirelessly working to serve them wherever and whenever they shop and engage our brands around the world. Operationally, strategically and financially, we are stronger than we\u2019ve ever been. Powerful brands, powerful platforms, one VF with the single minded focus on delivering consistent, sustainable and profitable growth to our shareholders.", "And with that I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition and brand results and then on to Scott Roe to review our financial results. Steve, over to you.", "Steve Rendle", "Thanks, Eric.", "Let\u2019s start with Outdoor & Action Sports. With revenue up 16% on top of the 10% growth we had in the first quarter, we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that business continues to create and sustain. This quarter\u2019s growth was balanced with mid to high-teen increases in both our wholesale B2C business. And with double-digit growth in almost all 10 brands in this portfolio, we\u2019re firmly on track to achieve our 2015 currency neutral growth target.", "So, let\u2019s run through the three largest brands, starting with The North Face. Second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 10%, with strength across all channels and regions. We continue to see excellent global growth in our DTC business with revenue up 20% for the quarter.", "Turning to each region, in the Americas revenue was up at a low double-digit rate. The wholesale business grew at a high single-digit rate and B2C was up at a mid-teen rate including continued strength in our e-commerce business. With the successful of The North Face website to VF\u2019s new e-commerce platform, we\u2019re really pleased to see increased traffic and conversion particularly in mobile.", "One of the highlights of the quarter was our Mountain Athletics collection which saw strong growth including great initial results from our newly launched women\u2019s product. To promote Mountain Athletics, we launched the \u201cI Train For\u201d campaign, which featured a 30 second TV spot as well as digital and display ads that encourage consumers to share their personal journey and goals. We\u2019ve also been holding twice a week, free outdoor workouts in five major cities across the nation, reaching consumers training for everything from bucket list ski adventures, cross-country treks or elusive summit to those training to perform better in everyday life. Athletes everywhere have responded well to these sessions led by expert trainers. Still in its early days, the Mountain Athletics business is picking up momentum and is clearly helping The North Face move to a year around brand.", "During the quarter, we successfully re-launched our iconic Hedgehog hiking footwear collection, which was a very strong revenue driver. We also continue to see great response ThermoBall with incredibly strong comp and balanced men\u2019s and women\u2019s growth. The collection has quickly become a very meaningful four-season franchise.", "Now, to Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone.", "There is a lot of positive momentum going on outside the Americas, starting with The North Face. Its international business was up high single-digit percentage, driven by almost 30% growth in D2C revenue. In Europe, revenue was up the mid single-digit percentage, driven by strength in our D2C business. We also saw strength in our Mountain Athletics, Hedgehog, and ThermoBall collections. It\u2019s a great global response from consumers.", "During the quarter, we had the very unique event that further engaged consumers in the region. The North Face Lavaredo Ultra Trail race in June, so more than 1,000 participants running 75 mile, 19,000-foot elevation game course to the Italian Dolomites.", "In Asia, revenue increased at the low teen percentage, a significant growth in the DTC business. Here we continued our TNF 100 Trail Run series which drew great interest with over 12,000 participants in for Vans across the Asia Pacific region. We also rolled out our TNF road show to four locations in mainland China during the quarter and connected with more than 15,000 consumers in the province. [Ph] We continue to have great momentum in The North Face business worldwide. And as we look ahead, we are right on track to deliver low double-digit global growth for the full year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Vans.", "Steve Rendle", "Vans posted its 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which coincidentally was their growth rate for the quarter as well, 23 and 23. Now that I like a lot. There was strength across all products and channel including greater than 20% growth in both wholesale and retail which featured an impressive double-digit comp. In the Americas revenues was also up more than 20% with similar growth rates in the retail and wholesale channels. We often get asked how does Vans continued to do it? And the simple answer is the strength of our team and the strong connectivity the brand has with their consumers who are often more loyal fans than consumers. This authentic connection is earned with youth culture and then translated back through Vans with innovative trend setting products and demand creation that\u2019s both inspirational and experiential. This powerful loyalty focuses our execution and keeps us at the center of action sports, music, art and street culture.", "There were two very exciting successful product collaborations this quarter. The first was with Disney, bringing iconic characters and Vans\u2019 off-the-wall culture together across all product categories. It started with the kickoff event at Disneyland and led to really strong sell-through at both D2C and wholesale. This launch now ranks as Vans\u2019 most successful collaboration in the brand\u2019s history. Second was Vans most influential high end vault product in recent memory. The collaboration with the Takashi Murakami, the Japanese pop art icon who is a long time Vans\u2019 buff himself. The launch kicked off in men\u2019s fashion week in Paris and was widely held as the must attend event of the week. Boutiques around the world saw long lines, even people sleeping in front of stores and limited edition products sold out in a matter of hours.", "In addition to connecting with consumers through great new products, authentic and relevant consumer activations continue to be a signature of the Vans brand. The Vans Warped Tour kicked off in June bringing music, Vans culture and fans together in more than 40 stops across the U.S. and in the UK in October. And tomorrow, we\u2019ll kickoff our third year of headlining the Vans US Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach where the world\u2019s elite in surfing, skateboarding and BMX reach for the podium amid a festival wide celebration of creative expression, artist exhibits and installation.", "Now, to international.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Vans international business was up at the high teen percentage, driven by more than 35% growth in DTC and a mid teens increase in wholesale. In Europe, revenue grew at a mid teen percentage driven by more than 20% growth in DTC and double-digit growth in our wholesale business.", "We continue to be focused on elevating our story telling and energizing our product offering and we certainly achieved those goals during the quarter. The region also saw record response to the Disney and Murakami products collection.", "In Asia, Vans continued to outperform with revenue growth of more than 30%, driven by a 60% increase in DTC and more than 20% in wholesale. Tier 2 [ph] saw strong gains across all product categories and great results from the collaborations launch in the quarter.", "We also continue to bring unique cultural events to the region including the celebration of the global Go Skateboarding Day, which brought together more than 25,000 skateboarders in eight countries. We are thrilled with the continued momentum internationally for Vans. We remain on track to achieve our mid-teen growth target for the full year.", "And now onto Timberland.", "Steve Rendle", "Timberland continues to build its relevance as the year round outdoor lifestyle brand with its adaptive style that\u2019s made for the modern trail. And with the revenue increase of 10% in the second quarter, driven by a high-teen increase in global wholesale sale, we continue to be really happy with the progress the brand is making against its long-term growth target.", "In the Americas in a quarter that typically represents less than 15% of Timberland\u2019s annual revenue, the brand was up at a mid-single-digit rate with a low-teen increase in the wholesale. Boots and hikers in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s led the way. In men\u2019s it was exciting to see the success of the casual growth in collection. We\u2019re really starting to break through with true spring product.", "In women\u2019s, casual and classic boots as well as new spring sandals helped that business more than double in the quarter. As you know, we are big proponents of engaging with our consumers and helping them connect with each other. In the quarter, we launched the new timberland.com web platform with an updated look and interface that marries content and commerce. There are also great new features like Shop the Look and Quick Shop to inform style choices, inspire expression and expedite the purchase experience.", "To round this out, a hash tag in my element page has created a unique community by encouraging consumers to share photos showing how Timberland helps them live their lives to the fullest. It\u2019s a great element that was recently recognized by L2 Think Tank as one of the eight brands making the right moves with user generated content, alongside some great companies.", "On the Timberland PRO side, we continued our When Your Feet Hurt Your Work Suffers media campaign and saw particular strength in our PRO Boondock and PRO Powertrain collections. It is clear that this consumer continues to turn to Timberland to provide great innovative products for their on the job need. So, double-digit growth in the first-half and now on to the fun part of the year, definitely a lot of great things ahead for Timberland in 2015.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Timberland\u2019s international revenue was up a mid-teen percentage. In Europe, revenue was up close to 20%, strong growth in wholesale. In the men\u2019s business, SensorFlex and Cupsole products continued a strong momentum for the footwear business and the pattern was driven by positive momentum in shorts, pants and denims. The women\u2019s business in Europe was also particularly strong.", "Turning to Asia, revenue increased at the high single-digit percentage, led by strong wholesale growth. Growth in the footwear business was driven by men\u2019s casual styles and sandals and chukka styles continue to drive strong growth in women\u2019s. We also revamped our Design Your Own Footwear Customization web page which has seen positive early results. Consumers are loving the enhanced experience and features, which include extended style and color options.", "We remain on track to grow global Timberland revenue at the low-teen percentage rate for the full year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Scott and Jeanswear.", "Scott Baxter", "Thanks K.H. and good morning everyone.", "Our global Jeanswear revenue increased 4% on a currency neutral basis with positive results for both Wrangler and Lee. Overall, we have been very pleased with Jeanswear\u2019s performance. Our confidence in the business continues to grow. So much so that as Eric mentioned, we\u2019re increasing our full year outlook to a mid-single-digit increase based on our first-half performance in what we see in the second half.", "In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was up at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting healthier demand for jeans and strong results from our shirts, shorts and casual products.", "Revenue for Wrangler in the Americas was up at a high single-digit rate. A few product highlights included our No Iron Ultimate Khaki which was launched with our first ever casual focused other Fathers Day campaign. Our western business saw continued success with our Cool Vantage jeans, an innovation that maximizes breathability in hot weather and on the workwear side Wrangler Riggs exceeded our expectations for the quarter and with plans to roll this product out to additional doors in the third quarter, we\u2019re excited to see this collection gain better visibility and traction.", "Turning to Lee, similar to the first quarter, the Americas business was down at a low single-digit rate with the mid-single-digit increase in the U.S. market offset by weakness in South America. In the States, we continue to see momentum in our modern series product for men and in women\u2019s the introduction of shorts, capris and jackets made with performance fabrics has been well received. We also recently signed ESPN\u2019s Mike & Mike as spokesman for the Lee brand and are excited for that campaign to launch next month. So there is a lot of great tractions in the Jeanswear Americas business and we\u2019re excited to get into the second half of the year.", "K.H.?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "Our international Jeanswear business was up a mid-single-digit percentage driven by a low double-digit increase in Asia and flat results in Europe. In Europe, revenues for Wrangler were down at the mid-single-digit percentage due to ongoing weakness in Eastern Europe. In the quarter, Wrangler had a very successful collaboration with Leatherman which drove great brand awareness and consumer engagement. Lee posted its ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Europe with a mid-single-digit increase, driven by new women\u2019s product and continued response to our Contemporary offering. So, good momentum there.", "In Asia, our Wrangler business was up more than 20%. We continue to focus on the denim performance range and we launched Sun Shield product in key market as well. We also launched our Proud to Be Blue Line, which celebrates the Wrangler heritage. At Lee, we saw a low double-digit growth including great response to our innovative Jade Fusion denim, which manages hit and moisture much better than regular denim. Taken together we have great momentum with our Jeanswear business globally, expected to continue throughout the year.", "Now, back to Scott on Imagewear.", "Scott Baxter", "Thank you, K.H. Imagewear revenue was flat for the quarter with a mid single-digit increase in our Licensed Sports Group business being offset by a low single-digit decline in our workwear business. In our LSG business, we launched our new Cool Base jersey for all 30 MLB clubs to a great response, with a strong activation campaign, featuring celebrities from the worlds of sports and music. And on the workwear side, Red Kap showed good growth driven by shop pants and shorts. However, Bulwark had a meaningful slowdown due to reduced oil and gas exploration. For the full year, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth for this coalition.", "And now, back to Steve.", "Steve Rendle", "Our Sportswear business was up 1%, reflecting a low single-digit decrease for Nautica\u2019s business and a 20% growth from Kipling but apart from Kipling, which clearly had another great quarter, the numbers behind Nautica don\u2019t paint the full picture. Along with the strategy in brand positioning reset that\u2019s well underway including a deep consumer insight study, the work we began a few quarters ago to increase AURs and pursue more full price revenue in lieu of promotion driven sales, is working. It\u2019s also clearly showing up in our profitability. And with that said, we are maintaining this coalition\u2019s revenue outlook of mid single-digit growth for the full year.", "And to wrap up our coalition comments, revenue in our Contemporary brand business declined 5% as the overall Contemporary category especially here in the U.S. remains that. Globally a low double-digit increase in international revenue was more than offset by a low double-digit decline in the Americas region. In U.S. despite the top line performance, we did see sequential improvement in our jeans business with sales stabilizing in the quarter. That said however, given the year-to-date results, we are now expecting revenue for this coalition to be down at a mid single-digit currency neutral rate for the year.", "And now on to Scott with a deeper dive into our results.", "Scott Roe", "Thanks, Steve. I echo Eric\u2019s comments by saying that our second quarter and first half year results speak to the continued strength of our diverse portfolio of brands and our business model. We remain focused on a executing our strategic plan, which includes delivering innovative products, maintaining a strong connection with our consumers, and strategically investing in our brands. And as a result, we have delivered yet another solid quarter that supports our long-term growth commitments.", "In the second quarter, on a currency neutral basis, our revenue rose 10% which is an acceleration of the 8% increase we saw in the first quarter and at 9% year-to-date that\u2019s solid growth for the first half of the year.", "By channel, our direct-to-consumer business grew 13% in the second quarter, reflecting strong results across all regions including a high teen increase in Europe and more than 20% growth in Asia. This performance was laid by our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition with The North Face, Vans, Kipling, and Lucy leading the way.", "In our wholesale business we also saw strong results, with revenue up at high single-digit rate with Vans, Timberland, Wrangler, JanSport, Reef and Lucy among the highest growth rates in the quarter.", "Gross margin for the second quarter was right in line with our expectations at 48.3%, down just 10 basis points the last year\u2019s result. This decrease included 50 basis points of mix benefit, which was offset by 60 basis points of foreign currency and rate. And to unpack that a bit, our mix benefit just like in the first quarter was somewhat tempered due to the higher Jeanswear revenue. Now, keep in mind, even though Jeanswear carries lower gross margins, it is still VF\u2019s most profitable coalition. So, we\u2019re okay with that flow through.", "Foreign currency changes on a year-over-year basis, including an average euro rate of 1.11 in this year\u2019s second quarter versus 1.37 rates last year, accounted for the majority of the headwinds. And finally, recall that the majority of our product costs with ties to commodities like leather, cotton and oil-based derivatives will only begin to see benefits flowing through the P&L in the second half of the year, more specifically in the fourth quarter.", "Now turning to SG&A, our SG&A ratio to revenue was up just 10 basis points due to continued investments in D2C almost entirely offset by leverage. In fact, we\u2019re operating a 139 more stores now than we did at the same time last year and that\u2019s our model: Make investments to drive top line growth, find leverage elsewhere in our expense structure and improve profitability.", "Our operating income grew 1% and operating margin in the second quarter was 8.9%, down 30 basis points due to the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding currency, operating income was up 10%, resulting in an operating margin of 9.2%.", "Looking down into that profitability by coalition, reported Outdoor & Action Sports operating income rose 3% and operating margin was 9.7%, 50 basis points below last year. This decline was entirely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency rates as about 40% of the coalition\u2019s revenue came from regions outside of the U.S. On a currency neutral basis, operating income was up 17%, slightly ahead of revenue growth.", "Operating income from Jeanswear was up 4% in the second quarter and operating margin increased 70 basis points to 17.2%. Excluding the impact of currency, operating income was up 5% also ahead of revenue growth. We are really pleased with the global strength we\u2019re seeing return to this business.", "Imagewear operating income was flat with a 10 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.2%, held back a bit because of the unfavorable changes in foreign currency. Without the impact of currency, operating income was up 2%.", "Sportswear operating income was up 41% while operating margin improved 290 basis points to 10.2% as the move towards higher quality sales began to gain traction. And Contemporary brand\u2019s operating income was down significantly as this category remains challenged.", "And now on to the bottom line. Our EPS grew 22% on a currency neutral basis. And as Eric mentioned, the result was helped by about $0.02 due to a lower tax rate which included settlements of prior year\u2019s tax audits. While we expected this tax settlement as part of our annual outlook, the fact that it came in our smallest EPS quarter, certainly shows up nicely. And even if you take it out, we were still up 17% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, EPS was up 11%.", "Turning now to some balance sheet highlights. Our inventories were up 8%, which is in line with our expectations ahead of the second half of the year when we were realized about 60% of our revenue. And finally, our Board of Directors declared a $0.32 quarterly dividend, payable in the third quarter.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our full year outlook beginning with the top line. We continue to expect currency neutral revenue to be up 8% in 2015, consistent with our 2017 commitment. On a reported basis, we expect revenue for the full year to be about $12.7 billion. Based on first half performance, we did make a couple of changes to our full year currency neutral revenue expectations for two of our coalition. As previous mentioned, we\u2019re taking Jeanswear up to mid single digit increase from our previous expectation of low single digit growth and we\u2019re taking Contemporary brands down to a mid single digit decline from the previous nearly flat outlook.", "Our gross margin expectation for 2015 remains about 49.5% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting the 70 basis-point increase over 2014. The primary driver of our gross margin expansion remains the favorable mix shift to our higher margin businesses which we\u2019ve seen for so many years. This is a trend we expect will continue.", "Taking a look at currency assumptions, we\u2019ve elected to keep our euro to U.S. dollar assumption at 1.10 [ph] for the balance of the year. At this rate, a $0.05 move would translate into a revenue impact of about $60 million and an EPS impact of $0.03 to $0.04 for the second half of the year. Outside of the euro, which represents 40% of our foreign currency basket, other currencies have continued to devalue against the U.S. dollar. So with this additional pressure in the second half of the year, full year reported gross margin could be about 49%.", "Moving now to the bottom line. We expect earnings per share on a currency neutral basis to increase 15%, up from the previous expectation of 14% as compared to last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $3.08. On a reported basis, despite the negative impact from foreign currency, we now expect EPS growth of 5% to get us to $3.22 versus last year\u2019s adjusted EPS. This compares to our previous EPS guidance of $3.20, which reflected a 4% growth outlook. This places us even further ahead of our 2017 place and in fact is a nice stairstep acceleration in the first three years of our plan, plus 13% in year one, 14% in year two and now plus 15% in year three. That\u2019s not too bad.", "Now, let\u2019s see how we see the second half playing out. For the third quarter, we expect currency neutral and reported revenue to increase at nearly the same rates as the second quarter. Now keep in mind the third quarter is the biggest international quarter of the year and therefore our most significant FX exposure. In fact, given current rates, we see the potential for about 70 basis points of foreign currency headwinds impacting our operating margin in the third quarter.", "For the fourth quarter, we see revenue growth at a slightly lower rate than the third quarter as we will be up against a comparable period in 2014 that included a 53rd week. The fourth quarter will also see the strongest margin and profit comparisons for the year when D2C is at its peak, the negative impact of currency moderates, and we begin to see the impact of lower product costs.", "So to wrap it up, there are a lot of green lights as we look out across our portfolio and our execution only continues to get stronger. The initiatives and investments we have in place combined with the power of our diverse portfolio of brands are positioning us to achieve growth targets that we view as pretty strong, when you stack us up against the industry as a whole. Equally as important is our proven track record of delivering steady earnings growth that we believe clearly illustrates the strength of our business model and consistent return to our shareholders. After posting a strong first half, we now have an even greater level of confidence as we enter the second half of 2015.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ed Yruma", "I guess first on the Jeanswear business, obviously nice performance there. How do we think about the drivers of that business? And then second, the instrumentality from a margin perspective. I know it\u2019s lower gross but are there certain benefits as that growth rate accelerates? And then finally, with the Nautica reboot, you\u2019ve done these a number of times. I guess how should we think about timing and cadence of that process?", "Scott Baxter", "So from a Jeanswear standpoint, we\u2019re seeing denim trend up a little bit so that\u2019s been real positive for us. You\u2019ve seen that this is the third quarter in a row that we\u2019ve had mid single-digit increases. But if you think about Jeanswear, this is the culmination of a lot of things.", "First of all, it is our new innovative products that are coming to market. We\u2019ve been on an innovation process pipeline now for about five years and you\u2019re starting to see some of that come out of our pipeline. You are starting to see things like Cool Vantage, which we just kicked off here about 45 days ago to tremendous success. That\u2019s part of the pipeline, that\u2019s part of the creation that we\u2019ve had and that\u2019s starting to come out and we are seeing really good success. You are also seeing expanded distribution, Ed. You are seeing that our consumers want to see our products in different and more channels because we\u2019re just really connecting with them. An example of that would be in the mid-tier where you are seeing Wrangler really do very, very well. In addition to that, we have really gotten our demand creation platform harmonized with our businesses.", "So, we are pretty excited about what is going to happen in the second half of this year because we are kicking off in the Lee business Mike & Mike from ESPN. And then we have a really strong Advanced Comfort platform coming up from Drew Brees on the Wrangler side.", "And I think for me the big benefit has been the real strong leadership that we\u2019ve seen from our team at both Wrangler and Lee and just the excitement around our products and our people and our innovations.", "Scott Roe", "I guess just on the model, it is a great model is the short answer. We have relatively lower margins when you compare to average VF but it\u2019s a very efficient machine and we see", "a lot of leverage. So when we get the top-line moving, that leverage drives profitability. And remember, it\u2019s already our most profitable coalition at almost 19%.", "Steve Rendle", "Then on your Nautica question, real quick. We\u2019re really at the front end of this work. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve just finished our consumer segmentation study and that\u2019s beginning to inform everything to do with our brand positioning and our brand strategy which flows through our product and go-to-market strategy. So from a timing and what can you expect is really over the -- I think you will continue to see improvement over the next 12 months to 18 months as our team really locks onto this new model, new strategy and the product machine is able to start putting the differentiated product into the segmentation strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti", "Eric, I guess jump ball Eric or Scott. You guys had much better trends in the revenue growth in the quarter in constant currency. I\u2019m curious why you didn\u2019t feel like taking up the revenue growth overall for the year. Maybe you could help connect that decision to what you are seeing in the backlogs for the fall and holiday, and maybe if you see the same trends in the direct-to-consumer business you are seeing in the enthusiasm for the backlog in your wholesale customers. Is that what you would look at and say okay, we\u2019ve got room there to then maybe raise the guidance for the year at that point?", "Eric Wiseman", "Michael, it is a great question and something we talked about a lot. The math works; you know how this works that all the numbers between 7.5% and 8.5% round to 8% as we report our numbers. So, there is $127 million gap there on $12.7 billion business and we actually -- our revenue outlook is a little stronger but the number is still eight is the way to deal with that I think. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by how the back half looks. Scott mentioned in his comments that the back half \u2013 we\u2019re up against the back half that had an important 53rd week last year. So that\u2019s part of the dynamic as well. But we are seeing growth in both our wholesale and retail business around the world in our big brands and it\u2019s very encouraging as we have a lot of our bookings in for fall and we have pretty good visibility to the numbers.", "Scott Roe", "Maybe just building on that, as you try to model this out, obviously the top line as Eric said is incrementally better. Given our FX environment and our history of tightly controlling expenses, that means we are driving leverage. And so the couple of pennies that we took up in terms of bottom line, that\u2019s really where that\u2019s coming from.", "Michael Binetti", "And Eric, it seems like you\u2019re ready to have a basis point argument with me on revenues there. So thanks for that. If we just look at the gross margin line and start thinking ahead to 2016 a bit, you guys have told us about -- you guys have mentioned a couple of times how you\u2019re getting close to your five-year margin target early but obviously FX has gotten a lot different since then. Maybe you could help us think about the 60 to 70 basis points of mix you guys get every year, how should we lay currency on top of that as we look at next year, and then also any comment you could give us on how you\u2019re thinking about price increases as you get into that FX pressure?", "Eric Wiseman", "I think that was like five or six questions, Michael.", "Michael Binetti", "Perhaps.", "Eric Wiseman", "And you know the first answer I\u2019m going to give you which is we\u2019re not going to give guidance into \u201816 at this point but there is a few things I can say, Michael. So first of all, currency has impacted us this year, as we said about 60 basis points and that\u2019s essentially offset by the mix benefit that we see and then a little bit of input cost is the rest of the delta to get there for 2015. But pricing has always been a part of our quiver of arrows I guess as we attack things like commodity price and currency and there is no reason to believe that wouldn\u2019t be true in the future.", "The other thing I always like to point out on this topic is, in any given season, more than 50% of our products are new, each time. So when we talk about price, it\u2019s really merchandising to a known value as opposed to necessarily raising the price on a like for like basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane", "My first question was on the roll out of your brands in China. And just has there been any change in strategy there given the environment?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "No, no change in strategy. I think we all heard the news recently; there was some noise in economy. And our strategy stays unchanged. I always say that very consistently, this is a marathon; it\u2019s not a short-term race. We actively work at the moment with four brands which are our major focus. I said it in the past we still have opportunities in a number of stores. I gave the number compared and benchmarked big players. We still have a lot of room there and also we had a relatively good quarter. Our comps are strong; so it\u2019s really good feedback from China at the moment.", "Kate McShane", "You may have given this, I may have missed it. But did you give a comp growth number for your DTC business in your prepared comments?", "Eric Wiseman", "We did not but I\u2019ll make a brief comment on that. As we look at our D2C business in total, we think we\u2019re going to grow low to mid single-digit in our brick and mortar stores and we have talked about high-single-digit comp growth in our overall D2C. And that\u2019s really pulled up by the rapid growth of our e-commerce business which has been and continues to be up over 30%. So when you put those two together, low to mid-single-digit comps in brick and mortar and up 30% in e-com, we get to a high-single-digit comp number in our D2C business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.", "Matthew Boss", "So, on your longer-term objectives, split adjusted 2017 earnings target would be about 4.50 in earnings. Are you -- I guess higher level, are you so comfortable with this? And if we don\u2019t see an acquisition which you have some embedded in that, are there other levers to think about to be able to get us there?", "Eric Wiseman", "Sure. When we announced the 4.50 earnings per share target, we said at that time that we weren\u2019t really relying on a big contribution from acquisitions to get to that number. The fact is we aren\u2019t and as Scott pointed out, our three-year trend in EPS growth, we were assuming a 13% compounded EPS growth to get there and our numbers are 13, 14 and we\u2019re now guiding to \u201815 this year on a constant currency basis. What\u2019s changed is when we gave the 4.50, we said we were expecting no change from FX, FX wouldn\u2019t affect that. We pegged at whatever the rate was at that time and obviously we have an FX headwind this year.", "What\u2019s going to happen for the next few years from an FX standpoint, I can\u2019t comment on, we don\u2019t know. But organically, we are driving greater than the planned organic growth rate in our EPS. So, how you think about that? I don\u2019t know what to tell you because I don\u2019t know what the foreign currency exchange rates are going to be for the next 30 months. We\u2019re exactly halfway through our five-year plan sitting here right now.", "Matthew Boss", "And then just a follow-up, so as the balance sheet continues to build here, anything new to think about on the capital allocation front, more so if we didn\u2019t see an acquisition by say the midpoint of next year, is it fair to think about maybe a larger or more consistent share repurchase? Would you look to return cash to shareholders maybe in a different fashion?", "Eric Wiseman", "Matthew, I would say this: There is no change in our position which has been consistent. Acquisitions remains our number one priority, dividends is the following and then we have said consistently we won\u2019t let cash accumulate; we\u2019ll return that to shareholders as we\u2019ve done over $1.3 billion over the last couple of years. So, if we had cash accumulate as I said, we would absolutely not let it sit there, we would find a way to return that back to shareholders.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy", "My question is a big picture question about the portfolio of brands as a whole. A few brands nicely ahead of pace relative to 2017 targets, a few laggards; I suppose that\u2019s the benefits of having a portfolio. We are seeing DTC ahead of pace. The world has changed quite a bit in the past few years with the pace at which consumers are embracing shopping directly with the strong brands. Given this kind of new world order, can you provide some updated perspective on strategies to shape the portfolio, how you think about those brands that are laggards? That\u2019d be helpful.", "Eric Wiseman", "I\u2019m going to respond to that in a couple of ways, Jim. One thing we are seeing is that our D2C business worldwide is running at a -- is going to be a bigger percentage of our company than we originally thought. It\u2019s grown about 200 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue over the last couple of years. We did have an accounting change there that affected that but it\u2019s looking like that could continue to -- that could hit 30% of our total revenue in the next couple of years. So that is different, consumers are engaging with us as I said earlier to an earlier question, primarily through our e-commerce sites which are very compelling, getting bigger and we have them in more countries.", "As regards to the shape of the portfolio, it\u2019s something that we look at all the time and we want to be in a position 5, 10 years from now where we have a compelling and a relevant portfolio. I can\u2019t comment specifically about how we\u2019re thinking about adding to that portfolio or subtracting to that portfolio. It\u2019d be an appropriate comment to make. But it is something we manage.", "Jim Duffy", "Can you speak in any general terms about things you would be more likely to add to the portfolio or the characteristics of how you\u2019re trying to shape the portfolio, what you\u2019d like to emphasize and what are some things you are less interested in emphasizing?", "Eric Wiseman", "You have heard us talk over time about our focus on the Outdoor & Action Sports space and those activity-based brands are where we are best and growing the most and investing the most. We invest disproportionately them in brand spend and we invest disproportionately them in new stores and new stores and e-commerce sites because we like the characteristics of them and the stickiness with consumers when we are helping them live out their lives doing the activities they like to do.", "So, you will see us invest in that type of thing in our portfolio beginning with an emphasis on Outdoor & Action Sports.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.", "David Glick", "Scott, just a question -- I just want to make sure I understand your comments on the gross margin and profit progression for the balance of the year. You said that FX was a little bit greater in Q3, but also you have some of your higher margin brands have a higher penetration as well. Should we think about the gross margin progression Q3 being kind of similar, maybe a little bit better relative to last year in Q3 and then the big increase over last year in Q4 and the same for EBIT and EPS? Is that the right way to think about it?", "Scott Roe", "I think that\u2019s generally right. We are not being that specific, but I think in terms of the shape you listened well.", "David Glick", "And then tax rate is still around 24%, is that fair?", "Scott Roe", "That\u2019s right, about 24%.", "David Glick", "The last question on Jeanswear, it sounds like you have a lot of new product initiatives. And I am just wondering, is this part of a broader improvement in the overall denim market? There\u2019s certainly been a lot of discussion about that. Obviously, you guys are doing a lot of things right but I am just wondering has the demand sort of bottomed out in the category and really starting to recover overall? Is this a rising tide in addition to some of the strategies you guys are successfully implementing?", "Steve Rendle", "David, I think it\u2019s a little bit of all of what you said. The market is definitely improving. We have seen a little bit of additional demand around denim. But I think the single most important thing is our folks are really doing a good job as far as helping accelerate that demand with their consumers and with our wholesale customers. We are bringing products to market that the consumer really likes. We\u2019ve got our new Heavenly Touch, our Advanced Comfort, our Dream Jean and even I mentioned earlier talking about the Cool Vantage; 9t is", "a product that hasn\u2019t really been addressed in the marketplace before and we brought it all the way through our innovation pipeline over the last three to four years, came to market with it here and it\u2019s been a tremendous success.", "So, it is not just that, it\u2019s the additional piece and the additional piece is when you bring a product to market that the consumer finds that they have a need for, you have success. And we\u2019re really listening to the consumer with our insight process and we are bringing those things to market and the consumers finding them. And we just have to have a bigger voice; going forward from a demand creation and you heard me talk about some of the things that we are doing there to go ahead and highlight those products and highlight our brands. So, as you combine both of those factors, I think it is really good for our Jeanswear business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "So, two weeks ago on -- The Wall Street Journal highlighted that VF Corp is one of the brand leaders out there looking at Africa as the next frontier from a sourcing standpoint. Can you provide any insights regarding your geographic sourcing strategy going forward? And how should we think about labor cost pressures this year and longer term from a gross margin standpoint?", "Eric Wiseman", "For as long as I\u2019ve been here and I have been here for 20 years, our supply chain strategy about sourcing product has always been to have a balanced portfolio of countries that we can create our products in, not chasing lowest cost but chasing the best business model for us. As a result of that, we are spread pretty wide in terms of the regions of the world and number of countries that we have facilities in that we either own and operate or that we source from including a small presence in Africa. Africa is a place that interests us. It is emerging on the scene and as the article said it is kind of a new place for the apparel and footwear industry to go to and we are there in a very small way trying to learn what role that may have in our future.", "I am going to take a step back from that and as we look from -- look for places to source; cost is not the first place, thing that we look for. We have to first have the quality of products made. If the products -- it doesn\u2019t do us any good to get an inexpensive product that doesn\u2019t have great quality, that\u2019s bad for our brands. Second thing we look for is working conditions. We won\u2019t source products in a place that doesn\u2019t have good working conditions for the people that work in those factories.", "The third thing we look for is service. So now we have quality of the products, good working conditions and a place that can service our demand and then the last thing we look for is cost in that order. And to the extent countries can tick those boxes in that order, we go there.", "Laurent Vasilescu", "Continuing on the sourcing theme, can you provide an update on The Third Way of manufacturing? I think the last time we heard about the third way was during the 2013 Investor Day, so hoping to get a little bit of an update on that initiative in terms of the potential for gross margins going forward.", "Eric Wiseman", "The Third Way is -- giving a Reader\u2019s Digest version, one way to produce is in factories that we own and operate; the second is in a factory that\u2019s purely a third-party relationship; and the third way is in a factory where we have a strategic alliance with the factory bringing everything we know about making product into a factory that\u2019s owned and operated by somebody else. That was an idea three or four years ago. We have some of those set up around the world and we have one of those set up or a couple of those set up now in Bangladesh. And it is a place where we find that we can take an attractive -- a potentially attractive factory in a market that meets all the criteria I said, and make it even better because we are pretty good manufacturing operators ourselves, have a lot of tricks up our sleeves and we share them with some of those factories and that model will continue to see more of that. I can\u2019t speak to what percentages of our products come out of that today but it\u2019s a growing percentage.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Telsey", "Can you talk a little bit about as you think of marketing investment for the back half of the year, how does it differ by coalition, what should we be seeing? And just lastly on the jeans side, mid-tier department store performance, how did that look and was there any change?", "Scott Roe", "Our demand creation is growing a little bit faster than our top line. So, just in terms of modeling it out, we continue to make those investments but importantly we are also improving the effectiveness of those investments. We are making those dollars work better. I will give you one simple example, we have had 14 global media agencies and we have embarked on our project to really look at rationalizing that, getting more leverage, the power of one VF. And as a result, we have taken that 14 down to 3 and that\u2019s resulting in tens of millions of dollars of savings over several years. And that\u2019s really a way to just put those dollars to work in a more effective way.", "Steve Rendle", "From a mid-tier standpoint Dana, I think there are two things I would like to talk about. One is we brought Wrangler to the mid-tier and it has been extremely successful. What I mentioned earlier is our consumer is asking for our product in different channels and that just tells us the strength of the brand that we have and we brought that product to that channel. It has resonated extremely well and we are rolling it out across the channel across the United States with great success.", "And then on the female side, we are bringing real innovation to the channel. So not just around denim. I think the thing that\u2019s really interesting and really exciting for the Lee brand is we are bringing some different fabrications and some different performance type products that have been really successful from a female standpoint and the consumer has really liked that in that channel too. So that\u2019s a little bit on the male and a little bit on the female within the channel but we feel really good about what is happening in the second half and what we have in our innovation pipeline going forward.", "Eric Wiseman", "It\u2019s absolutely fair to say that how to do this because I want to talk about a specific mid-tier retailer. But is the mid-tier sector healthier than it was two years ago? You bet it is. Is it healthier than it was last year? Yes, it is. Where is that going to go? I don\u2019t know but those retailers in that space have been working really hard to become relevant and to get momentum and they are getting some traction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad", "I wanted to follow up on Michael\u2019s question on FX. I know you are not giving guidance for next year but just wanted to get a better understanding of kind of the key drivers on the transactional side as your hedges roll off for later this year, next year. Is it price, merchandising by far the two biggest components, levers you can pull to manage through that? Is there supply chain efficiencies or product costs coming down or raw materials? Just help me think how to order that and are you still comfortable that you will largely be able to handle that issue, that FX issue?", "Scott Roe", "Omar, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the answer is all of the above are true, all those are levers. And I always just -- when we have this discussion, I always encourage people don\u2019t isolate too much on one single component of our input cost because the reality is the markets are pretty efficient, we see commodities now trending down, we see currency going the other way. It\u2019s really hard to predict how all of those factors are going to come together. But that\u2019s why we have hedging programs and that\u2019s why we enter into longer term relationships and contracts so that we can see those coming and design and merchandise around those known input costs.", "And pricing is absolutely a lever. I made the point earlier in the call that it is not necessarily like for like items although that will be part of the equation but really I would say merchandising and the mix and the innovation that we are bringing to market that we get paid for, all those things together mix to allow us to maintain our margins. The other thing I always say too is while the speed with which currency change this time is a little unprecedented, the fact that it is changing and the relative amount is not unprecedented. We manage this every quarter and the best evidence of our ability to do it going forward is the fact that we have done it for many years in the past.", "So, I think a lot of those factors are going to come to bear, Omar. And we see our model is intact and we see no reason why we wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome these headwinds.", "Omar Saad", "Eric, I want to ask a question, I heard you mention Eagle Creek is one of the fastest-growing brands. You\u2019ve got a number of smaller brands in the portfolio that don\u2019t get as much attention, Napapijri and I know Kipling is doing really well, Reef is one we haven\u2019t heard about in a while. Should we think about these smaller brands; are they all seem to be coming together and starting to reach a critical mass maybe not individually but as a whole as kind of another leg of growth, organic growth for the company? Is that the right way to think about or are they still too small as we think about the broader portfolio?", "Eric Wiseman", "Yes, you\u2019re right, we tend to focus on our big brands because our big brands move the needle for us and that\u2019s how we talk on these calls. We have a lot of smaller brands that are doing fantastically well. A brand like Kipling which was a brand we don\u2019t talk about much, it was a small brand; it is approaching the size that Vans was when we acquired it. So it is becoming not such a small brand and it is growing. It is one of our fastest growing brands consistently over the last four years. So that\u2019s just one. Napapijri is another one that you called out. We are having great growth in that brand. Eagle Creek is a very small brand for us but a really important brand in the outdoor luggage space and for Consumer Reports readers to have discovered it and name it the Best Luggage Brand of 2015 is remarkable. And I couldn\u2019t be more proud of that group. And we think all those brands have runway and collectively they are an important part of our growth story.", "Omar Saad", "Can you give us a sense of the size combined Napapijri, Kipling, Reef, Eagle Creek and any others that I am missing in that genre?", "Eric Wiseman", "I couldn\u2019t do that accurately in my head on this call. It might be a conversation we have later.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "I wanted to ask about Mountain Athletics and just get a better sense of number one, what kind of distribution that initiative is getting? And maybe Steve, you could talk to clearly breaking into training and sort of outside of the outdoor part of action would be a pretty big new category to tap into. And I was just curious from your consumer insights work what your consumers telling you that how you would position North Face in that category in order to really take off?", "Steve Rendle", "Mountain Athletics is a very important new line extension, new collection that The North", "Face has been focusing on. It is really important in being able to spread The North Face beyond its second half concentration into becoming a true 12-month out of the year brand. And our consumer insights is what really has led the team to the way it is positioned. And you heard me talk about in my comments; it is about training for the activities that are relevant to The North Face consumer. It could be that ski adventure, climbing, a long hike that someone has been focused on or if you are just part of that focused consumer group in your everyday life, it is a method of training that really resonates with you.", "We see the distribution opportunity being very consistent with where the brand is distributed today. Specialty retail is an important part but where we are seeing very good placement and very good sell-through is in the sporting goods channel. The department store piece, which is smaller for the brand absolutely has seen good placement. And then our own D2C and specifically e-commerce where we are able to really present the brand, present the collection and the theory behind Mountain Athletics training, we have seen really good strong growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "And Lindsay, just to give you an international point of view, we just launched it a little bit later than in the U.S.; it is in the market right now and the sellout data are phenomenal, really doing well.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann", "And just a follow-up for both Timberland and Vans, can you talk about how momentum has been in apparel versus footwear? Are you seeing increased strength in apparel as you focused on that offering or is it kind of balanced growth?", "Steve Rendle", "So, I will start with Vans. As you saw, they had a spectacular quarter yet again and that\u2019s broad-based. It is across all categories, all genders and all channels and regions. So, apparel is growing as a very important element of that brand\u2019s go-to-market strategy and the collaborations that they have brought to market. Disney wasn\u2019t just a footwear collaboration; it came to life in apparel in a really unique and fun way. And at Timberland, continues to be a big focus for us. As I have said before, we are just beginning to get placement and penetration here in the U.S. market. Our greatest go-to-market presence is within our own retail. And it is an important focus. It is part of the three areas that we have committed to really drive, men\u2019s footwear, women\u2019s footwear, and men\u2019s apparel. So really happy with both businesses\u2019 apparel growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with B. Riley.", "Mitch Kummetz", "So Eric, you\u2019re now expecting stronger 8% growth this year. I think the only coalition that you formally raised the growth rate was Jeanswear. I am curious on Outdoor & Action Sports. The plan is double-digit growth. Are you now kind of assuming stronger double-digit growth for the year given how strong that coalition was for the quarter?", "Eric Wiseman", "No comment on outdoor growth for the back half of the year. I will remind you, Mitch that particularly at The North Face, the 53rd week last year was extremely helpful. You might remember in the first quarter of this year we talked about the slowdown in the growth rate of The North Face. It was because they traded the first week of January for the first week of April. And obviously The North Face model first week of January is more important than the first week of April. But we are up against that in our growth rates for fall. We are not taking our guidance up on outdoor or action sports but we are very pleased with where we are positioned right now.", "Mitch Kummetz", "And then Scott, just on reconciling the earnings guidance again, the sales assumption is essentially the same although again maybe a little bit stronger 8% growth. Gross margin has come down a little bit. EPS bumps up a couple of pennies. Is it really on the SG& A side that we should see kind of the improvement? I think you mentioned tax is the same. Does share count come down at all and does Jeanswear impact kind of the model since you are now expecting more Jeanswear growth for the year and that\u2019s lower gross margin, lower SG&A?", "Scott Roe", "I think it was all in there, Mitch, but you nailed it. It is really leverage on SG&A is really what you need to make your model work because all of the other factors -- shares are the same; we said about 24 on the tax rate. Obviously we talked about the gross margin. So the difference is that higher volume is driving leverage. And remember that Jeanswear business, that\u2019s their model, relatively low margins based on the channels they play in. And they drive volume and that drops right to the bottom line. That\u2019s why we see that 19% or so operating income for Jeanswear.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank.", "David Weiner", "So, just my two questions, I guess first, I was hoping regarding Europe, you could maybe give a little more color by geography? If you could do that, maybe kind of what is working better or if there are any regions that are kind of lagging if you will? And then in the U.S., are there any callouts in terms of stores that are located in heavier tourist markets? Are you being impacted by tourist inflows into the States?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "David, maybe I start with Europe. As you heard us saying, we had a strong quarter, up 11%. I guess the good news is most of our brands in the portfolio were growing so from a brand point of view. That\u2019s the first point. The second one, we see good strength in most of the geographies. It\u2019s not just bumping in one area so all over. In Southern Europe, particularly strong; it is good in the Scandinavian piece and the UK, also the Greater German area; and even Greece. I looked into Greece. Even if it is small for us, we have a subsidiary there but that\u2019s a few percent up to last year\u2019s which is really surprising considering what\u2019s going on in that market.", "David Weiner", "The Greek comp. Okay.", "Eric Wiseman", "That\u2019s going to put us over the top for the year, I am sure.", "Steve Rendle", "And then David, to your tourist question. We have seen those large tourist markets of Southern Florida, New York and to some degree Las Vegas, impacted by that international tourist. What is interesting is the offset is we\u2019re seeing really strong comps in our international retail as that consumer stays home. I think the important thing to remember, the D2C is a smaller percentage of our total revenue, strong wholesale base and very balanced and broad platform by which our businesses drive their revenue.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger", "David, we are happy that we get a few American tourists more now in Europe.", "Eric Wiseman", "Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We\u2019re thrilled with how the quarter played out with currency neutral growth of 10% on the top line and 22% on the bottom line. I hope you sensed our confidence as we face the back half of this year which is when most of our business comes together but we are confident. Look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Ben Shamsian - Sterne Agee", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the VF Corporation Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.", "Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's third quarter 2015 results.", "I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed and documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be in currency neutral terms. By our definition, which is detailed in our press release issued at 6:55 Eastern Time this morning, currency neutral amount excludes both, the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate exchanges on foreign currency denominated transactions.", "You may also here us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. We've chosen to use currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussions, because we feel it more accurately represents true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.", "Joining us on today's call will be Eric Wiseman, VF Chairman and CEO; Steve Rendle, President and COO; Scott Roe, our CFO; and VF Executives Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter.", "Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourselves to two questions per caller.", "Thank you. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We have much to discuss so I'll dive right in. You'll hear today that we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results in the year that operationally is one of our strongest ever; you'll hear about how the power of our diverse brands, channels and geographies are used to connect with consumers around the world; and you'll hear some caution about certain parts of the external environment. What you will not hear is a lack of confidence in our ability to be successful in the short-term and the power we have to deliver consistent long-term value to shareholders.", "In the third quarter, currency neutral revenue was up 8%, which was a bit softer than we had anticipated 90 days ago and reflective of the current retail environment. However, our five largest brands collectively grew 11%, and we saw growth in all channels in every region of the world.", "Coalition highlights include: Outdoor & Action Sports, which was up 13% with nearly the same growth rate in both D2C and wholesale and Jeanswear, which posted its fourth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single digit growth including higher results for both Wrangler and Lee in all channels in nearly every region around the world.", "Our fastest-growing brand of the quarter award goes to SmartWool with 33% growth. SmartWool is one of the unsung jewels in our portfolio and the team out in Steamboat Springs is doing great work.", "VF's international business was up 9% with a 5% increase in Europe and 19% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 12% growth in Asia-Pacific, including 16% growth in China.", "Our direct-to-consumer business was up 8% with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by D2C weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary.", "On a currency neutral basis, our gross margin improved 60 basis points to 48.9% due to benefits from product cost and the continued mix shift to higher-margin businesses. However, reported gross margin was down 40 basis points to 47.9% as we realized 100 basis points of foreign currency headwinds, which was about 30 basis points higher than the outlook we provided in July. Taking that through to the bottom-line, our currency neutral earnings per share were up 14%, which has us right on track to deliver 15% earnings growth for the full year.", "While we do see some choppiness in certain parts of the current environment, our third quarter results and outlook for the full year give me great confidence in our sector and in VF's long-term ability to outperform the market by focusing on what we do best \u2013 deepening our consumer connections and driving innovation to strengthen our brands and proactively managing our business to ensure we continue to create value for our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz, and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition and brand results, and then on to Scott Roe to review our financial results. Steve, it's over to you.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Eric. Outdoor & Action Sports revenue was up 13% in the third quarter, driven by nearly the same growth rate in wholesale and D2C. This performance puts us right on track to achieve our full-year expectation of a low-double digit currency neutral increase.", "So let's walk through some of the highlights from our three largest brands, starting with The North Face. The third quarter revenue was up 11% globally with a similar growth rate in both wholesale and D2C. In the Americas region, despite later in the quarter deliveries and a warmer start to autumn, revenue was up at a low-double digit rate, including low-teens growth in wholesale and a high-single digit increase in D2C. Our product success runs deep at The North Face and the third quarter was no exception with particular strength in our ThermoBall, Summit Series, Mountain Athletics, and Ultra collections.", "ThermoBall has now expanded into men's, women's, kid's and footwear with an amazingly unique color and print pallet to meet consumer demand for trend forward, three-season, lightweight performance product.", "Just last week, we re-launched Summit Series, our pinnacle line of elite Alpine equipment, which features a six-piece layering system for both men and women, giving us confidence that we are once again resetting the bar of what it takes to empower mountaineering athletes to perform even more effectively in the world's harshest environments. And when they're not on the dirt, rock, snow, or ice, our Mountain Athletics training collection has also expanded its offering and it's becoming the go-to brand for multi-environment athletes who train for more than a game.", "Rounding it out is our Ultra footwear collection for the outdoor athletes who run, hike and train, giving them the exact spec, support and reliability they need to push the boundaries of what's possible. Overall, we're really proud of our footwear business.", "We also debuted our Never Stop global advertising campaign in late-September. This campaign encourages people everywhere to find something they love about the outdoors and to relentlessly pursue it. Not only is this our biggest and most exciting brand campaign to-date, but it's truly the first time we've run a single unified global spot, so an amazing opportunity for us to drive brand awareness and strengthen loyalty with our core consumers.", "Now, to Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The North Face European business was up at the low-single digit rate, driven by more than a 20% increase in our D2C business and stable results in wholesale.", "We also saw strength in our ThermoBall and Mountain Athletics collections. And footwear has performed well, with standout performances from our Hedgehog product. During the quarter, we launched TNF mobile sites in the U.K., Germany and France. And we rolled out a number of key partner brand stores throughout Europe.", "In Asia, revenue increased at the high-teen rate driven by more than 20% wholesale growth. During the quarter, we launched a ThermoBall head-to-toe collection, supported by a strong social media campaign. We also opened our second Asian urban exploration test store in Hong Kong with very strong results.", "We are pleased with the strong momentum in The North Face global business and are on track to deliver low-double digit growth for the full year.", "Now, let's turn to Vans.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Global revenue for Vans was up 10% in the third quarter with a high-teen increase in D2C sales and a mid-single digit increase in wholesale, and what's turning out to be another banner year. In fact, year-to-date, Vans is already well above the $1.5 billion revenue mark as the big brand gets even greater traction as the global icon of creative expression in the world's youth culture.", "In the Americas, momentum continues with revenues up at a low-double digit rate, including a mid-teen increase in D2C and a high-single digit increase in wholesale. In a strong quarter with balanced growth, increasing product momentum, and consumer engagements, I'll start with product.", "Our footwear success continues to be broad-based with momentum across all of our footwear categories with particular callouts to Sk8-Hi and Old Skool as some of our iconic side stripe franchises which are seeing great consumer response. In fact, we've seen sellouts in a number of colors and styles of each. And with the colder, wetter weather on its way, our weatherized Mountain Edition footwear has seen incredibly strong growth in both the wholesale and retail channels.", "For the collector culture, we launched our new Kishimoto collection globally, featuring the unique symbolic printed designs that are trademarks of the London-based design team. Demand is off the charts, but we're never done.", "On Halloween in the States, in what will be its most technical collaboration yet, Vault by Vans and The North Face teamed up to create the Sk8-Hi Mountain Edition LX pack which has six pairs of limited edition shoes and one jacket, all designed to keep you warm during winter's harsh weather. The footwear uses Vans' reverse waffle lug outsole, The North Face's winter grip, Cosmo Comfort heat retention and water repellent uppers. To sum it up, these are take them anywhere, anytime, in any weather condition boots. And I think sneakerfreaker.com said it best when they called it the H1 Hummer of the Sk8-Hi fleet.", "On the consumer engagement front, the third annual Vans US Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach was a huge success. Not only did we garner a great turnout with nearly 7,000 people in one intense week and generate significant Vans business for local accounts and Vans stores. We did so in a sustainable way, fueling the majority of the event with bio-diesel and diverting 96% of waste. For an event of this size, this is a great brand building accomplishment and one that we're extremely proud of.", "Now to international.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "In Europe, Vans' revenue was up at mid-single digit rate driven by mid-teens growth in D2C and a slight increase in our wholesale business. We saw a lot of the same trends that Steve discussed with Sk8-Hi, Old Skool and the Kishimoto collections, all performing very well.", "Our new collaboration Vault WTAPS created a lot of energy around the brand for our aspirational consumer and was sold out within hours. We also recently launched weatherized Mountain Edition in footwear and apparel in the region and early results have been very strong.", "In Asia, Vans put up another really strong quarter with revenue up at high-teen rate, driven by more than 40% growth in D2C and a solid performance in wholesale. It's been a busy quarter in terms of brand engagement driven by our House of Vans Asia Tour which stops in Beijing and Seoul. With continued success in China, Vans is definitely in a friendly race with The North Face and Lee to become the largest VF brand in that country by the end of 2015.", "So with that, clearly very strong momentum in the Vans business globally, and we are on track to reach our mid-teen growth target for the full year.", "Now, let's turn to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Hey, before Timberland, a quick correction. I believe I said 7,000 people attended the U.S. Open of Surfing. I meant 700,000 people.", "Timberland had a strong quarter, with global revenues up 21%, with more than 25% growth in our wholesale business and a moderate increase in the D2C channel. In the Americas, the brand was up more than 40%, driven by over 50% growth in the wholesale business. Now while these numbers are clearly quite high, keep in mind that last year there was a significant order shift pulled from the third quarter into the second quarter as the brand came onto VF's business operating platform. Accordingly, this year's third quarter had a much easier comp. Normalizing for the timing shift, growth was right on track for the quarter and full year.", "Looking at our Tree business, we saw strong performance this quarter in both wholesale and D2C, driven predominantly by boots and hikers across both genders. In boots, it was exciting to see continued success with both classics and more casual styles. On the women's side, six-inch boots as well as the Teddy Fleece and Amston families were strong sellers. In men's, core boots in the Newmarket and Groveton families led the way.", "Tree apparel products were also outstanding performers during the quarter, driven by knits, wovens and outerwear. In September, we launched our new Made for the Modern Trail campaign, which redefines the outdoors and celebrates everyday adventure and exploration in the city, country and everywhere in-between. We kicked off the campaign with a number of events in New York, including a Timberland-UBER Promotion, which offered consumers free rides and surprise boots in a Timberland-branded jeep. This is one of UBER's most engaged promos ever, with more than 7,000 rides requested in just four hours.", "On the Pro side, our industrial business, we also saw continued momentum with strength in the Pro Boondock family of work boots. Beyond the appeal of the boot itself, success was driven by our expanded, When Your Feet Hurt Your Work Suffers campaign. So incredible growth for Timberland, and we're excited as we close out the rest of the year.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Timberland's European revenue was up at the high-single digit rate with comparable growth in both wholesale and D2C. The men's business, the SensorFlex, Stormbuck and Britton Hill product showed strong performance in footwear. On the women's side, the Glancy and Amston family of products both performed well.", "In terms of consumer engagement, we successfully kicked off the season with in-store events like the Vogue Fashion Night Out and continued with a 360-degree marketing campaign called Black Forest. This campaign gives Timberland's new lines and positioning great visibility in traditional and online media.", "Turning to Asia, revenue increased at the low-single digit rate, led by growth in D2C. On the apparel side, we saw strength across both our men's and women's offering with strong initial sell-through of our recently launched fall collection. And on the footwear side, growth was driven by our core boot styles, in particular new color offerings of our traditional six-inch boot, proving this iconic style excites consumers around the world.", "Overall, a consistently strong year-to-date performance from Timberland, and we remain on track to grow global revenue at the low-teen rate for the full year.", "Now, let's turn to Scott and Jeanswear.", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, Jeanswear Americas & Imagewear and South America", "Thanks, KH, and good morning, everyone. Our global Jeanswear business was up 4% on a currency neutral basis, with positive results for both Wrangler and Lee and growth in both wholesale and D2C channels. In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was up at a mid-single digit rate, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth, so very pleased with the progress we're making.", "Revenue for Wrangler in the Americas was up at a low-single digit rate. A few product highlights include our Advanced Comfort collection, which is performing well in the mid-tier market, and our Cool Vantage jeans, which once again exceeded expectations in our Western business, allowing us to expand offering into new doors at a number of our key partners. We also rolled out Wrangler Riggs to additional doors in the third quarter and remained very encouraged with the results from this collection.", "Over to Lee. We are pleased to see this business turn positive in the third quarter, with high-single digit revenue growth in the Americas. We've seen increasing momentum from our Modern Series platform for both men and women over the past few quarters and have expanded our women's denim offerings to additional department store doors. So definitely gaining momentum there.", "On the e-commerce side, we've worked with several online partners to bring updated looks to our brand pages for improved site experience and efforts that has contributed to strong sales growth. We feel great about our progress in the Jeanswear business, and we're excited about what we have in store for the fourth quarter.", "Now, back to KH.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "European revenues for Wrangler were up at the low-single digit rate, driven by growth in our e-commerce and D2C businesses. On the product side, we are seeing strong results from the clean modern look of the Metropolitan package and Larston slim tapered fit for men. We also launched a new Born Ready advertising campaign in September, which is expected to generate more than 250 million touch points through November.", "Lee continued its strong performance in Europe with a high-single digit increase representing the 10th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the brand in this region. New products like the boot-cut Juliette for women and Skinny Malone for men led to the strong results. At once, business continues to be strong as well, and Lee's full-price stores show the high-single digit comp in the quarter.", "In Asia, our Lee business was up at the high-single digit rate. Building on our successful Jade Fusion launch, we introduced our Magma Fusion product in September. Early results are quite positive.", "In closing, we are very pleased with the direction Jeanswear has taken over the past several quarters and are confident that we can achieve a mid-single digit increase in this coalition for the full year.", "And now to Imagewear.", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, Jeanswear Americas & Imagewear and South America", "Imagewear revenue was up slightly for the quarter with strong demand in our licensed sports group being offset by declines in our workwear business. In LSG, our Major League Baseball Cool Base Jersey has been a standout performer and we've seen strength in contending markets throughout the playoffs, particularly from long-suffering Mets, Blue Jays and Cubs fans, while our new on-field Take October graphic hoodies are garnering strong visibility in screen time.", "On the workwear side, while our Red Kap shop gear products saw strength, our Bulwark line remained challenged by slower oil exploration. Given the softer performance on the workwear side of the business, we're now expecting 2015 results to be flat with 2014.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Our Sportswear business was down slightly for the quarter reflecting a low-single digit decrease in the Nautica business, and a low-single digit increase in Kipling's U.S. business. Kipling's global business was up at a low-teen rate. As we work through ongoing challenges in D2C and at the department store channel, our efforts to elevate Nautica's business model has begun to pay dividends. However, based on the challenges in the current environment, we are adjusting our full-year expectations to low-single digit growth in the Sportswear coalition.", "Our Contemporary Brands coalition saw revenues decline 13% during the quarter, with equal wholesale and D2C weakness. We're disappointed in these results. While the softness of the overall Contemporary category and challenging retail environment has certainly contributed, we're working hard to assess our overall strategy for these businesses, focusing on product, consumer insights and channel strategies to determine ways to reinvigorate and strengthen these brands for the long-term.", "Given the year-to-date results, we are now expecting revenue for this coalition to be down at a high-single digit currency neutral rate in 2015.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a deeper dive into our financial results.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Steve. This has been a strong year for VF and despite what looks to be a somewhat softer retail environment, the performance for Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions is solid. They posted solid results in the quarter and are tracking quite well compared with their full-year and long-term growth targets. Representing more than 80% of VF's total revenue, these two coalitions combined are on pace to grow close to 10% in 2015. And our other coalitions demand has been particularly pressured by slower oil exploration and continued challenges in both direct-to- consumer and department stores, leaving those coalitions to report flat-to-down results.", "And as you'd expect, collectively, we continue to leverage our business model of diverse brands, geographies and channels along with our commitment to innovation and operational excellence, while delivering solid returns for our shareholders. And now, let's review our third quarter results.", "Currency neutral revenue increased 8%, which is in line with our full-year outlook. By channel, growth rates were balanced in both our wholesale and D2C businesses, up 8%. In fact, nearly every one of our brands' wholesale businesses were up in the quarter, including double-digit growth from The North Face, Timberland, Kipling, lucy, SmartWool, and Eastpak. Each region also had positive results including a low-single digit increase in Europe and a low-double digit increase in Asia, including more than 20% growth in China. And our non-U.S. Americas business was up at a high-teen rate.", "In D2C, similar to our wholesale results, nearly every brand was up during the quarter. A few callouts were Vans, Kipling and Napapijri, who had especially strong results. And regionally, we saw mid-teen increase in Europe and Asia and 40% currency neutral growth in our non-U.S. Americas business.", "Gross margin on a currency neutral basis was 48.9% in the third quarter, representing a 60-basis point improvement over the same period last year. Reported gross margin was down 40 basis points to 47.9%, as benefits from more favorable product costs and a shift in mix to higher-margin businesses were offset by foreign currency headwinds. Overall, changes in currency during the quarter accounted for 100 basis points of negative pressure, that's 30 basis points more than we expected just 90 days ago.", "And even though we did see improvements in the euro, which is about 40% of our total currency basket, this was more than offset by weakness in the Chinese RMB, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Considering that our third quarter has the highest percentage of international business, FX had a disproportionate impact in the period.", "Turning now to SG&A, our SG&A ratio was down 30 basis points to 30.1% compared to last year. This demonstrates the agility of our business model, offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation with operating leverage. Currency neutral operating income was up 14%, and operating margin was up 100 basis points over the same period last year to 19%. On a reported basis, operating income was up 2%, and operating margin declined 20 basis points to 17.8%. As previously mentioned, negative impacts from FX fell through to the bottom-line.", "Clicking down into profitability by coalition, we see reported Outdoor & Action Sports' operating income grew 3% and operating margin was 21.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points compared with last year's third quarter. This decline was entirely due to the impacts of changes in foreign currency, as about 40% of the coalition's revenue come from regions outside of the U.S. On a currency neutral basis, operating income was up 16%.", "Operating income in the Jeanswear business was up 1% in the third quarter, with operating margin up 30 basis points to 21.2%. Excluding the impact of currency, operating income was up 8%, nicely ahead of our revenue growth. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we're very pleased with this, our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth.", "Imagewear profitability was down 2% this quarter, as the workwear side of the business was impacted primarily by reduced demand in oil exploration. Operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 14.3%. This was due in part to unfavorable changes in foreign currency. Without the impact of that currency, operating income rose 2%.", "In Sportswear, even with a slight decrease in revenue, our operating margin improved 20 basis points to 14.3%. And while our Sportswear business remains pressured by softness in department stores and D2C, the strategic shift towards higher-quality sales is showing positive financial returns. And finally, our Contemporary Brands' business saw a significant decrease in revenue and profitability in the third quarter.", "Moving to the bottom-line, EPS grew at a healthy 14% on a currency neutral basis, placing our year-to-date results right at 15%, which is consistent with our outlook target for the full year. On a reported basis, EPS was down 1% due to foreign currency headwinds.", "Turning now to some balance sheet details, our inventories were up 12% at the end of the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. And since I can already hear your question, how could 12% be in line with an expected low-single digit growth rate in the fourth quarter? Well, let me put some context around that.", "First, this year's order book, especially for all our colder weather products, shifted much more heavily into the first few weeks of October compared with a year ago. This causes us to build inventory receipts more aggressively at the end of Q3 to meet consumers' early October request dates. And second, with 147 more doors in our D2C business this year, there is a bit of distortion in the year-over-year D2C inventory comparisons. We've opened these stores earlier this year in order to maximize retail sales in the key fourth quarter period.", "So the takeaway is clear, we are not concerned about Q3 inventory levels. In fact, our attention to inventory management is as focused and well-informed as it's ever been, and we expect year-end levels to be back in line with revenue growth. And of course, we're pleased to report that our board of directors approved a new quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, which is $0.05 or 16% over the prior rate. This represents the 43rd consecutive year in which we've increased our dividend, a meaningful example of the commitment to our shareholders that demonstrates confidence in the future. Given the increase in the quarterly rate, this takes our 2015 dividend to $1.33, a 20% increase over the prior year.", "Now, let's look ahead to our full-year expectations, beginning with the top-line. For context, remember that this year's fourth quarter is up against last year's 53rd week, which added about 300 basis points to the top-line in that quarter. Accordingly, we see revenue growth at a low-single digit reported rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year, with a bit more cautious outlook given the current environment, we expect currency neutral revenue to be up 7.5%. On a reported basis, we expect to approach 3% growth.", "By coalition on a currency neutral basis, we expect Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions, which represent the vast majority of our total revenue and profit, to remain strong. There is no change to our outlook for low-double digit and mid-single digit growth respectively for these coalitions.", "And for the reasons previously outlined in this call, we now expect Imagewear revenue to be flat compared with the last year versus our previous outlook of mid-single digit growth. In our Sportswear coalition, we're now expecting low-single digit growth versus our previous expectation for mid-single digit growth, and revenue for our Contemporary Brands' business is now expected to be down in the high-single digit range.", "We continue to expect our currency neutral gross margin for 2015 to be about 49.5%, reflecting a 70-basis point increase over 2014 and at our 17x17 target level two years early. This year's expansion is due to the continued mix shift towards higher-margin businesses and favorable product costs in 2015, two trends that we expect to continue. Remember, VF's fourth quarter is expected to generate the strongest margin and profit comparisons, given our higher proportion of D2C in Outdoor & Action Sports, coupled with favorable product costs. On a reported basis, given the additional FX pressure, we expect the reported gross margin to be about flat with 2014.", "Moving now to the bottom-line, there is no change to our expectation that currency neutral earnings per share will increase 15% to last year's adjusted EPS of $3.08. On a reported basis, we're letting the previously described negative impact from foreign currency, about $0.04, flow through to the bottom-line. This revises our full-year EPS to $3.18, representing approximately 3% growth over last year's adjusted EPS. Keep in mind the 53rd week added about 400 basis points of EPS growth net of currency in the fourth quarter last year.", "So in closing, despite a choppy environment, our model is proving once again to be successful.", "Now, I'll turn it over to the operator and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bob.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "I guess the first question I have is, is I think there was just some commentary around what appears to be more of a tepid retail environment. So I guess the questions that I have are around: if you could elaborate a little bit more sort of what you're seeing, even up through this morning in terms of the retail environment and different channels? And I guess within your own D2C business, can you just talk a little bit about like about whether the revised outlook on some of this is on outlet stores versus full-price stores and the various nameplates, and what you've seen over the last several months?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Bob. It's Eric. I guess you know who this is. I'll take that question. When we came out in July and talked about the balance of the year, we said that we thought that the third quarter would resemble the second quarter in terms of revenue growth rate, which implied about 10% growth in the quarter. And obviously we came in at 8%. Now, while 8% is a good number, right in line with our long-range plans, it is a little bit softer than we thought, and we saw a slowdown in consumer traffic pretty much across the board, in our stores and in our customers, in our retail customers' stores.", "Given what we saw in the quarter, we've elected to take a more cautious view on the year, and we've reduced our full-year revenue guidance to 7.5%. Even having said that, though, we do expect our top five brands to have a 10% increase, and we still are holding our 15% EPS growth. The shape of it, the third quarter started off really slow. It did gather some steam as it rolled into September. And September was clearly the most engaged month in terms of consumer engagement for us. Regarding our brands, it did affect all of our brands.", "Having said that, I'll note that most of our D2C businesses in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition those brands have the most stores and the biggest volume. And while they were affected, nobody is immune to this, they are holding their full-year revenue forecast and earnings forecasts for those businesses. So those businesses remain strong. It did affect our Sportswear and Contemporary businesses more. I'm trying to think of what I left out.", "Outlet versus full-price? I don't know. I can't answer that. I'm not aware of any big difference in that. The people in the room are giving me hand signals that say it wasn't more in one than the other.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "All right. And, Eric, I just have two other questions. I think first is, can you comment on, you guys have a lot of exposure to Walmart, with especially the Jeanswear business. Could you just comment a little bit about any update in the relationship there in sort of a lot of the business initiatives that they're undertaking and how you are planning that to impact your business, whether for this quarter or, over the next year or so?", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, Jeanswear Americas & Imagewear and South America", "Good morning, Bob, this is Scott, how are you?", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Good, Scott.", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, Jeanswear Americas & Imagewear and South America", "I'll make a few quick comments. First of all, we don't comment on specific accounts. But what I am going to tell you is that we've had a multi-decade really strong partnership with Walmart, and that's going to continue in the future. I will tell you that our mass business, which Walmart is part of our mass business, was up in the quarter, and we're real confident about the Jeanswear plans going forward and feel good about our business in that category in the future.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Michael.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Let me start on the gross margins because that's been a focus for the sector here. The inventories are a little high, I think Scott talked about that a little bit. And then if we just look at some of the detail through payables and inventory metrics, they looked a little higher than they've been. But much more importantly, there was a lot of inventory out there from the retailers who are reporting. And as we start off running season, there is some weakness in gross margin across the space. So can you just help us get a little bit more confidence in the drivers that you see in the gross margins in the fourth quarter, maybe a bit of the buildup there?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. Sure, Michael. So I guess you've probably done the math, you've looked, you see what we're implying in the fourth quarter. And our fourth quarter margins we expect to be really strong for a couple of reasons. One is it's our big Outdoor & Action Sports and retail quarter. We talked about the fact it relates back to that inventory discussion. We have more stores open versus a year ago. Those non-comp doors are going to be really paying off in the fourth quarter. And also our e-com business, which continues to gain strength, is particularly strong in the fourth quarter.", "So we're going to see that mix come roaring back in the fourth quarter, and it's going to be a big driver of gross margin. Also, we'll see a little moderation on the FX side because remember, this is our biggest international quarter in the third quarter. So as we get into the fourth quarter and also a comp and a little bit easier FX versus last year, that's going to moderate a little bit as we move into the next quarter.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve, would you comment for Michael on \u2013 because Michael, we obviously anticipate some of these questions, so we've done some looking into the status of our inventory with our retail customers. Steve, do you want to comment on how that looks.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I mean, at this point, our inventory levels, within our key customers across all of the businesses and channels, we don't see anything that would give us concern, that we're sitting on higher than needed inventories, to service the business.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "We know that there is excess inventory out there in the retail channel, but it's not in our brands.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I remember a year ago you shut down some factories when that was the case and you've been on top of that in the past. Maybe I can just dig in a little bit more on, I know of Bob asked about D2C, but it seems like growth about 8%, it looks like the stores, store count growth was a bit higher. It seems to imply that comp sales were lower in the third quarter. And that could've been a number of things. But can you talk about the fourth quarter buildup there and whether, it's based on an expectation that the comp sales accelerate?", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So the quarter, as we look into fourth quarter, I guess the question is do we see a change in our comp forecast? And I think it's fair to say that we will see a slight moderation, probably more like a mid-single digit comp for the quarter across our retail platform. But I would tell you, I think we have really good confidence as we come through. Our D2C business was strong for the quarter in all the different formats that we have, and to Scott's point, our powerful e-commerce model and our connection with our consumers digitally really gives us confidence that we've got the right tools and the right connections to consumers to drive that traffic and ultimately the conversion.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And I'll add to that Michael, that while our \u2013 we are seeing some pressure on our comps, we still are \u2013 we had positive comps in the quarter. We expect positive comps for the year.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The interesting thing, and Scott has kind of alluded to in his comments, is our wholesale business is really hot right now. We had double-digit wholesale growth domestically, and in Asia, and in the non-Americas region, all reported double-digit wholesale growth. And you know, that's helping us get through this a whole lot, so.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Good morning, guys. So I had two questions. First, on FX, you had \u2013 on foreign currency, you had given some color that the euro comprises, I think 40% of the mix. Could you maybe give, I don't know if you've done this in the past, but could you maybe give some color on the remaining large currencies and some sense of what percent of the mix those represent?", "And then my second question was regarding D2C, kind of a follow-up to prior. Can you just remind us what you \u2013 the remainder of the shifts that you guys expect from wholesale to D2C? That's obviously been a big theme. Just a reminder of how much more that still has to go? And what the potential gross, a more positive gross margin impact of that would be? Thanks.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Dave. This is Scott. I will take the first part of that question. So you hit it exactly right. We've said that while the euro is our largest single exposure, it's less than half, actually about 40% of the total basket that we're against. And when you take the Chinese RMB, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, as well as the pound sterling, those collectively are about 50% of our exposure, just to put some perspective on it, right?", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Now, it's really \u2013 and that movement in those non-euro currencies has really been the big driver over the last 90 days, as we look at the impact both in the third quarter and for the full year.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And, Dave, I'll take the mix question. For the third quarter, D2C was 22% of our business. It is normally higher that on an annual basis, but as you know, that all is going to happen in this quarter. It'll be a much bigger part of our mix. The D2C as a percentage of our total revenue has grown every year the last couple of years. We expect that to continue 100 basis points to 200 basis points a year. A lot of that's \u2013 some of that's driven by new stores. We are still under-penetrated around the world. A bunch of it's driven by D2C \u2013 I'm sorry, by e-commerce.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And all of those \u2013 all that favors our margins.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I wanted to follow up a little bit on margin drivers from currency and cost \u2013 and input costs. You've had a number of puts and takes, and given some of your lead times and hedges, can you help us understand over the next four quarters, assuming that spot rates stay where they are, how we should think about the balance of impact to your gross margins from the flow-through of currency moves versus things like lower input costs from cotton and the other inputs?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Lindsay. Yeah, so first of all in the currency, for the year now, we see about 70 basis points in negative currency. And really, it's the things that I just spoke about on the previous question, relative to the non-euro currencies. And that's flowing through against the year. And the other thing, you asked about input costs. And we've been really consistent all year along about what to expect in terms of input costs. Remember, it was a little bit against us in the first half of the year. It turned \u2013 it starts to be favorable in the third quarter, and we really see that coming home in the fourth quarter. So for the full year, it's 20 basis points to 30 basis points of cost that we see coming through on the positive side. And obviously, that's a trend which should continue into the next year.", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then just maybe bigger picture. As we think about some of the choppy industry dynamics that you're talking about, some of the issues with respect to traffic and your customers that might be more structural versus cyclical, how are you guys thinking about managing the part of your business where you do have some pretty direct exposure there, whether it's outside of Outdoor & Action and specific to wholesale? And whether that's something we should think about as a headwind to longer-term growth?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The \u2013 are you asking if we intend to continue investing in our direct-to-consumer strategy?", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No, I'm asking how you're going to play defense where your \u2013 in the parts of your portfolio where you have pretty direct exposure to some of the most challenging industry trends, whether that's...", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "...department stores and fashion?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well, Lindsay, the first comment I'll make is \u2013 and you know us, so you know we've been investing for years in our innovation strategy, have doubled down on that investment in the last 12 months of creating product innovation centers. And the reality is if you look at our wholesale business, I mentioned on another question that we had double-digit growth in our wholesale business and our inventories at retail are in good shape. That tells you that for us to be growing 8% in quarters like this shows you that we have the right brands and the right products behind those brands. And it is more difficult out there and clearly the industry isn't growing at 8%, but we are and that tells you that we've got \u2013 our investments in innovation and in communication with our consumers, we're much better at communicating in our stores. I don't know if you've seen the Never Stop TV campaign from The North Face, but it's a much more emotional way of communicating that brand than we've ever had.", "Lindsay Beth Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on China. A few quarters ago, it was called out that you had about 2,500 doors in China versus some of your peers at 5,000. Can you remind us how big China is today? And I would presume there is an upside to the $1 billion goal you called out for 2017. Any color on how each brand is in China would be great?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Laurent, this is Karl Heinz. Try to answer your question. China is about $600 million. It's growing $600 million and bigger. It's growing as we had planned. We just quoted in this quarter, we are up mid-teens. It is true, the number of doors you mentioned. We have \u2013 we operate with four brands primarily, you know the four big brands. And in total, we sum up to 2,500 doors. We have competitors with less brands have much, much, much higher number of doors, so we see China as a great opportunity going forward. I always say China is a marathon and while we might have bumps in the short-term, which we are not seeing at the moment, we think that market is a great opportunity for us.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great. And then automation is a big theme going forward. NIKE partnered with Flextronics last week and adidas with Manz, and then Under Armour talked about Project Glory yesterday. You guys are at the forefront of manufacturing. How are you thinking about the supply chain revolution? What are the near-term and long-term implications, as well as the gross margin and speed-to-market opportunities?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Our innovation strategy captures advanced manufacturing as one of those key areas that we're looking at both in our denim innovation center and our technical apparel, as well as footwear. Supply chain is obviously one of our greatest strengths and our supply chain team is directly involved and have people sitting within our innovation centers helping our teams think not just about how we design products, the materials that go into the products, but thinking long-term how we make them. How do we make them more efficiently, how might we make them to give ourselves a real differentiating look to the consumer in the marketplace, but also to your point, where do we make things and how do we positively impact our speed-to-market and build on some of the powerful platforms we have, such as Vans and Timberland in this area of customization.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you, and congrats.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Kate.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "My question is just on SG&A spend during the quarter. You've always talked about how you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to your spend. But I think this rate of growth was one of the lowest in a couple of years. Is there any spending that's being shifted into Q4? And can you walk us through maybe some of the drivers of the growth during the quarter?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Kate. Scott here. I'll take that question. First of all, let me tell you what we're not doing. We're not reducing any spending in strategic priorities and that means demand creation, that means product creation, that means innovation. These strategic priorities always get the first bite of the Apple, and this is no exception to that. But as we've seen softer environment, we're good cost managers, and we look for leverage in those other, call it, the leverageable side of our platform, and we see that in the third quarter, and we'll see that going forward into the fourth quarter.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you. And then just my second question is a longer-term outlook question, but I think we continue to hear very positive things from you about Kipling and JanSport and Napapijri. And lucy appears to be doing well in the sporting goods channel. When can these become more meaningful, already meaningful, but more meaningful brands, and will you be flexing that more significantly in the next year or so?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's a great question. As soon as possible would be my preferred answer to that. But you watched us build brands like The North Face and Vans, which were the size that Kipling is now. And we have a very deliberate, thoughtful approach to building brands. We're not in a race to build them too quickly, because that's possible to do. We like to keep our brands in desire and special, and we are building the brands that you just talked about very methodically right now.", "A great example is lucy, where when we bought the business it was nothing but a D2C business. And that was exclusively a D2C business. And we've expanded that into a wholesale business, and that is working. And it's things like Kipling, which we're taking around the world right now with great success. Next year is the year of the monkey in China, and you will be hearing from Kipling in that region of the world in particular.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. So can you talk a little bit more to Vans? I know there's some noise lapping some shipment timings and things like that. But any real change in demand that you're seeing in any region? Or any changes on the competitive landscape with Vans?", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I'll start, and then Karl Heinz can build in. I would tell you that there are absolutely no concerns with our Vans business. In fact, their performance you saw this quarter was exactly in line with our plans. The Vans business is operating at an impressive level. Their understanding of their consumer, not just here in the U.S. but across the globe, really informs, you know, how they think about their product creation platform and how they connect with their consumer, especially digitally.", "I would let Karl Heinz talk about the international aspect, but on the U.S. side a very, very strong, you know, rich, rich product platforms entering the marketplace, with really good connections to the consumer.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Yeah, maybe starting with Europe. You know, I completely agree what Steve said. There's a lot of good stories happening on their product side. Probably I refer to the quarter in Europe, which was a little bit softer than we had in the past. This is absolutely phasing which impacted us from a timing perspective, but it will normalize in Q4. And for the full year, we are right in line with our expectations.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, let me \u2013 this is Scott, let me just add one other data point on that. Year-to-date, we're running about 16% which is right in line with our full-year guidance. So if you look at the shifting between quarters, when you normalize for that, we're really right on track.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just as a follow-up. So larger picture, as we think about next year, and I know you're not providing guidance, but what's the best rule of thumb to think about foreign exchange exposure, if rates were to remain where they're at today? And then, Eric, just are there any drivers of your 15% constant currency earnings this year that don't continue into next year?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, this is Scott again. I'll take the first part of that. If you look at where our currency rates are today, and obviously we would say that's going to be a headwind, but in terms of specific guidance or rule of thumb, we're not going to give that, as you know, for 2016 at this point. But I would just encourage you to not isolate on one factor. Because as I mentioned earlier, we've got headwinds from currency based on what we see today. On the other hand, commodities are going in our favor. And we've shown over time that we're able to have pricing power, and that formula really has allowed us to maintain our margins over time and I see no reason why that won't continue in the future.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And looking forward in terms of the trend, the only comment I'll make is how methodical and deliberate we are. We have a reputation for being pretty good at execution. And just looking at the last quarter, our total business was up 8%. And domestically, we were up 8%. And internationally, we were up 9%. And our direct-to-consumer business was up 8%. And that's our long-term model, to deliver that 8% growth a year. And we are executing against that and expect to execute against it in the future.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Best of luck.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Chris Svezia from Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I just have a \u2013 actually just one, maybe, Karl, for you. Just maybe dive a little bit into the European business on the wholesale side. I think you touched on in response to the last question about just Vans seem to be an issue with regard to timing, but maybe you can add just some color about what's going on in the marketplace? And then more specifically about North Face just being kind of flat in the quarter. Is that also a timing issue? Or is there just any thoughts in and around the European piece of business on Outdoor & Action Sports? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Yeah, we don't see big changes going on in Europe. You know, most of our brands, actually are growing. North Face you mentioned, North Face was up low-single digits. So the brand is doing well. From a geography point of view, we see pretty strong performances of our brands in the Southern Hemisphere, Europe, Italy, Spain are doing really well. But also U.K., which is a very important market for us, we are up in a very meaningful way, double-digit. And the big German countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, very solid performance. So I would say the brands are doing well, especially the big brands, but also Napa was touched before, Napa, Kipling. We have a great portfolio story there going on.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "So just to go back on that for one second, I just want you to talk about flat wholesale for North Face in the quarter. That was in line with your plan? Do you expect that to accelerate in the fourth quarter? Is that timing? Or I'm just curious about the wholesale piece on Europe with regard to North Face?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Yeah, no. Specifically, it was a little bit timing, right? We have \u2013 we're pleased with the performance of The North Face. We had in the past it was a little bit softer, but it started to grow again nicely this year. The brand is really doing well, what we hear from our consumers.", "Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Thank you very much. All the best.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. Eric, I guess for you, if you could maybe just touch a little bit on the M&A environment? I know you guys have talked in the past about seeing opportunities but just maybe not seeing willing sellers. So is that still the theme that you're seeing? Are there any new opportunities emerging? That would be my first question. Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, Erinn, I guess fortunately and unfortunately nothing has changed. We are very focused on certain sectors to acquire in those sectors, and we're focused on certain companies within those sectors. And we are working those opportunities. So that's the good news, is there is no change in our strategy. The bad news side of it is we didn't make any progress last quarter or we didn't get anything done, but we are making progress on some things. Eventually something will happen. We just don't know when that will be.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. And any change in terms of the multiples that you're seeing out there? Just as things that particularly domestically have taken a little bit of a softer patch in the last quarter or so?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, not really.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. And then, I guess, secondly on China, just following up on kind of more near-term trends, a lot of chatter has come out of China, just with Golden Week being a little bit softer the month of October. And could you maybe just parse out a little bit more on kind of what you're seeing a little bit more real-time? And then maybe what you're seeing in jeans versus the outdoor channel in China in particular? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "There were some noise in the line, but I think you're asking about China, right? What we see in China, especially on jeans and outdoor. I think we said it in the script, Lee is doing really well in China, had been a big consistent success story for long time. And we are pleased that we are the leader in China, which is a really, really good news.", "Outdoor, I think we have two by brands, as you know, The North Face and Vans. I think Vans, the numbers we gave you, they comment for itself. It's really strong. Vans is doing extremely well in China, and we are together with The North Face is in a race, as I said in my script, it's becoming with The North Face simply the largest brand.", "Outdoor was up \u2013 North Face was up also very nicely in China this quarter. And we had in the past a few issues with inventory, but that seems to be cleared at the moment. So again, I always, even if I'm repetitive, China is a great opportunity for us long-term.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. And I may have broken up just on the line, but I guess my initial question was just really on the month of October there has been a tremendous amount of concern on kind of Golden Week and traffic trends. Did you see any step function change around that period? Or has it just been kind of consistent strength that you referenced in the script?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. We haven't seen any change.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Omar.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. On the China currency hit, do you see \u2013 I know it's a headwind on the top-line, do you see an opportunity on the flip side in your supply chain in China and other Southeast Asian sourcing markets to use the lower currency to maybe pass through lower cost to the consumer. Is that one of the potential offsets there?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, great question, and absolutely, yes. Obviously, it takes a while for that to work through the system but yeah, we should see that benefit. We're expecting to see that longer-term.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "And additionally, have you started to think about TPP and what that could mean and how your supply chain is set up, how that could play out if it goes through?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yeah. Of course, we're watching it daily probably. You know the situation, right? There is an agreement in principle that's yet to be ratified by all the countries that are participating and probably most importantly, the devil is in the details here in terms of the administrative rulings which we have yet to see. Having said that, we know it's going to be a good thing for VF. It's a positive development. We're just not sure exactly what and when that's going, what that's going to be and when we're going to see that.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And the last question, on the pricing power, have you started in some of the markets where the strong dollar has caused the costs side of the equation to go higher relative to the currency of the market? Have you started to test price increases at all in those places? Or is that something and should we think about that going into next year as perhaps that FX headwind lingers?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation and Group President, International", "Omar, KH here. Maybe I handle this question because we are affected. The answer is yes. We have done this. We started with spring. We plan to do it in fall. Now, we do it in two ways, right? The good news is a large part of our line is new products, so we had to position them differently, so that we can cover the difference. The second one is, you know, price increases, which we do on some iconic products which we have done and we are doing. It's not new, though, for us, the situation, right? I mean, this is part our job and we do it. We have done it and we will do it in the future?", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jim.", "Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple of questions for you guys. You've talked about D2C at the corporate level. Can we get more brand specific there? I know that Vans and Timberland have the largest retail fleets. Are you seeing softness in the D2C businesses from those brands?", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. I'll take that, Jim. We really are, we're seeing, you know, some softness across all of our brands. Our biggest brands are not immune, but they're not impacted to the degree that we saw in our Sportswear and CBC businesses. And I would tell you that North Face and Vans, were right in line with our expectations in the quarter. Timberland, though good was just a little bit off, and we really attribute that to the warmer autumn weather when we look at the styles that we're selling and really they're weather-related activity component.", "Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks for that, Steve. And then, Eric, I have a question I think that's probably most appropriate for you. So each year, Sportswear and Contemporary seem to fall short of plan, and objectives for margin improvement get pushed out. Implicitly, they're shrinking as a percent of the mix, but how do you think about these businesses and how they fit in the portfolio?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "There are two businesses that are in different situations right now. The Sportswear business is working on improving their business model, moving it more towards the higher-priced better product that will be more full-price oriented. So what we're seeing in them this year is actually where they have some softness in the top-line growth rates. Part of that is by design as they change their mix of customers and products, and that was supposed to result in improved operating margin, and it has. So that is, while it's a little off of its growth rate, its profitability is right where we wanted it to be. And that's part of the changes we're making in that business.", "The Contemporary business, as Steve said, I think Steve said that it was we're disappointed in those results as is the whole Contemporary team. And we're working with that team right now to improve the financial results of that coalition. It's not where it needs to be and we need to fix it. So that's on us. Fortunately, I guess, it's a small piece of our company, a very small piece of our company. But it is a drag on us right now. We owe it to our shareholders to fix it.", "Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then within the Sportswear business when you talk about repositioning, is that the Nautica brand you're referring to? Because...", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Yes it is.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. And Jim, let me add a little bit to that. You might remember something we said about Timberland where we talked about slowing down to speed up. And you see that going on with Nautica. And we've talked in the last couple of calls about the consumer work and strategy work we're doing with the team there, and the great work that they're doing to inform the future. Starting first with product, and Eric mentioned, the good, better, best. Assortment, really thinking about segmentation. What we've seen to-date is a really nice improvement in sell-through. We know that in almost all cases, we're outperforming our competitors on those floors, and we're seeing a nice uptick in AURs year-over-year.", "And to Eric's point, that's showing up in our P&L, but it's also showing up in our dealers' P&Ls. We're being very, very thoughtful around what and when we're putting \u2013 what, when and where we are putting our inventory on the floor. And that's really resulting in a much more positive business result, though growing slower, really much more profitable.", "Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sam Poser with Sterne Agree.", "Ben Shamsian - Sterne Agee", "Hi. Good morning, it's Ben Shamsian for Sam. Thanks for taking my call. You talked about growing despite the soft consumer environment. For your largest brands, can you talk about the market share game you're seeing, who are the players you're taking from, or the categories that you're taking? So if you can just parse that out a little bit more, that would be helpful.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it would be really hard for us to comment on share. It's not a number that I have sitting here in front of me. I would tell you that we know, we are growing right in line with our plans. Our retail partners continue to be very positive about our relationship and continue to grow, they're open to buy. That might imply growing our share. But I think where we also focus is, and I think you kind of see it in The North Face ad campaign this year, we're really looking to grow the market that our brands play in. And as we do that, not necessarily a measure of share, it's just how big is the pie that we have to play in, and we outwork our competitors to take our fair share.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "The only thing I'll add to that, because we don't have the share numbers here, it's hard to define exactly who Timberland competes against, is it in apparel, was it footwear or by country? But if you look at those three big brands, The North Face, Vans, and Timberland, The North Face outlook for the year is a low-double digit growth, Timberland is low-teen and Vans is mid-teen. And I will tell you, their sectors are not growing at that rate. So that implies we're taking share.", "Ben Shamsian - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. I appreciate you letting me squeeze in here. And you've talked a lot about the softness in the retail environment right now, and yet your numbers were very good in your big brands in the third quarter. Can you just remind us of your ability to divert if you have any, divert any inventory across your regions should some of those sell-through patterns not materialize as expected?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Across geographic regions is not something we do. So our inventory tends to end up in a country, in the United States, and doesn't go outside the country. In Europe, we look at more of as one market, so we can do that there. And our Asian inventory is seen as Asia-Pacific inventory. We can move it around, but we have some, there's some another process in there, because we'll have Korean hang tags on one product and those would need to be changed, but some of that we can do.", "Steven E. Rendle - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Just to maybe add one other factor. Our supply chain is world-class, and, you know, a real advantage here. Because while we don't divert products while they're are already in country, as we see demand changing on a global basis and we have global lines, we can redirect where that product goes to match better with demand. So really, that's, rather than shipping it twice, really that's the way that we adjust our inventories and keep things in balance.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "And would you rather take inventory from your wholesale partners back rather than have any sort of markdowns or clearance activity at wholesale, should some of these warmer trends persist in to the key selling months?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. There is not one answer to that, right? I mean, that's going to be a case-by-case basis. In general, we don't have much of either, returns or markdowns. So we want to keep it that way.", "Camilo R. Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. Best of luck, guys.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thanks, Tracy. Not a long closing remark. Thank you for your interest in our company and for your questions, and time and attention this morning. And as we said, we did see a slight slowdown from our Q2 trend in the third quarter. I think that our results and our outlook demonstrates that we have the brands, the products and the platforms to win in this environment, and that's what we expect to do and we'll tell you how the holiday season was in February. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the VF Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of IR. Please go ahead.", "Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's Fourth Quarter 2015 Results.", "I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "I'd also like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will predominantly be in currency-neutral terms. By our definition, which is detailed in our press release issued at 6:55 AM Eastern this morning, currency-neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions.", "You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance to U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates.", "We've chosen these currency-neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.", "Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; our CFO, Scott Roe; and VF Executives, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter.", "Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks.", "Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016.", "2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year called for currency-neutral revenue growth of 8% and earnings growth of 12%, and through the first nine months we tracked ahead of that goal with top line growth of 9% and earnings up 15%.", "Then, during our call in October we spoke about a more cautious approach to the balance of the year, including a softer consumer environment, and appropriately we adjusted our outlook for the year.", "Our fundamental assumptions proved to be accurate. However, the consumer softness accelerated and was compounded by the warmest fourth quarter on record. As the quarter developed, we took immediate action to leverage the many strengths of our business model and pulled many operational levers to minimize the impact, manage the inventories and maintain brand integrity during a difficult retail period.", "Our fourth quarter results did not materialize as we originally planned. However, our responsiveness and operational agility allowed us to finish out the year in a way that's consistent with our 2017 goals.", "Currency-neutral revenue was up 6% and EPS was up 12%. And when you normalize for the 53rd week over the past two years, both 2015 and 2014 averaged 7% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. So while we were a point shy on the top line, we were right on for the bottom line against our 2017 plans for these two years.", "As we close out 2015, I have a renewed sense of resolve and respect for how nimble and capable our company really is and I have complete confidence in our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns.", "As consumers' priorities continue to change, we're right there with them, strategically analyzing their shopping behavior, their preferences and the way they interact with our brands. Whether that's in our stores or online or through our wholesale partners, they're demanding more from the products they buy; more engagement and more authenticity from the brands they choose to develop relationships with and the ability to show up whenever and however they choose to shop. I'm confident that VF is uniquely positioned to win in this environment.", "So, what's in store for 2016? We expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging mostly in the first half as last year's overhang works through the system before conditions normalize in our most meaningful quarters of the year. Throughout 2016, we will seize the opportunity to stay on the offense and we will remain focused on the things that keep us healthy in 2016 and beyond, such as: we're making outsized investments in product innovation to drive newness and excitement into the marketplace, we're building even stronger relationships with our consumers, we're strengthening our operational capabilities and delivering appropriate financial performance while positioning VF for sustainable profitable growth over the long term.", "Our team will go deeper into the details in a moment, but translating all of that into our 2016 financial outlook, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth and 11% EPS growth. Given our incomplete visibility into the year, especially around our cold weather-related products, we believe this is a sensible reflection on the current and going-forward environment.", "As I think more about our future, I think about VF's strengths and how they've enabled us to develop a respected track record of success with brands that we've added to our portfolio. Strategically, we've described ourselves as active portfolio managers. While I can't be specific, I can tell you that in 2016 we're taking an especially focused and proactive look towards the composition of our portfolio to ensure that we are optimally positioned to maximize growth and returns to our shareholders.", "We are actively exploring the segments of the business we want to expand our portfolio in and we're exploring where we might want less exposure. We will certainly talk more about this in the future and keep you posted as those plans unfold.", "As you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders. In 2016, we'll continue this commitment because a softer environment shouldn't mean shareholders have to sit on the sidelines. We've got a healthy increase in our share buyback to about $1 billion, and with our dividend payout we expect to return $1.5 billion in total this year.", "Now, allow me to pre-answer one of your almost certain questions. With respect to potential portfolio composition, share buyback is an and conversation, not an or conversation, meaning there's no impact to our ability to pursue acquisitions that are right for VF.", "In closing, our business model remains solid and intact. Nothing is fundamentally different with our story. We're committed to our strategy and it's working. VF is well-equipped to navigate through these near-term challenges, and our strength and discipline lead us to maintain our commitment to returning shareholder value. I am extremely proud of the work our team is doing and I'm excited about what lies ahead.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition of brand results, and then over to Scott Roe to review our financial performance. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thanks, Eric. Outdoor & Action Sports' currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter, with a mid-single digit increase in D2C offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we were up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014, so normalizing for that over both periods the coalition was up 5% in the quarter. Clearly contributing to these results was the warmest fourth quarter on record, yet I'm proud to say that we came through relatively strong given the challenges.", "Taking a look at VF's three largest brands, fourth quarter revenue for The North Face was down 2%, with low-single digit growth in D2C offset by a mid-single digit decline in wholesale. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, revenue in the quarter was up 1% over last year.", "Revenue in the Americas region was down at a low-single digit rate, a result directly related to warm weather. And while heavier outerwear styles did not perform to expectations, we did see success with shells and midweight styles, validating our strategy to provide more adaptable, multi-season product.", "ThermoBall is a great example of this and a franchise that continued its strong growth. ThermoBall is the best-selling outerwear franchise in the U.S. market across all brands over the past two years. This was bolstered by a new product-specific ad campaign launched in November.", "We also relaunched our pinnacle Summit Series Collection globally, offering best mountaineering product and pushing the limits of product innovation and technology.", "Beyond outerwear, we saw great performance in our running and training apparel driven by Mountain Athletics growing more than 40%. Our continued efforts to connect even more deeply with consumers through inspired exploration, including physical, emotional and creative pursuits, has never been more strategic.", "Our Never Stop Exploring brand campaign, which we launched in Q4, was our first expansive view of exploration and our first truly global brand effort. And with over 1 billion impressions, we're really pleased with the results and confident it connected with and inspired adventurers everywhere.", "As we look ahead, The North Face will continue to encourage consumers to explore, train and live, and we have a great pipeline of innovative product that will help them do just that.", "Now to Karl Heinz.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The North Face European business was down at a mid-single digit rate, with low-teen D2C growth being offset by a decline in the wholesale business. We saw strength in our ThermoBall and Mountain Athletics collection during the quarter as well as our Ultra footwear line.", "We also launched a new store concept on Regent Street in London, which allows athletes to train together in weekly sessions. We have seen great response so far.", "For the full year, The North Face in Europe grew faster than the overall outdoor apparel market. It was challenged by unseasonably warm weather in November and December, and even so our own DTC business grew 25%.", "Across the year, we put a lot of focus on elevating our brand position in the market by carefully managing inventories. We also made meaningful steps in terms of segmenting the European marketplace from a merchandising perspective. We feel well-positioned for accelerated growth in 2016.", "In Asia, fourth quarter revenue increased at a low-single digit rate driven by slight growth in D2C and a relatively flat wholesale business. During the quarter, we launched the FuseForm product for the first time, with great response. We also hosted the TNF Outdoor Festival in Shanghai Century Park, which had more than 4,000 visitors during the course of the weekend.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "To wrap up The North Face, revenues for the year were up 5% globally in 2015 to $2.3 billion, or up 6% excluding FX and the 53rd week. And while we're off our long-term growth target this year, our fourth quarter performance does give me confidence that this brand is built to perform in many environments, is strong and opportunistically has many competitive advantages in play.", "Given the current environment, as we look at 2016 we see the year ahead as an opportunity to evolve and amplify The North Face brand both on a strategic and tactical level. We've realigned our global category management model to better focus on individual consumer usage occasions. This enabled us to deliver even stronger product and brand experiences to connect and inspire new and existing consumers in ways never done before.", "For the full year, we expect The North Face to grow revenue at a mid-single digit rate, so similar to 2015. This early outlook based on fourth quarter results and our fall selling process is an accurate reflection of what we see ahead.", "Turning to Vans. Global revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter with a low-double digit increase in D2C and a low-single digit increase in the wholesale business. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, the fourth quarter was up 13%. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was up in a mid-single digit rate, again, impacted by the 53rd week, with double-digit D2C growth and a slight decline in wholesale.", "On the product front, we continue to see success with our strategic move toward providing a complete four season offering. As evidence, our all-weather Mountain Edition Footwear styles were all top sellers and we've already seen significant sell-in for 2016 for these styles as well.", "We're also seeing success with our Mountain Edition weatherized apparel, further extending our brand beyond footwear. And our collaborations, including one with Vans and The North Face, are reinforcing our commitment to blending street style and performance in innovative products and really showing the consumer the strength of the VF portfolio.", "True to our Off the Wall culture, we continue to redefine new ways to connect with our consumers. During the fourth quarter, our PROPELLER skateboarding film saw great success and was one of iTunes top 10 documentaries of the year, not to mention TransWorld SKATEboarding's film of the year.", "Vans was also recently named the number one sneaker brand on Instagram, our young consumers' number one social platform. These are great wins for the brand and great testament to keeping our core consumer at the center of everything we do.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "In Europe, Vans revenue was up at a high-single digit rate, with growth in both D2C and wholesale. During the quarter, we had several strong collaborations worth highlighting. Our second collaboration with Disney was really well received by consumers across footwear, apparel and accessories. The Vans-TNF product sold out in a number of places across Europe, and the Vans Van Doren Collection helped elevate our weatherized offering with great success.", "In our Core Classics Collection, we have seen higher-than-normal inventory levels. And even though we are performing better than our competition in this category, we do anticipate a more challenging sales environment in 2016 as this product works through the channel.", "The good news is that our brand health metrics have never been as strong and our other product categories are selling through extremely well.", "In Asia, Vans grew more than 20%, driven by almost 40% D2C growth and a high-teen increase in our wholesale business. Our House of Vans brand experience proved to be incredible for both the brand and our consumers. We took this experience on tour to 14 cities throughout the year and connected with thousands of fans.", "We also launched our MONKEY RULES campaign for the Chinese New Year and the response shows that this is a winner.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "In 2015, Vans revenue was up 14% globally to reach $2.2 billion, or up 16% excluding FX and the 53rd week. Looking at 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to expand the brand's relevance, updating classic silhouettes, and introducing new styles and collections for the ever-changing global consumer.", "Also, Vans will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2016. We definitely have unique products and experiences planned to keep consumers engaged and connected as we celebrate our authentic heritage.", "Regionally in 2016, we're expecting continued strength with double-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia businesses, which represent about 75% of the total. However, due to the factors KH spoke about, revenues could be down slightly in Europe.", "Our 26 (sic) [2016] (15:31) growth expectation for Vans globally looks to be up in the high-single digit range.", "Now on to Timberland, where global revenues were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis, with slight growth in D2C partially offset by relatively flat wholesale sales. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue was up 5%. Similar to The North Face, Timberland was impacted by warm weather in the fourth quarter too.", "In the Americas, revenue was down in a low-single digit rate, and of course we're comping against the 53rd week so normalized rates are higher. Strategically, we continue to see great response to our efforts to evolve the perception of our outdoor lifestyle positioning.", "Looking at product, boots were a strong performer during the quarter, led by both Classics and women silhouettes. In fact, boots were strong across men's, women's and kids. And beyond just boots, we're continuing to gain traction in some of our more casual styles such as our men's Britton Hill Collection, which had tremendous sell-through in our D2C channel. And in fact, the advertised style completely sold out, so clearly great momentum there.", "We've also made significant progress in the women's business, especially in North America, and created a new generation of brand loyalists who love the style, fit and craftsmanship of the Amston and the Glancy. Early days but super promising and much more coming.", "On the marketing front, we continue to connect with the outdoor lifestyler consumer. During the quarter, our Made For The Modern Trail campaign came to life across print, digital and social media, driving awareness for our Black Forest Collection. All in, our consumer impressions were up 50% at $1.25 billion over last year.", "The PRO Boondock and Powertrain collections saw nice growth in the quarter, and it's clear that we're meeting consumers' needs for footwear that helps them get the job done. The PRO platform continues to be a great living laboratory for learning, testing and introducing new comfort and durability innovations that are very easily translated back into our casual, lifestyle product.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "Timberland European fourth quarter revenue was up at mid-single digit rate, driven by strength in our D2C business, another solid performance during the year that we grew faster than the market.", "In terms of product, SensorFlex and sneakers continue to perform very well in men's casual footwear, and we saw growth in men's outerwear as well. In women's, our classic boots also saw strong results.", "On the marketing side, our Black Forest campaign was our most successful promotion in this region ever. This 360 degree effort enabled us to integrate classic and digital marketing efforts. It also allowed us to team up with our wholesale partners, giving us very visible and unique consumer touch points.", "Turning to Asia, revenues were down slightly, impacted by softer traffic in Hong Kong and Singapore specifically. And despite unusually warm weather for the region, we were encouraged by the strength of our lightweight outerwear which grew double-digits.", "On the footwear side, we saw positive results with boots leading the way, growing at high-teen rate. And similar to Europe, our Black Forest campaign was very successful, driving high levels of interest in the brand.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "In 2015, Timberland revenues were up 10% globally to $1.8 billion, or up 12% excluding FX and the 53rd week. That's great momentum in the Timberland business. And as we look out at 2016, our strategic priorities focus on continuing to elevate style and innovation in product, continued thoughtful expansion of distribution without \u2013 with existing and new customers, as well as our own D2C, and connecting product, experience and lifestyle stories with our global outdoor lifestyle consumer. Based on our fall booking, which is impacted by similar factors at The North Face, we expect Timberland to grow revenue at a high-single digit rate in 2016.", "Now let's shift gears to Jeanswear. Scott?", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America", "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our global Jeanswear business was up 1% on a currency neutral basis driven by mid-single digit growth in the Lee business and a slight decline in Wrangler. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, Jeanswear was up 6% in the fourth quarter.", "In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was flat in the quarter. A low single-digit increase in Lee revenue was offset by a low single-digit decline in Wrangler revenue. At Wrangler, our Mass business showed solid growth with a mid-single digit increase in revenues. This was more than offset by declines in the brand's Western Specialty business where the regions challenged by the contraction in oil and gas exploration are hardest hit.", "From a product perspective, we're successfully expanding the Advanced Comfort line into casuals and warmer-weather product. Additionally, we're working to address the needs of everyday consumers as the outdoor and active categories converge with outdoor-inspired casual solutions and versatile fabrics and functional design aesthetics. We also had a very strong launch of our Cool Vantage product in our Western platform. We do expect the positive momentum that Wrangler realized in 2015 to continue into 2016 as we introduce new products with innovative fabrics that satisfy unmet consumer needs.", "On to Lee. We once again saw growth in this business during the quarter, with the Americas growing in the low-single digits. We're seeing strong response for both male and female consumers to our new performance fabrications, and are excited to introduce even more advanced fabrication offerings in the coming year, including improved breathability and comfort innovations. We have also made great strides as we work to enhance our presence in department stores, clubs and e-commerce. And we are pleased to have grown nicely in 2015. In 2016, we will build on this momentum as we continue to expand our distribution footprint and introduce new product assortments.", "Karl Heinz?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "In Europe, currency neutral revenue for the Jeanswear coalition was up at low-single digit rate. The Wrangler revenues were down slightly in the quarter, with strength in our e-commerce and D2C business offset by declines in our wholesale business. During the quarter, we successfully launched new styles in our Body Bespoke collection and the response has been very positive. We look forward to expanding this collection even more broadly this year.", "Lee's European business marked its eleventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth, with the business up at the mid-single digit rate. New products including the skinny and bootcut jeans for women, and the Malone jeans for men, drove our growth in the quarter.", "In Asia, despite uncertain economic conditions, our Lee business had another solid quarter, with revenue up at the low-double digit rate and very strong profit growth. We are truly becoming a leader in the premium denim segment in Asia driven by our innovations such as our Jade Fusion line and meaningful consumer activations throughout the region. And it's not just consumers who have responded well to this product. We learned that Lee's Jade Fusion has been nominated for an Edison Award, which honors the best innovations as voted by industry peers.", "In summary, we continue to see consistent momentum in our global Jeanswear business and expect to achieve mid-single digit growth once again in 2016.", "Now to Imagewear.", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America", "Fourth quarter Imagewear revenue was down 12% with slight growth in the Licensed Sports Group business, being offset by a more than 20% decline in the workwear business. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, our Imagewear coalition was down 7%. In LSG, our Major League Baseball Cool Base jersey saw sustained momentum in the fourth quarter and finished the year strong. Our street fleece baseball product, which launched during the postseason, also had strong results during the quarter. In 2016, we'll be introducing a new patented flex-based, on-field uniform, which we expect will continue to create healthy demand in this category.", "On the workwear side, our Red Kap Shop Gear collection delivered strong results, posting the sixth year of more than 30% growth. And while our Bulwark line remained very challenged by slower oil and gas exploration, we did see some bright spots, particularly in the iQ knits and woven products. Given the continued softness on the workwear side of the business, we're expecting the Imagewear coalition to grow at a low single-digit rate in 2016.", "Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Our Sportswear business was down 9% in the quarter. If you take out FX and the 53rd week, Sportswear was down 6%. Revenue in Nautica was down low double digits due primarily to lower outlet traffic, tourism declines and record warm weather, which impacted fleece, sweaters, and outerwear purchases. In spite of this, we continue to make progress in our efforts to elevate the Nautica business and realize improved profitability in our wholesale business. In efforts to elevate the brand perception, we successfully tested a full-price pop-up shop in New York City's trendy Flatiron District and received positive consumer feedback during the holiday.", "Kipling's U.S. business saw a low single-digit increase in revenues due to similar factors that impacted Nautica. Kipling's global business was up at a low double digit rate. In 2016, we're expecting a slight decline in revenue for this coalition based primarily on the strategic decision to license Nautica's sleepwear business, which will provide greater profitability in the long run, and on adjusted basis, excluding this move revenue would be up at a low single-digit rate. Revenue in the Contemporary Brands coalition declined 17% during the quarter, with weakness in both the wholesale and D2C business. Excluding FX in the 53rd week contemporary brands was down 10% in the quarter. While we are disappointed with our results in this challenging sector, we are focused on optimizing our product, consumer connections and distribution options. For 2016, we anticipate a mid-single digit decline in the Contemporary Brands coalition.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a deeper dive into our financial results.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Steve. On today's call, you've heard recurrent themes, including things we can't impact like record warm weather, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the 53rd week of 2014, and a softer retail environment. You've also heard us refer to things we can impact like operational and fiscal discipline, executing strategic initiatives and ultimately, how our strengths and agility give us the unique ability to deliver consistent shareholder returns in an uneven environment.", "With both sides of this coin in play, let's review our fourth quarter results and I'll do my best to filter through the noise to illustrate an apples-to-apples story that tells the true performance of VF's model. Starting at the top, revenue was down 1% on a currency-neutral basis or if you normalize for the 53rd week, it was up 3%. This included relative strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses.", "Gross margin came in at 49% on a currency-neutral basis, equal to last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3%, and to walk you through the puts and takes, benefits from changes in mix and favorable product costs were more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory among our brands with greatest exposure to cold weather. As you would expect, we responded quickly with respect to inventory, an effort that enabled us to finish the quarter with levels up just under 9%.", "For context, nearly half of that 9% increase is related specifically to cold weather related product. And, it's important to note that the composition of this inventory is good, it's core product that's already slated for our fall 2016 line. So while inventory levels will remain a bit higher than we'd like for the first half of 2016, we expect them to normalize in the second half of the year.", "Earlier, Steve gave a quick overview of our contemporary brands coalition. Suffice it to say that it was a disappointing year for our business, one in which we fell short of our expectations. As a result, the fair values of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands were determined to be below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we have recorded $144 million pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets of these brands. After tax, this was a $97 million charge or $0.23 of diluted EPS.", "Adjusted SG&A, that is, excluding the impairment charge, was down 40 basis points in the quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation, with operating leverage and expense control. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted operating income was down 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared with 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, operating income was 11.6% compared to 5.1% last year.", "And finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.98 in the same period of 2015. Adjusted currency neutral EPS was up 5%, and if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 12%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.72, up significantly over last year's fourth quarter.", "Turning now to the full year. 2015 revenue grew 6% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue increased 7%. Highlights included 9% growth in both our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses, and 7% growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which comped positively for the full year. Apples-to-apples, Outdoor & Action Sports and D2C were up 11% year-over-year.", "We also benefited from improved performance in our Jeanswear coalition, which, although it carries lower gross margins than VF's average, it's still our most profitable coalition.", "Gross margin was down 0.5 point to 48.3%. To walk you through the full year factors, our mix benefit was present but slightly less than that about 50 basis points we typically see due to improved Jeanswear performance and softer than expected D2C results. And while we did see the expected tailwind from lower product costs, our aggressive management of inventory offset this benefit. So that leaves us with FX, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points.", "SG&A for the year, as a percentage of total revenue, was down 10 basis points due to the same discipline we exhibited in the fourth quarter. That is, offsetting investments in our fastest-growing businesses and strategic priorities by maintaining strong cost controls across other areas in the organization. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted currency neutral operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion, and operating margin was 14.6% in 2015 compared with 14.9% in the prior year. Taking into account the 70-basis-point foreign currency hit, we achieved an operating margin of 15.3% in spite of top line pressure.", "On a reported basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion in 2015, and operating margin was 13.4% compared with 11.7% in 2014. So that brings us to a full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.08, in line with 2014's result. On a currency neutral basis, EPS was up 12%. Now, at the end of year three of our five-year plan, we've averaged 13% EPS growth annually, which is right in line with our long-term guidance. On a GAAP basis, full year EPS was up 20% to $2.85.", "We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to afford us great flexibility. In 2015, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Turning now to 2016. While we do expect some challenges to continue in the near-term, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders, and here's why. Our portfolio of brands with its diversity of consumer, geography and channel is supported by a deep arsenal of P&L levers including strategic investments, focused operational discipline and a world-class supply chain, all of which deliver superior cash flow. Working in concert, these strengths will allow us the flexibility necessary to emerge even stronger coming out of 2016.", "We expect revenue in 2016 to grow at a mid-single digit percentage rate, including about a 1% impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. On both a reported and currency neutral basis, our plans include growth in every region, as well as in our wholesale and D2C channels. By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single digit rate, with similar increases for Vans and Timberland, and mid-single digit growth for The North Face brand. In Jeanswear, we expect the momentum to continue with mid-single digit revenue growth. And to round it out, we're expecting low single-digit growth for Imagewear, a slight decline in Sportswear and mid-single digit decline in Contemporary Brands business.", "We expect momentum in the international and direct-to-consumer business to continue in 2016. International revenue is expected to be up at a high single digit rate on a currency neutral basis or mid-single digits on a reported basis. By region, in Europe, we expect mid-single digit increase in currency neutral revenues, up low single digit reported. In our Asia-Pacific region, currency neutral revenue should be up at a low double-digit percentage rate or up high single digit reported. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we are expecting revenue to grow a low teen percentage rate on a currency neutral basis or up low single digits reported.", "Our D2C business should accelerate in 2016 with revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit currency neutral rate with about a point of negative impact due to changes in FX. For the year, we expect to increase our total store count to about 1,600 doors compared with 1,520 at the end of 2015. Comp sales growth are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, including growth of more than 20% in e-commerce.", "On now to gross margin. We expect 2016 gross margin rate to improve by 50 basis points to reach 48.8% or 49.5% on a currency neutral basis. To click down into the drivers, we estimate a combination of product costs and pricing benefits to be equally offset by 70 basis points of FX headwinds. That leaves 50 basis points of mix benefit to flow through as Outdoor & Action Sports, international and D2C continue to drive gross margin expansion.", "In terms of SG&A, we will continue to make strategic investments in our brands with respect to product innovation and demand creation, as well as investing in our growing D2C business. In addition to store openings, we continue to make significant investments in our e-commerce capabilities, specifically bringing additional brands onto the common VF platform. These investments, along with continued pressure from foreign currency rate changes, should result in a modest increase in our SG&A ratio in 2016. This brings us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 14.4% in 2016, net of an anticipated 70 basis points of foreign currency impact.", "Moving to the bottom line, we expect currency neutral EPS to be up 11% in 2016 or up 5% reported compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015. And as you think about the cadence of revenue and earnings, there's a few things to keep in mind. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency neutral revenue to be about flat with the first quarter of 2015.", "With respect to earnings, recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a one-time $17 million gain related to the sale of a VF outlet store. Additionally, we expect the first quarter will see the most difficult FX comparison of the year, with an estimated 120 basis point negative hit to gross margin. Therefore, we anticipate currency neutral EPS to be about flat or down low double digits as reported.", "In the second quarter of 2016 revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency neutral EPS or high single digit as reported. Recall that last year's second quarter benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits.", "Currency neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate, with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second-half EPS to increase at a mid to high teen percentage rate. Our outlook for cash from operations remains very strong as we expect to generate $1.3 billion in 2016.", "And finally, our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders has never been more evident. In 2016, we expect our share buyback to reach about $1 billion, which is a meaningful increase over the prior year. And to echo what Eric said earlier, this increase is in response to cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholders, not an indication that we are changing our capital allocation priorities. In fact, our first priority remains acquisition. And as previously mentioned, our intention is to take a much more proactive approach to our portfolio composition this year. So share buyback combined with our annual dividend should return $1.5 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2016. That's a 15% increase in shareholder returns over 2015.", "In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are very proud of what we've accomplished in 2015. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. We've demonstrated time and time again, our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. This speaks to the agility of the VF model. We are highly confident that the power of our portfolio, along with numerous flexible levers, will enable us to drive revenue growth and profitability, mitigate risk and most importantly, create value for our shareholders.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to the operator and open it up for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "So, I wanted to ask you, and as far as I can remember, I can't remember a quarter where what you guided to ended up being so different than what you reported and what you experienced. So I'm just trying to get an understanding of where the biggest changes were post-October when you gave us the most recent guidance. Also want to understand a little bit deeper where you think the implied guidance for 2016 in the second half revenue is to really reaccelerate on a constant-currency basis. And then, lastly, on the question of revenues, did you see anything in the quarter post the October timeframe between the lines that gave you any indication or insight into what's really going on with the consumer, whether it's macro or behavioral changes, et cetera? Thanks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Omar, it's Eric. I'll start trying to tackle your questions. So, where was the biggest \u2013 well, what caused the big miss, and you're right, we haven't had change like that to our expectations happen before to that degree of magnitude. As you know from looking at all the retailers who are reporting, there was a significant slowdown in consumer spending from what everyone expected in the fourth quarter. So that hit everybody in all categories. It particularly hit cold weather apparel and footwear, and that's a big piece of our business. So we were unusually impacted by it, and we came out of it with only 9% more inventory.", "And the implications of that were we understand the carrying that inventory was probably not the right thing to do, so we aggressively got rid of it and that affected our earnings. That was a big driver of the earnings miss, was the investment we made to end the year with only 9% more inventory than last year. So, it was that combination that got to the EPS miss that we had. We think that was a smarter choice than getting closer to our guided EPS and ending the year with significant excess inventory. The \u2013 how we're looking at next year. Scott guided \u2013 gave pretty clear guidance to how we're seeing the first half, which suggests that we \u2013 there is an inventory overhang out there. Some vendors have it, we have a little bit of it, Scott mentioned that about half the 9% was in Outdoor and cold-weather products.", "So that's going to slow things down here in the first half. And then as we approach the second half, we're cautious in our outlook for next winter's weather and consumer behavior, more cautious than we have been in the past. We have the early part of that season booked and that's reflected in our guidance, and we're coming up against really easy numbers for us to beat, unless maybe it's going to be 80 degrees in New York next winter, I don't know. But if \u2013 I think the odds are that the winter weather will be a little kinder around the world to us. So with a cautious outlook and really easy numbers to lap, that's why we are more confident about the growth in the second half, and we're off the growth rates we've had as \u2013 but we've said during the call, we've been averaging 7% a year for the last couple of years, and we're calling it mid-single digits until we see how this plays out.", "I think your last question was anything post all this that we learned about the consumers and I don't know that we have. There were interesting product categories that slowed down and most of the material impact for us was weather-related. It really hit our cold-weather brands. I'm looking down the table to see if anybody has more insight than I do on that, but I don't think there's any macro trends that we're seeing other than consumer spending is a little soft and we think that will continue. Our expectations for 2016 assumes that, that continues through the first half of the year.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good luck.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Omar.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hey, Bob.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "I guess, on the Outdoor coalition, I think given your guidance in terms of all the points you just made in terms of the second half, are the order books complete or how far are they complete in terms of The North Face as you look for fall next year? And when you talk about looking at the portfolio and actively exploring business expansion, and you also talked a little bit more about less exposure, Eric, when you think about it, is it more likely to have disposals or an acquisition, like how do you think about exactly what we should take away from that statement?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hey, Bob. I'll take the order book question you had for the Outdoor coalition and then I'll toss it back to Eric on the portfolio. I would tell you, the Outdoor coalition, our order books are certainly on our hands for spring and they're reflected in our guidance. But it's too early for us to tip our hat on fall. I would tell you we are looking at cautious consumer or retailer behavior, but we're no more confident than ever on the quality of the product and our ability to react to the trends that we saw coming through Q4. Our Vans business remains extremely strong, and North Face and Timberland both have great strategies in place to react.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "On the shape of the portfolio, Bob, the \u2013 I'm obviously not going to disclose anything specific in this \u2013 on this call today. But know that as we look back over the last four years, because we \u2013 people have said, you haven't made an acquisition in four years and, we quite frankly, haven't made a divestiture in four years or five years either. So \u2013 and you talked about being active portfolio managers, so how do you define active? And what we're saying now is we're defining active as being active.", "And I think the fair and honest assessment of the last four years is when we acquired Timberland, for the next two years, we were not in the acquisition market, period, flat out, we were not. We were very focused on delivering the shareholder returns that we promised to our shareholders with the biggest acquisition we ever made, and we've done that. But for the last two years, we've not made an acquisition. We are actively exploring everything in our portfolio and everything that we might want to have in our portfolio with a level of activity that hasn't existed for the last few years, and we think it's likely something will change this year. I can't give you any more guidance about how that change might happen.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Got it. And when we look at some of the more challenged pieces of the business, I guess, in the fourth quarter but throughout last year, when you look at your assumptions going forward, do you believe that you're being conservative enough in terms of \u2013 whether in some portions of the workwear business or the Sportswear business or the Contemporary businesses?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Bob, I think I'll take that. I think we feel confident in our ability to understand where we are. In the case of some of these sectors, for example, the Contemporary, we continue to be disappointed in the trends going on there, but could not be more confident in the teams that we have as we maintain our number one share, though perhaps that's not as important as it was in the past as that sector's under great pressure. Workwear, we've got, by far, two of the strongest brands, Bulwark and Red Kap, and teams that deeply understand their marketplace. And the business development teams really focus on expanding beyond the sectors that we win in when some of those commodities are moving our direction. So I would say we have confidence in our plan, extreme confidence in our teams that are in place to deliver those.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Bob, I'll lean into that just a little bit. Of all those things that Steve just mentioned, the one that drives the most earnings potential for us is the workwear business, which is really on its heels right now. We've been through this cycle at least a half a dozen times in the last 20 years where for macroeconomic reasons or things like the oil industry shutting down that's happening right now, we get hurt and then \u2013 that happens pretty quickly. And then it comes back. And when it comes back, there's years of goodness. You'll recall because we talked about it in 2010 and 2011. Bulwark was our fastest-growing brand. And it's really a good thing for our shareholders when the recovery happens and we know it's inevitable, we're not planning on it next year.", "Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Kate, are you there? We can't hear you. Might be muted.", "Operator", "Kate, please check your phone line. I'm not hearing a response. We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the high single-digit guidance for Outdoor & Action Sports. Can you parse out ASP growth versus unit growth? Should we assume three percentage points for ASPs? And if that's the case, how has it changed over the prior years? And what are you seeing in terms of ASPs with regards to the competitive landscape?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I will start and maybe, Steve, chime in. So, as a general statement, we don't quote specific percentages on what our price increases are, but we've said that's a big part of our model. And that would be true in Outdoor & Action Sports, right? We price both like-for-like and probably even more importantly, bringing new product. Remember, every season, more than half of our product is new and we are merchandising the new price points. And that's how we've maintained our margins. So, you saw it in our guidance as you look forward. We've got 70 basis points of price and rate improvement, which would be the proof point that, that model is intact, and indeed, we are seeing those prices come through.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, I wouldn't have much to add to that, Laurent, other than our team has spent a tremendous amount of time looking at consumer and market analytics to guide their seasonal product creation strategies, and really targeting price value relationships in each of those categories across the globe, each and every region.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then I wanted to follow up on the comments made earlier that you are actively exploring segments of the business that you might want to be less exposed to. Curious to know if there are any metrics we should think about with regards to this comment. Should we think about profitability, anticipated revenue growth over the next few years, or metrics tied to demographics, channels or geographies? And if it's all of the above, how would you rank them?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I guess the answer is all of the above because when we look at our company to think about what the shape of the portfolio would be, we look across the company. As I said, we're not \u2013 I can't disclose anything today and won't, but know that when we exit a category, it's either for a strategic reason or a financial reason, meaning the business isn't aligned with us strategically, or it's unable to contribute to our shareholders financially. Either one has ended up to be a good move for us when we exit out of something.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much, and best of luck.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning. So, I guess my question, as we think about the 11% constant currency EPS forecast for this year versus the 13% multiyear target CAGR that you have out there, a number of headwinds, you clearly walked through them for this year. But is there any reason to think the 13% needs to change in 2017 and beyond? And then separately, your 16% EBIT margin target, while we might not get there in 2017, is there any reason to think that this is no longer the goal of multiyear?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Matthew, the answers are no and no. And we still have line of sight. We obviously \u2013 when we made our original plan, we said at that time that we weren't assuming any change in currency translation to affect the plan, and we've had a boatload of that happen to us. But we are on track to hit our numbers, we believe, and don't think that \u2013 on a currency neutral basis. I'm glad we have the 53rd week story behind us now, because that just complicated the discussion for all of us. But we're pretty confident in the growth rates in the top and bottom line that we're going to be able to achieve. We missed the top line. We're a little light there. We didn't anticipate some of the challenges that have happened around the world, but on an EPS basis, we're tracking right on plan. Scott, do you want to add anything to that from a profitability basis?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I guess two things. I think the best evidence of the future is what you have done, right? So as Eric said in his comments, we've averaged 13% over the last three years, and we're a little slower in the top line for all the reasons we talked about today. That is a short-term bump, that's not long term. And really, what gives me confidence looking forward is the model, right? That gross margin expansion that we talked about, the levers that we have from an efficiency standpoint and the powerful brands. I see no reason why we don't go back to that over the long term. It doesn't change anything.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just a quick follow-up. On the gross margin guide for 2016, the 120 basis point constant currency expansion that you're embedding there ex-FX...", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Right.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "...could you just help walk through what you're seeing from a product cost and a pricing perspective embedded within that?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we're really not breaking that down. Again, it's 70 basis points. It's kind of simple if you think about your margin going forward, right? You got 70 basis points negative currency headwinds, you got 70 basis points positive on price and cost, and then you got the 50 basis points of mix falling through, and that's really \u2013 your margin is 50 basis points plus the 70 basis points, gets you the 120 basis points that you referenced. So we're not breaking it down, but again, as I mentioned earlier, be assured that pricing is a big part of our model and we're pulling that lever along with merchandising to maintain our margins.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Best of luck.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Can you hear me this time?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hi, Kate.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Kate.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. I promise I wasn't on mute. I think I was disconnected. But anyway, thank you for taking my questions. My question is on the brands, first with The North Face. I think we've had warm winters in the past, and when we take a look at winter 2011, I think there was still \u2013 you still posted double-digit growth for the brand at the time. So can you help us understand maybe what the difference is between this warm winter versus previous warm winters as we think of the supply chain, and things that you've employed have only gotten better over time, and what we should expect going forward if warm winter hits again?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Kate, I'll take that. Let me first start by saying this brand is absolutely still the double-digit growth driver that we've said it is. As you kind of look over the four years in our five-year plan, and to your point on what we saw in 2012, we had two years where we had record warm weather. In 2013, we grew at a rate of 7%. 2014, where we had a more normal winter, we grew at 12%. And then this year where we saw the warmest winter on record, we were up 5%.", "We've talked to you all about how we are pivoting this brand to be more competitive in a four-quarter type business model. And I think some of the results that you saw this year absolutely show that we're doing that. Our Thermoball franchise, which is a fantastic three-season outerwear franchise, continues to grow. Performance apparel with our Mountain Athletics group up 40%, our equipment category growing double-digits, re-launch of our premier Summit Series collection, and multi-sport footwear growing double-digits. We are pivoting to be more responsive and more capable to navigate these kinds of extreme weather conditions. The realignment of the category merchandising model that I referenced is absolutely kind of fine-tuning what we've already done with our activity-based model. So we see huge opportunities still from a category channel and geographic expansion standpoint for this brand.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, thank you. And then, my second brand question was on Vans. I think Karl Heinz had mentioned slowness in the Core Classics category in Europe. I think last quarter, you attributed some slowness in Vans from shipping, timing changes in Vans. Can you talk to us about what's happening with that brand internationally and, again, what we should expect over the long term for the brand growth internationally?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "Sure, Kate. I'll start with Asia, I think you heard the numbers in Asia are good. We had stellar performance in Asia and we believe in the future there are no clouds there.", "Europe is a little bit different. First of all, the brand is really strong. We don't see a brand problem, right? We see that when analyzing our metrics. We see how we do with the competition and we see our product initiative. It is true, though, that there is a product issue in the market, which affects not only us but affects the entire market, which is on this Classic style. That's why we guided a little bit softer for 2016 because we need time to digest this. But the brand is very strong and we are very confident. All the great numbers we had in the past outside 2016, we have no reasons to believe that we have an issue with the brand.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Good morning, everyone. As you think about this new environment and the channels and geography and new customer profile, as you think about each division and their contribution to operating income going forward, does that change at all? Is there any puts and takes on margins or expenses on each division to be aware of, that makes things different than what have been expected go-forward? Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dana. That's a really good question and actually we haven't had that question before. That doesn't happen to us that often. So, well done.", "Thinking about it quickly and from a high level, we have, by brand, strategies right through \u2013 for the next five years that we're looking at, and they include everything that we anticipate in the changes in shopper behavior. And so, we don't see that causing a fundamental change to the mechanics of our P&L, which I think was your question. We don't see that, but that's \u2013 I'm looking around the room to see if anybody else sees anything that I don't see. So, no.", "What we will continue to see is an expansion in our D2C business, particularly through e-commerce, and expansion of our international business, which as you know very well is very profitable business for us. And because the tax rates are lower outside United States than they are in United States, that helps us create shareholder value, and we still have a lot of opportunity outside United States.", "Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dana.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, just two quick ones, guys. I guess, first, I know this is kind of a fungible line, but how would you over assess the overall sales of what you'd consider to be non-weather-impacted goods?", "And then I guess second, with the gross margin investment you had to make to clear and get the inventory level under control, is it your understanding that the goods are actually sold through or is some of that investment potential going toward folks that may end up packing that inventory away? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'll take a stab at this one, Ed. I think sales on the non-weather-impacted businesses or categories were very strong. In the case of The North Face, I referenced the success we saw with our Mountain Athletics collection, up 40%; the ThermoBall franchise continuing to grow nicely, not just here in the U.S. but globally; our Vans business had another breakout year, up 16% when you take into effect the FX and the 53rd week. I would tell you, all those would be non-weather-related businesses.", "But even there, the Mountain Edition collection, both footwear and apparel, saw significant sell-through, giving it great momentum going into this year. So, it really is those heavily insulated styles where we saw the slowdown.", "I'm sorry, Scott will grab that second portion.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I guess the question on the second part of that was the aggressive inventory actions, where do we think that inventory ultimately ended up. And I guess the answer is, we can't really definitively answer that.", "Let me tell you what the actions we took were, right? So, it was varied. We discounted through our own outlets and our own full price retail. In some cases, we sold some off-priced goods. And the weather has turned a bit this year so far in 2016. So certainly, some of that has sold through, hard to speculate how much.", "Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, good morning. So, I had two quick questions. Number one, could you talk a little bit about the wholesale business in Europe? It seemed to me from the comments \u2013 and obviously I understand that you have a mix shift to D2C globally, but nonetheless it seemed to me that there were some weakness relative to expectation in Europe at wholesale. So, can you talk a little bit about what's going on in that channel broadly?", "And I guess, just my second question, a follow-up, I think it was Ed that asked the question about weather versus non-weather. Is there any way you can kind of bottom-line it and tell us \u2013 you've broken out the FX impact and the cycling of the 53rd week impact on revenue, can you give a range of estimate of what the total impact to revenues was due to the weather? Thanks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "So, Dave, maybe I'll start with the first question, the wholesale scenario in Europe. I think Eric mentioned it in his opening script. The first nine months actually, we were tracking as we had planned. We were growing mid-single digit as per our plan. The challenge was more in the last quarter, where the weather affected us as well. I think it was widely reported, and that particularly challenged our cold winter brands.", "On the other one, Kipling for instance, Eastpak, we did actually pretty well. So, we're not affected there. All in all, I think also snow came and it got cold in Europe, a little bit later but it came. So, inventories are pretty normalized now, so that is good news.", "The second part of the question \u2013 what was the second part?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Weather-related potential impact.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we haven't quantified what that might be.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Right.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. The first is, you mentioned one of your long-term strengths being your best-in-class supply chain. I was hoping that you could give us any insight as to whether you have specific initiatives this year to make you guys faster or more efficient or any other benefits that could accrue to the business from supply chain innovation?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Lindsay, I'll start with that, and then I'll have Scott Baxter pipe in on something specific going on in Jeanswear. Speed and nimbleness within our supply chain is top of mind and it always is. In fact, our internal production is extremely responsive and is one of the key strengths of our Jeanswear businesses, and we're looking at being able to transfer that type of thinking through our Third Way programs into the sourced side of the business.", "And then on top of that, with our new Innovation Centers now in place and up and running, we have some specific projects both in our Jeanswear and Technical Apparel groups partnering with our supply chain on longer-term advanced manufacturing initiatives that would absolutely make us more nimble, add speed, partnered with the upstream merchandising capabilities within our businesses where we are constantly looking at ways to really reduce lead times, increase frequency of flow to be more relevant and more frequent in front of our consumers. And Scott might want to talk to you a little bit about something going on in Jeanswear.", "Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America", "Yeah, I most certainly can. We have a project going on right now. And, Lindsay, as you know, we own our factories in this hemisphere, and we actually use those factories and are planning on using those factories as a weapon. It's a strategic advantage for us to have those here. And we've really embarked upon a project with our Jeanswear teams on taking our cycle times down. So from concept till the time a consumer can purchase that product, we are really working on and have a pretty, pretty big project going on on how we take that lead time down, how we work throughout our entire supply chain in combination with our merchant team, and bringing the consumer the products that they're looking for much quicker and much faster than we have in the past.", "And then in combination with that, we have a parallel program where we're working on some small batch programs where we can go ahead and get in style and get on trend really quickly, where we haven't done that as fast as we'd like in the past.", "So, those two projects are going on right now at Jeanswear and we're pretty happy with the progress we're making. And I can talk about that in the future as we progress down the line.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. I think you mentioned that for Vans America, that the wholesale business was a bit weak. Could you expand on some of the specific drivers there? And just a quick housekeeping question. Can you confirm that the 53rd week had no impact on operating profit in the quarter or was there an impact? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "I'll talk about Vans and then I'll let Scott talk about the operating profit. And I think this is the fourth quarter softness that you've heard us and others talk about, had some impact on our Vans wholesale business. Certainly, Karl Heinz spoke specifically about a Classics inventory build in a couple of our key markets having an impact on our wholesale build. We really see that working through over the course of the year.", "I think it's important to note though, we have a number of styles, other collections. For example, our Sk8-Hi, Old Skool that are performing extremely well and much stronger than our competition. And I think another catalyst there would be our D2C and e-commerce performance that continues to perform very, very strongly, and it's really that balanced model between wholesale and D2C for our Vans business that allows it to continue to show such significant growth.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, and just to add on the second part of your question about the 53rd week, sure, it of course has an impact on profit. Probably, a couple of points for the year, so the 12% would be a couple points higher. And remember what Eric said, if you want to take that noise out and look over the last two years, we averaged 13%, and that's probably the right way to look at it.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. You guys alluded to briefly of the off-price lever that you pulled in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about your exposure overall to off-price versus what the norm would normally be in this season? And then, when you talked to those partners post-season, what is their appetite to take on more products just given the abundance of inventory out there in the channel?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "I think as we look at the off-price lever, our businesses, we have our outlet stores that are our first choice, where you see us holding the inventory that Scott referenced. When we look outside of our model, we've got some very strategic partners that have worked with us very, very well over the years.", "Our exposure year-over-year is up slightly but not to a degree that would have us at all concerned. And I can't really speak to the appetite for them. I can tell you in our quick movement and strong relationship, we feel very good with where we are with our inventories going into next year. And not really sure \u2013 can't really comment on how those partners sit in their relative business.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Erinn, I'll add to that. As I said this, I think it was Omar's question at the very beginning, we reacted early and aggressively to the slowdown that we saw coming at us and it was only 9% growth in inventory. And we think that's going to look pretty good versus some others in our space.", "And so, we moved on our inventory. Now, that came at an earnings per share cost, it absolutely did have a gross margin rate cost, but we would rather come into this year with as much of that behind us as possible versus dragging around a big inventory anchor for the next six months to nine months, maybe 12 months, and we think some people are going to be doing that.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. No, I appreciate that. And then I'm sorry if I missed this, just as a housekeeping on the guidance for 2016, but in Imagewear how are you thinking about the first half versus the second half? It seems that things aren't getting broadly better in Texas or some of the other oil and kind of gas-producing regions. I'm curious what's driving that improvement to the low-single digit positive rate in 2016 versus where you exited in fourth quarter. Thanks.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "This is Scott. So obviously, Erinn, you heard that we're actually coming out of the gates a little bit slower in the first half, but through business development opportunities and also a focused team around the Red Kap and Bulwark brand we do feel that the positive momentum in the second half will continue that we've had in previous years.", "And I think the most important piece of that is we do have some big product introductions. So, it's a product story there too. We've got our continuation of our shop (01:11:46) line, which kicks off several big new initiatives and big items in the second half. So, we're feeling more confident as the economy kind of moves ahead forward in the next half of next year.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Thanks you, guys, and best of luck.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Eric, can you hear me okay?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I can, Robby. Can you hear me?", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. For the last question, I was hoping that you could talk about Greater China and maybe tell us what you guys are seeing there right now, maybe even go through Vans, TNF, Jeanswear and Timberland, and sort of the just broad brush strokes 2016 assumptions for Greater China? Thanks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, Robby, Karl Heinz is going to take that question for us. I'm actually a little under the weather today, so I'm trying to reduce my talking.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "Okay, Robert, I think you heard me saying, I always tend to give the same answer, China is a marathon for us, it's a great opportunity long term. I mean many people talk about China, the slowdown in China. The fact is when we talk China, it's Greater China, we grew 13% in constant dollars in 2015, and that includes Hong Kong which was widely reported being down because of the tourists. So, Mainland China was even higher for us. And we expect similar numbers for 2016.", "So actually, we're performing well in China. As you know, we are active with primarily four brands; The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Kipling. For the rest, we have a distributor model. So, there's a long way to go. We have about 2,500 doors on four brands, which, benchmarking to large players, where they play about (01:13:33) 5,000, 6,000, 7,000. So, we have a long way to go there.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then on Jeanswear?", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "Jeanswear, we act with Lee in China. And I mentioned that in my script, it's doing extremely well. We have a leadership position there in that market driven by product innovation. The Jade, I mentioned, we are a candidate to win an award. We're really doing well. We're up this year again double-digit, and, no, it's good, it's really good.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, there's no assumption of a China slowdown \u2013 a significant China slowdown in 2016 in what you gave us today?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We see Greater China in two halves. There absolutely has been a slowdown in Hong Kong. Our business is really strong in Mainland China, and the two of those together, we're up 13%, as Karl Heinz said, which tells you how strong the Mainland China business is. And we're not anticipating it being much better or worse. We're right in that zone of up 13%.", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International", "And clearly, I mean...", "Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's very helpful. Eric, I hope you feel better soon.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Robby.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Eric Wiseman for any closing or additional remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, just a quick comment. First, thank you for taking so much time with us today. Look, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter numbers for sure, but we're not disappointed in our performance for last year. We think we threaded the needle really well coming through a very surprising and difficult fourth quarter, and that we're positioned to put ourselves right back on track towards our 2017 growth rates that we've talked about.", "As we've said, we have a cautious outlook for this year at this point, and we think that's a prudent thing to do. And we'll give you another update in April. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of IR. Please go ahead, sir.", "Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF's second quarter 2016 results. I'd like to remind everyone that participates on today's call we'll make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in currency-neutral terms which we've defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 a.m. Eastern Time this morning. We use currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.", "You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items.", "On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business which includes the 7 for All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands. Appropriately, we have classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and therefore have moved their results into discontinued operations.", "Therefore, unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations. Removing this business from the mix impacts the P&L for both 2015 and 2016 and we have furnished a full year 2015 P&L which designates the impacts. There is more detail in the press release we issued this morning.", "Joining us on today's call will be VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; President of our International Business, Karl Heinz Salzburger; and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments. In over both the short and long-term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. We are a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident but comes from experience, judgment and a track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product in retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with a total performance-based approach to shareholder return.", "The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit, is exactly the quarter where consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations and that our first half of 2016 came in as promised. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year.", "So let's dig down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected, but overall the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago.", "Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team. Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3%, featured our fastest growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter.", "To round it out, our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outward environment. And though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year.", "In February, we said that we intended to take a focused and proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we are well-positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders. During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing, and while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and like, we have every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success.", "You're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our LSG business within the Imagewear coalition. This process is ongoing, and we'll update you when we have something more to report.", "Now, back to some highlights. Our second quarter direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single-digit increase in the U.S., and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis 9 of our 10 largest brands saw revenue increases. Our e-commerce business continued strong momentum as well, with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally, as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggish first half of 2016, trends we expect to continue into our third quarter. Our international sales were up 7% overall, with Europe up 3%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%.", "Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35, so a penny better than our original outlook, but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth.", "Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook. And to address head-on, what some have called out as concerns, I'd tell you that, yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and D2C additions in both brick and click to support this expected growth. Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015. Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter, and that too is baked in. And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy, yet we are up against what is by far our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015, so math's on our side as well.", "That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvements in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholder returns. It's what you come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, revenue was up 2% in the second quarter driven by a low-double digit increase in D2C and a low-single digit decrease in wholesale. This result was about what we expected 90 days ago, and keep in mind, the second quarter is Outdoor & Action Sports' smallest quarter of the year both from a revenue and earnings perspective. So in total, we checked the box.", "Now, let's take a look at VF largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results. On the wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single digit rate due to bankruptcies and an order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter.", "During the second quarter, warmer weather categories including sportswear product and accessories saw significant momentum and were up 40% and 60% respectively. In men's fleece sales doubled, driven by a strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. In women's, newer silhouettes like the Tomales Bay jacket are also seeing strong response, and we're very proud that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their Summer Buyer's Guide, including our Favero 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring/summer assortment is working.", "We're also supporting our spring/summer relevancy through consumer experiences, like our Endurance Challenge Series of trail races, which drew over 13,000 attendees across events this past spring, and community workouts that we sponsor twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C.", "In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated the retail experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete team, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information. During the opening weekend, North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360\u00b0, 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Moab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represents how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months. Now to K.H.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "Good morning, everyone. The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenues up at the low teen rate, driven by more than 25% growth in DTC and a mid-single digit increase in our wholesale business. And the growth was balanced and broad-based too, with double-digit increases in the U.K., Germany, Benelux, Italy and Spain.", "A great product highlight was our footwear business, which grew more than 20%. This was supported by marketing campaigns and product styles to help build on the momentum the team has been working on. Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had a successful start to the year with over 60% sell-through in wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC.", "In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the mid-teen rate, which was about in line with our expectations. This result was driven by low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business, which was offset by weak wholesale results due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter.", "During the quarter, we launched our Water Adventure Series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags. In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable, breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors. To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers. Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions. Globally, the first half of 2016 finished well for The North Face and we are right on track to reach our full year expectations of mid-single digit growth. Now, on to Vans.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Vans global revenue was up 6% in the second quarter with a mid-teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. With nice sequential improvement from the first quarter, regional, product and channel performances were in line with our plan.", "Looking at regions, in the Americas, revenue was up at a high-single digit rate with a low-double digit increase in D2C, including over 25% growth in e-commerce and a mid-single digit increase in wholesale.", "During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classics offerings, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool side stripes styles driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons.", "During the quarter, Vans launched another exciting collaboration with Nintendo celebrating their iconic video game heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception to this collaboration has been phenomenal and it's performing well against expectations which is no easy feat given it's up against the massive Disney launch of last year's second quarter. With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year on March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country. In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, creative workshops and documentary screenings.", "In June, the Vans Warped Tour kicked off its 22nd year, bringing music, Vans culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country, and tomorrow the U.S. Open of Surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach where the world's elite in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium. As a complete immersion into Vans' culture, this festival-wide celebration of action sports, creative expression and youth culture is about as core as it gets.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "Vans revenue in Europe was down at the high-single digit rate, the low-double digit increase in DTC offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale. These results were on track with what we expected 90 days ago as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory. With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail.", "Nintendo was also a success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs. Notably, on the first day of the Nintendo launch, e-commerce had its best sales day ever.", "In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single digit increase in our wholesale business. E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business. And similar to the Americas and Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first four weeks and e-commerce sell-through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations at key stores, including our retail lab in Korea, so very pleased with these results.", "With the first half behind us and the momentum building for Vans globally, there are no changes to our full year outlook for high-single digit growth. Now, on to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Timberland global revenue was down 7%, with a low-single digit increase in D2C offset by a low-double digit decline in wholesale sales. While these results were for the most part in line with our expectations for the brand's smallest quarter, as we enter the second half of the year, we have seen higher than anticipated inventory levels, particularly in our Americas business, and anticipate a more challenging sales environment. Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel.", "Similar to the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory imbalance versus a brand issue and we're tempering sell-in for a quarter or two to allow inventory to normalize. Timberland continues to outperform its competition, including market share gains and the brand health metrics that we track including awareness, conversion and sell-through remain strong. In fact, sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short-term, normalizing some times in the fourth quarter.", "Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high-teen rate, with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single digit rate. Keep in mind that three quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the Americas is outlet-based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic. Notable in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce, so solid online growth. Product wise, men's boots continue to be relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland Boot Company collection, driven by a new micro site launch, saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collection's premium price points.", "On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst and Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever through a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year.", "And finally, with oil rig counts reaching an all-time low in May, the entire Workwear category, including our Industrial Pro business remains under significant pressure.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "Revenue in Europe was up at a high-single digit rate for the quarter, driven by low-teen DTC growth. A huge contributor to this came from our e-commerce channel where the brand transitioned to VF's global digital platform, enabling faster, closer consumer engagement and more effective handling of the site. The wholesale channel increased as well by a mid-single digit rate.", "Looking at products, after a very successful SensorFlex campaign, we drove traffic through summer heritage collections in men's and women's boat shoes. With our new advertising campaign in digital and traditional media, we doubled our consumer reach and executed a seamless campaign in more than 600 store windows. In apparel, we continued our improvement of the product in terms of fit, fabric and style, and did see very nice progress with our spring 2016 collections, driving low-double digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there.", "Similarly, Asian revenue was down high-single digits primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth including apparel, which was up more than 60% in China. In June, we opened a new workshop retail store in Shanghai, and we have seen strong early results.", "We're taking a prudent approach to the second half, and we now expect low-single digit global revenue growth for Timberland in 2016. Now to Jeanswear.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "In the second quarter, our global Jeanswear business was up 6% with strong growth across both Wrangler and Lee. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth for the Jeanswear coalition. So once again, hats off to the global team.", "In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenues were up at a mid-single digit rate, driven by a mid-single digit increase for Wrangler and a low-double digit increase for Lee. Wrangler's mass business remains strong with a high-single digit increase that marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. The story there remains the same, a strong, collaborative retail partnership with the mutual goal of bringing innovation and value to consumers.", "Our innovation story is stronger than ever. Wrangler Advanced Comfort outdoor performance shorts and Riders by Lee denim shorts and capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. In contrast, and a trend we've spoken about over the past few quarters, our Western Specialty business was down as the oil and gas exploration communities continue to be hard hit.", "Lee saw excellent consumer response to the new, innovative X-Treme Comfort men's casual pant that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth through new shelf space as well as expanded distribution. And in a nod to the ultimate blend of elegance and performance, American ballet star, Misty Copeland, is pictured wearing Lee Dream Jean in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. We saw very strong retail sales of Lee's seasonal products, including shorts and capris, especially once the weather turned warmer in May.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "In Europe, revenue for the Jeanswear coalition was up at a high-single digit rate, driven by a mid-teen increase for Lee and a mid-single digit increase for Wrangler. Lee saw great success in the quarter, driven by positive results across all categories. A couple of highlights include continuing double-digit trends in our top 10 accounts, our at-once business and a strong start for our new Scarlett for women and Rider for men products.", "Wrangler saw strength in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. During the quarter, we launched an out-of-home marketing campaign across Poland, Germany and Italy that boosted region sell-through for our fall 2016 products.", "In Asia, Jeanswear revenue was up at low-single digit rate with a mid-single digit increase in Lee, moderated by a slight decline in the Wrangler business. Lee's online sales more than doubled, helped significantly by the Jade Fusion 2.0 launch. Jade Fusion also led to outstanding digital metrics and achieved a record high social engagement of almost 2 million followers in key Chinese markets. For the full year globally, there is no change to the expectation of mid-single digit revenue growth in Jeanswear. Now, to Imagewear.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Second quarter Imagewear revenue was up 3%, with our LSG business up mid-teens, offset by a mid-single digit decline in the Workwear business which, similar to Timberland and Wrangler, continue to be impacted by weakness in the energy-related sector. In LSG, Major League Baseball jersey demand was strong aided by continued success of the Cool Base replica jersey, as well as the addition of three new teams in the Japanese professional league. In the NBA, the Cavaliers' Championship delivered strong results for the license portfolio.", "On the Workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. Given that, we'll begin to lap this decline in the second half and we do expect this business to return to modest growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, globally there is no change to the expectation that Imagewear revenue will be up at a low-single digit rate.", "Our Sportswear business was down 19% in the quarter due to traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 20% due to the same challenges we've seen in the past few quarters, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel, our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business and traffic declines at outlet where we've closed seven stores this year.", "Kipling's North America business was down 16% also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3% driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific. Accordingly, we're now expecting a low-double digit decline in revenues for the full year for our Sportswear coalition. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Steve. On our last call, I spoke about VF's diverse business model and our consistent operational discipline. This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments. As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our contemporary brands coalition, greater visibility into bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business. Yet, even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver another year of earnings growth and shareholder value.", "So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion. By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%. Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear which continues to face very challenging conditions.", "By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 7%, with low-double digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter.", "By region, the Americas was up 1%, Europe up 3%, Asia up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter. Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product cost and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts.", "In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation. Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.", "Clicking down into profitability by coalition, on a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels.", "Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter, with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit revenue growth.", "Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG offset by weakness on the Workwear side of the business. And finally, in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same: challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness.", "So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be 90 days ago and overall where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discretes compared to last year.", "Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains that same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last two calls. Our inventory is in line with our second half growth projections. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million, so tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February.", "Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based on continuing operations, we now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single digit expectation. If you take a step back to gain perspective, this change is really about two main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at a mid-single digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high-single digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and revised outlook for Timberland based primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements while short-lived in nature do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low-single digit growth versus the previous high-single digit increase.", "The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low-double digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight declines. Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points reaching 48.7%. Now, keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher-than-VF-average gross margin, so when adjusted for this in continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%.", "Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5% which includes about 60 basis points of FX, so right around 15% for the full year excluding currency. Note that while the exclusion of contemporary brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin.", "With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year is now about 21% versus the previous about 23%, due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure. At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015. So even after adjusting for Contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February.", "For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with a low-single digit increase in the third quarter, followed by a high-single digit increase in the fourth quarter. With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low-teen percentage rate with a high-single digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year.", "So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year.", "Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management, from any angle, our model allows us to transcend short term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return, and more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long-term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength.", "And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail today. Very helpful. I just want to ask one quick Vans question, then I had a bigger picture question. On Vans, that was better than we thought in the second quarter given some of the trends. You guys had talked about pretty consistently that it was going to be back half story. But the guidance for the year was always partly based on things that were not in your direct control, there's some inventory from competitors out there in the U.S. with some of the data sources we see, we see other brands making big pushes on market share. Can you just talk to us about the second half and how you guys think about the competitive landscape for Vans and how much you bake that into the thinking for the improvement there?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Michael, this is Steve. I'll start with the Americas and K.H. maybe will want to add some things from an Asia standpoint. So we've called the year at high single digits and we're pretty much tracking right on plan, seeing great strength in our D2C, most notably e-commerce and then just good solid performance in wholesale. Second half, really don't see the changing dramatically. The strength of the brand continues. We talked about the power of our Classics collection with side stripes really performing extremely well and we've got new innovations with Classic Lights, our ISO program and then our Pro Classics where we brought some real performance attributes into the skate platform, we think will just continue to drive us towards the guidance that we put forward at the beginning of the year of up high-single digits.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "And, Michael, adding some color on the international side, starting with Asia. Asia is really doing well, as you heard me saying. It's doing well in DTC and wholesale, which gives us great confidence, no really big change. It's doing well in most Asian markets actually. Europe is a different picture. We reported that widely last time, Q1 was our worst quarter. Q2 is negative but better and we gradually plan to improve this going back to positive numbers in Q4. What gives us strong confidence also in Europe is our DTC numbers which are positive. That shows that the brand has resonated as well with consumers.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "And, Michael, I'd add real quick. We aren't seeing any changes in our wholesale orders due to competitors. And clearly, there's some competitors out there doing much better than they have historically, but from a Vans standpoint and our connection to our consumer, we stay right on track.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. You guys, I guess stepping back, you guys have always done a great job summarizing the big corporate goals for us and for the investors and for all the employees at the firm to focus on. It's been a while since we got the big goal of the long-term algorithm of 8% organic revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. But we've seen two headlines from you guys on dispositions this year. The end markets are in a different place than where they were when we first got the algorithm in 2013. So would you mind just helping us comment on how you think about those goals today and whether absent an acquisition how much more aggressive you could be with transforming the portfolio towards the highest performing businesses?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Michael. Eric. I'll take that question. Our organic growth rate goals remain intact. Clearly this year, we're off to a slower start given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. The most confidence inspiring part of this for me is that in our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have built into our long-term vision.", "Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business, the consumer take-out from our wholesalers isn't strong. What it says is that they have a lot of inventory and they're buying very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale next quarter and not a reflection of consumer engagement.", "So we still think we have the brand portfolio and we're doing the right things with our brands to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate, even this year which is clearly a pretty challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Right.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other, but we're committed to both.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks a lot, guys.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. So switching gears over to Timberland, by classification, where exactly are you seeing the inventory imbalance, whether it's footwear or apparel? And what gives you the confidence that this is a near-term issue and not something larger?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah. So this is Steve. I'll start this question. So the inventory imbalance we talked about is primarily Americas issue and we see it primarily in our boots category. It really started to see this at the beginning of early Q2, both in our wholesale and pro business and it's truly a short-term inventory balance because what we see is just a little bit of inventory sitting in our channels coming out of last fourth quarter. And similar to our Vans Europe business, it's not a product or brand issue. We feel really good about our brand metrics, as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or two getting that inventory to normalize. And why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sale through the first half that continue into the second half and that e-commerce growth rate of plus 25% continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way.", "So we see returning to growth in the second half low-single digit, mid-single digit despite we're coming up against a Q3 in 2015 where we grew over 40%. So that's, I would tell you, kind of frame up why we're positive is the brand continues strong. The sell-through rates are good. We just carried a little bit more inventory in the channels out of second half 2015 into first half that is normalizing now and will be clear as we come into Q3/Q4.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "Yeah, Matthew, I may be giving some international color starting with Europe. You heard me saying Europe is really strong. We're doing well in all channels. In wholesale, in DTC we have a new digital platform. We do well in most European countries, but we also do well in many categories of products. So it's a really good story there. Asia is a little bit different picture. We had planned a softer first semester and planned a stronger second semester. Remember, Q2 is our weakest quarter as well. So numbers are a little bit misleading. But specifically related to Hong Kong and Japan, but we expect Timberland going back to growth in Q3 and Q4.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just a follow-up on the larger picture model. As we think about the margin profile on the multi-year basis, has there been any change, it sounds like not through this year, but any change to the 50 basis points a year annual gross margin? It sounds like driven primarily by mix that's unchanged from the past. And then as we think about SG&A as a percentage of sales beyond this year, any reason to not think about that as more flattish going forward?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. So, Matthew, the first question is, really no change at all in our outlook for continued margin expansion. And that's really driven by mix. Even this year 50 basis points is what we've talked about for the full year and that's really driven by that mix. So we see no reason why that won't continue. As it relates to SG&A, we really haven't talked longer-term beyond this year. As you can see, we are investing in SG&A this year and, again, that's really, we think, a strength of our model to be able to deliver EPS growth and, at the same time, invest in D2C, innovation, product, those key strategic drivers that are going to set us up for growth in the future.", "Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Best of luck.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. I was hoping to follow up on your top line guidance for the year. Does it incorporate expectations for normal winter or colder than normal winter? Also, I think there were some comments in the prepared remarks that retailers are cautious regarding this winter. Is that a function of too much inventory or just weakness in the consumer?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. So I'll start that and maybe the guys will jump in. In general, while we're considering this a normal winter from our standpoint, it's worth noting that our wholesale partners have taken a very conservative view of the year, right? And maybe some of these imbalances that historically would have just been tolerated, we now see much more aggressive action from a retail standpoint. Thus, some of the issues that we've seen from our wholesale shipment side.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And I think just to follow that, the caution in our wholesale, retail community, we called that at the beginning of the year. We spoke a lot about how that's baked into our guidance. And what gives us real confidence about the power of our brands is the performance of our D2C growing high single digits this quarter and the strength of our e-commerce platform growing significantly. And as we expand our e-commerce platform to all of our largest brands, it's now moving internationally. Just again, it's a continued strength of how our brands are coming to life for our brands.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great. And then I wanted to follow up on the Outdoor & Action Sports double-digit increase and direct-to-consumer versus Sportswear mid-teen decline. Can you provide a bit \u2013 more color on how store comps performed in these two coalitions for the quarter and your expectations for comps for the balance of the year?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So our Outdoor & Action Sports D2C performance, I mentioned, is e-commerce. We're seeing just great strength there. And our store comps, which we don't talk directly about our brands specifically. We saw those in the flat to up just slightly, which is pretty consistent with what you hear across the board. Contrast that with Sportswear, over three quarters \u2013 well, the majority of our Sportswear retail footprint is outlet. And the outlet channel, as a broad comment, has seen a pretty significant impact in traffic due to the high promotional activity going on across the majority of retail here in the United States. So our Sportswear team has been specifically impacted just due to the heavy weighting of that outlet mix.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you. Best of luck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the excess inventory \u2013 the inventory growth year-over-year, you've called out about half of that is cold weather carryover product. Is that product that you're going to be redirecting to your outlet stores or your website? Or how are you going to work through that excess that's still on your balance sheet?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "No, Lindsay. That is good inventory that'll go \u2013 we have orders against it. That's first-quality good inventory. As we've said, we've been watching this now or talking about this for a couple quarters. We had two options. We could've disposed of it and re-bought it. We saw the demand coming in the back half of the year. We chose to hold that inventory and we see demand against it. So it's good quality inventory.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great. And maybe you guys could give some perspective on whether you saw any shift in consumer behavior in the UK or Europe post some of the negative events in those markets, whether it's Brexit or some of the attacks.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International", "I guess you heard me saying, Lindsay, we grew Europe 3%. Most of the brands are doing okay. It's not an easy environment, you're right. There's a lot going on. Specifically to Brexit, we have to see what is going to happen. Negotiation have started, so it's a long-term view. But all in all, actually, we are doing pretty well. Our DTC numbers are strong in Europe, so that shows that our brands resonate well with consumers.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. And just last one. Could you talk about how your business to off-price has trended?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "From a U.S. standpoint, we're pretty much normal percent to totals as we look at this year, nothing dramatically different whatsoever.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Hi, yes. Thanks. Good morning.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Wanted to see if you guys could maybe dive in a little bit deeper on the e-commerce business digital initiatives. And I know it's been growing nicely and I think you guys are maybe a little bit lower penetration than the broader kind of soft goods marketplace. You know what you're doing there and if you also have any thoughts around working with any new partners on the digital side, perhaps getting access to Amazon and the Prime customer base, if that's something that's \u2013 you're thinking about?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Right. So here within the U.S. business, I'll walk you through that. Our e-commerce businesses, obviously, has been and continues to be a big emphasis of ours. We put a lot of energy into building our VF platform that now all of our big brands, as well as additional brands are coming on to and we're expanding that into our European marketplace where our large global brands are able to really maximize the power of that content and then transact regionally in a very specific way. We have a digital lab that sits out in our San Francisco campus that is very connected to a lot of the fast-moving digital trends that we're constantly mining and bringing into that VF platform.", "And as we look at wholesale partners that we can work with, there's a whole host of really strong, pure plays in each of our businesses. There's the larger multinational partners that we have great business with, and then clearly Amazon is a good partner for many of our brands and one that we would continue to work with strategically as it fits into each one of our brands' strategies.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Omar, Scott here. Just cleaning up too maybe at the heart of your question that we're less than 5% our e-comm overall. We see a lot of opportunity there. It's high margin, our most profitable format. We've talked about in our long-range plans kind of mid-20s growth rate which is what we're seeing this year and we see a lot of runway on our e-comm.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And, Omar, this is Eric. One of the ways we're getting at that is through \u2013 we've been talking about this some over the last 18 months. We've built a new digital and e-commerce technology engine that we're rolling out across the world kind of one brand in one country at a time. I think in the last 14 months we've done 24 installations and we still have room to grow. And every time we put a brand up on this website \u2013 or I'm sorry \u2013 on this technology tool in the market, our e-commerce business gets better.", "To give you some context for how far we are, The North Face in Europe went live on Wednesday. So we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity. You're right, we are underdeveloped and we see that as a huge opportunity for us. And we know we have the right tool now, we're just rolling it out across the world and improving our ability to work with it.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Excellent. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask if there's anything new on the M&A front, Eric, that you want to add?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you for asking, but no. Sorry. Not trying to be cute, but I \u2013 we would never discuss any processes that we're part of, or not during a call. Thank you.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "So I guess the other side of the e-commerce question is the wholesale question. Obviously, there's been some challenges in the department stores and I guess the debate now is are these structural challenges or are they cyclical ones. The traffic trends that we've seen in the channel and the growth in your e-commerce partners in your own businesses, does that \u2013 does it fundamentally alter how you view your growth prospects in the wholesale channel for the longer-term? And how do you think about that?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it \u2013 look, we've been around long enough. The world is constantly shifting between different channels and structures. To put some context on it, because that VF has changed now, our composition with the exit from the, I guess, potential exit from the Contemporary Brands business, and department stores now represent about 3% of our revenue. Mid-tier represents about 4% of our revenue. We're much more weighted towards specialty and sporting goods and \u2013 but having said that, in all channels in our department \u2013 with our department store partners, we're working very hard to make sure we get more than our fair share of their big revenue numbers. There's still a lot of apparel and footwear sold and we're trying to be a great partner and get more than our fair share, and we do that across \u2013 with of course with all of our customers and it does go from year-to-year. There's different centers of concentration, but I know there's concern about our exposure and that's why I tried to get some context to the size of the business.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "That's great. Can you \u2013 Eric, would you care to share a little bit more detail on the coalitions in those exposures?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I can't do that. Even if I wanted to off the top of my head, I just don't have that information. I'm sorry. They're all \u2013 each has a different model and we're a global company with lots of brands. Scott wants to weigh-in.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "I'm just going to say we really haven't disclosed that level of detail. We just \u2013 we give you the overall percentages.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just another question is on The North Face. Of late during the past year or so, you were to \u2013 there have been some other entrants into the category at some higher price points. I'm curious to get your take on where do you see the opportunities to grow The North Face brand whether it's on the price point perspective if you have an ability to raise part of your premium offering within The North Face or if you see other opportunities to expand where you're currently \u2013 the base of consumers that you're currently speaking to.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Sure. The North Face continues to be the number one outdoor brand on a global basis by a long shot. You heard us talk at the beginning of the year that the team has recently gone through resetting the business around four specific consumer usage occasions or four new business units. Mountain sports which is that most technical expression of the brand, the mountain culture which is more the lifestyle aspect that would come out of that core mountain and into the city, we've got our Mountain Athletics or training category which is a fast-growing, very significant opportunity for both apparel and footwear. And then we have a new category that's coming out of our Asia business called Urban Exploration, marrying up with what's already a good city expression of the brand here and in Europe but bringing a really interesting Asian flair coming out of Japan and China.", "There, our team in Asia has been leading that will allow the brand to come at that city market in a slightly different perspective. We have the ability to sell higher price points and you absolutely will see us do that through these four new business units, but what you'll also see is real thoughtful line segmentation covering those key price points in those key categories for those channel partners that we do business with across the globe.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Is that something that we can expect to see this season or is that more of a fall 2017 expression?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "You'll start to see it come to life in fall 2016 but it will really come to life in 2017. If you happen to be in San Francisco anytime soon, our Palo Alto store which I mentioned in my comments as well as our Post Street store has just been re-merchandised around these four brand territories, and really it's a beautiful experiential expression of the brand.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Good luck, guys. All the best in the back half.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Kate.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about cotton. This we've noticed over the last week or so that cotton costs have gone up and I know it's only a week move or a couple of week move, but can you just remind us the timing of when you lock in your commodity costs? Is this something that you're watching and do you think it's sustainable and how we should think about it on gross margins going forward?", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Kate, Scott here. So well first of all, as it relates to 2016, at this point we're committed, right? So any movements that you see now are going to be in the future. We're generally two to three quarters out by the time it rolls into our results. What you see now would be a 2017 impact.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right. Okay. Okay. Do you have any view on cotton for the next six months? Is this something that is potentially sustainable, this increased cost? Or is it, are you watching it?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well of course, we're watching it all the time but we're not in the prognostication business as it relates to cotton. What we do is we lock in within the time of our lead times, and that allows us then to price and react accordingly. But in terms of trying to predict which way it's going, we haven't been very good at that. I don't know anybody that is.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then my second question was just about the reallocation of resources now that the Contemporary business has been sold and is going to close. Just how should we think about any kind of acceleration of potential investments or reallocation of resources as we get maybe into Q4 from this asset disposal?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Are you talking about capital or expense was your question?", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Both, if possible.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm glad I opened it up to both. Thank you. That's probably a good question to ask, a better question to ask after we have gotten closure on the strategic review we're doing at LSG because that's a big business and they affect our economic model. Scott mentioned that Contemporary has a little bit. Our gross margin will be a little bit weaker without it, but our operating margin will be a little bit higher. LSG would have another effect on it. We are obviously looking at the shape of the P&L, what it might be after this review is complete, and we might be able to answer that better later.", "Having said that, the economic, the P&L model will look different and we're trying to put ourselves in a position to accelerate the organic growth rate in our core brands and the two businesses that we're talking about selling will do that by math because they have not grown at the kind of rate that the rest of the business grows at consistently.", "From a capital standpoint, we're going to keep that powder dry until we see how much capital we have, but our priorities remain the same. First is acquisitions, and down the road, we'll be looking at dividends and share buyback. But our priority is acquisitions.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kate.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "See you, Kate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Good morning, everyone. As you think about pricing in back half of the year with the new product categories and given the fact that it is more fourth quarter heavy, what should we be looking to for each of the brands? Is there some new product, is there some new marketing initiative that we should be looking to for fourth quarter and potentially into next year as top-line drivers? Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, Dana, as it relates to price, we do have price. It will be a little back-half loaded. And we've talked about the FX impacts over the last couple years. We do have price, which more than offsets that FX in the back half.", "Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Got it. And then anything new on the product offering, whether it's in Timberland or Vans or North Face that we should be watching for with marketing to drive that business?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Well, our Vans business, as it celebrates its 50th anniversary, has been doing some really creative things certainly with the Nintendo collaboration. You will see some new ideas coming into the marketplace end of this month and early next month that I will leave for you to discover. It's not something we really want to talk about here on the call. But in the case of The North Face, we'll be really anchoring ourselves in these new brand territories that I've talked about, driving our Summit Series Collection which continues to evolve after its relaunch last year on a global basis and also driving Mountain Athletics and footwear.", "And in the case of Timberland, we will continue to drive our boots. The boot trend is still alive and well, and we've got some just great offerings along with our SensorFlex platform and, you know, that has been in place now for three years and continues to gain momentum and grab share not only here, but mostly we see it in our international markets.", "Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Hi, Jim", "Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'm particularly interested in commentary around channel inventories. You mentioned imbalances with Timberland and Vans Europe. Are there other notable pockets of imbalance? And then in contrast, what are the categories where you have healthier channel inventory positions and the stage seems better set to perform in the second half?", "Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director", "Yeah, Jim, this is Steve. The imbalance that \u2013 from a Timberland standpoint is, as I mentioned, boots, and it's across the dealer distribution that the brands work with. And it really is inventory that's been carried out of fourth quarter last year, and as they work through it with the strong sell-throughs we see in the first half, we'll return to growth in the second half. Otherwise, we don't see inventory issues other than what we've called out at the beginning of the year. Caution in especially outdoor, reflecting The North Face order book, but the rest of our business is sitting at a really strong place. Our new innovative products will have great opportunities to be placed in and be put in front of consumers.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Very good. And then, Eric, I'm sorry to do this, but with respect to acquisitions, I recognize it's a situation of preparedness meaning opportunity. We know you're prepared. So has it been just a matter of pricing that's holding things back? Or are you not seeing properties available that fit the strategy?", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say that there's two \u2013 it's a complicated answer because we're very, very active.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'm sure. Yeah.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "But the two biggest categories would be some of the properties that we're most interested in aren't available now, and some that we're interested in are not available at a price that we think is prudent to pay.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough and that does seem prudent. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.", "Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Thank you all for your interest in our company. It's been an interesting year for us. In the first half, as I said earlier, consumer engagement and purchasing of our brands in our stores and online is right in line with our long-term organic growth goals, and that gives us great confidence that our brands are strong and our teams are executing well. Unfortunately, our wholesale business growth is off, and that's following a very weak winter last year and all the implications of that on inventory in the channel. But that will get solved with time.", "With that, I'll just say that we're very confident about our outlook for the second half. We have good visibility and strong execution skills, and we look forward to giving you guys another update in 90 days. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's presentation.

Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the VF Corporation Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joe Alkire, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Joe Alkire - VF Corp.", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in adjusted and currency neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion, because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.", "You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.", "During the third quarter of 2016, we announced that we had completed the sale of our Contemporary Brands coalition. Accordingly, the operating results, assets and liabilities of the Contemporary Brands businesses were moved into discontinued operations, and results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.", "Joining me on today's call will be VF's Executive Chairman, Eric Wiseman; President and CEO, Steve Rendle, President of our international business, Karl Heinz Salzburger, and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Eric?", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. On January 1, after 21 years at VF and nine years as CEO, I moved into the role of Executive Chairman of the board. At the same time, Steve became our President and CEO. In light of our new roles and this transition, and consistent with how we worked together for years, Steve and I are going to tag team today's call. I'll provide an overview of our 2016 results, and Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott will provide you with greater detail about the year and the company's point of view as we move into 2017.", "So, here are the highlights of 2016. Revenue at $12 billion was up 1%, and importantly, the quality of our sales improved versus a year ago. Our international business remains strong, despite significant currency pressures, with international revenue up 6%, including double-digit growth in the non-U.S. Americas and in China. Our direct-to-consumer business continued its strong momentum, with growth of 9%, including more than 20% growth in e-commerce and double-digit increases in our Outdoor & Action Sports and international.", "Vans became VF's largest brand, as revenue growth around the world continued. For the full-year, Vans was up a solid 7%, with growth accelerating throughout the year, reaching 15% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin, a key measure for us, improved 120 basis points to 49.4%, including record fourth quarter performance. And in line with our expectations, earnings per share was up 7%.", "And while the environment in the U.S. was characterized by ongoing channel disruption in several high profile bankruptcies, VF's global business model and diverse brand portfolio enabled the company to deliver solid results during the year, including cash flow reaching $1.5 billion, returning $1.6 billion to shareholders, and demonstrating our operational excellence by keeping inventories in check.", "At VF, our fundamentals are strong and our ability to win with consumers is unchanged. And while segments of our wholesale business in North America struggled in 2016, our global direct-to-consumer business and our business outside the U.S. remained strong. We're taking steps to address our challenges in North America, while sustaining the global business model that will continue to create and deliver near and long-term value.", "Now before turning the call over to the team, I want to thank them for making my time in the CEO's chair everything I'd hoped it would be. While there are many things that I'm proud of, there's nothing I'm more proud of, we're confident in, in this leadership team. The company is in very capable hands.", "Steve, my friend, with that I literally turn it over to you.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Eric. It's clear that the pace of change in both our industry and the broader consumer landscape is happening at an accelerated rate. As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we will be an agile and consumer-centric organization. We will embed more of our value creating capabilities directly adjacent to our brands, while supporting cross-enterprise efforts with the right balance of brand-based and centralized teams and resources.", "Looking to 2017, we will focus on Vans, The North Face, and Timberland. We expect their collective growth rate will be in the high single-digit rate. We will demonstrate a special focus on reigniting growth in our North Face and Timberland brands in the Americas. And we expect that in 2017 international growth rates in Europe and Asia will nearly double, as we distort our capital investments toward our largest and most profitable growth opportunities, with a particular focus on China.", "In the months ahead, we will capitalize on and leverage our collective confidence in workwear across VF. This is a catalyst for growth as we see strengthening of the industrial sector and increased spending on infrastructure. Given our strong performance in e-commerce and to fuel accelerated growth, we will meaningfully invest in digital as part of our global focus on direct-to-consumer, and we will amplify our investments in the design of products to enrich the consumer brand experience.", "And to a question that is likely on your mind, yes, we remain committed to being an active brand portfolio manager, and we will continue to focus on M&A to create value. That being said, we will be disciplined and we will not take action simply for the sake of taking action. And, of course, the quality of our talent matters. We will leverage VF's deep bench of global talent by placing proven leaders in the right jobs, at the right time, in the right place.", "So with that, let's move to a more detailed discussion of our brands performance in 2016, first the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2% during the quarter, which was slightly below the outlook we provided last October. The shortfall was due in part to our strategic decision to ship less North Face product into the off-price channel in the Americas. While this decision came at the cost of reported revenue and earnings growth in 2016, we believe it was the right decision for the long-term health of our brand. As a result of these actions, coupled with retailer caution, channel inventories are well-positioned heading into 2017.", "During the quarter, our D2C and international platforms remained strong, with revenue growth in the mid-teens. Wholesale revenue decreased at a high single-digit rate, as low single-digit growth in our international business was more than offset by a mid-teen decline in the Americas, due primarily to the inventory actions just mentioned.", "Moving to our brands, I'll begin with The North Face. Global revenue was down 7% during the quarter, with a mid-teen increase in D2C, offset by more than a 20% decline in wholesale. And excluding the specific inventory actions we mentioned earlier and the impact of bankruptcies, global revenue would have increased at a low single-digit rate, with a significant improvement in the quality of sales.", "In the Americas, revenue was down at a low double-digit rate during the quarter, with a low double-digit D2C growth, offset by a 30% decline in wholesale, mostly due to the inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies previously mentioned. As many of you are aware, the fall/winter season got off to a slow start in October and November. Performance improved in December, and that trend has continued into January.", "I want to take a minute to explain the $80 million impairment charge to the lucy brand. This was a direct results of our decision to merge the lucy women's product engine with that of The North Face brand. During the course of 2017, we will wind down the operations of our lucy business, and beginning in 2018 lucy product will be positioned in The North Face brand as part of the Mountain Athletics collection.", "lucy has developed tremendous customer loyalty by delivering exceptional product in a very attractive consumer segment. However, brand awareness is low, the trademark is limited to North America, and the performance has been uneven over the last few years. We believe the combination of lucy's strong product portfolio with The North Face's brand awareness and distribution network is just the right catalyst to accelerate our TNF Mountain Athletics growth rate over the next several years. It's a great example of our One VF approach to active portfolio management.", "Now I'll pass it on to Karl Heinz, who will provide The North Face details in Europe and Asia.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.", "Our North Face business in Europe had another strong quarter, with revenue up at a high teen rate, driven by an almost 30% increase in DTC and a low double-digit increase in our wholesale business. Growth was balanced across geographies, channels, and product categories.", "The work the European team did two years ago to reset the model has put the brand on a strong path. We will apply those learnings to accelerate growth in the Americas. In Asia, fourth quarter revenue was down at a mid-single-digit rate. Our retail business had low double-digit growth, which was offset by more than 20% decline in wholesale.", "The quarter was weaker than expected, as the outdoor environment remained highly promotional in China. We are consolidating our retail partners, more aggressively managing inventory in the marketplace, and elevating our distribution in the region. While this shift will cause early 2017 performance to be relatively flat, we expect strong momentum to return in the second half of 2017.", "To wrap up The North Face, revenues for the year were down 1% globally in 2016 to $2.3 billion. Excluding the inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies, The North Face was up at a low single-digit rate. For 2017, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range, up mid-teens in Europe, and a mid-single-digit increase in the Americas and Asia.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Switching to Vans, VF's largest brand and our fastest growing brand in 2016 and during the fourth quarter, up 7% and 15%, respectively. It proved to be a terrific outcome, as we celebrated Vans' 50th anniversary year. The brand's continued success in a very inconsistent retail environment is impressive and clearly demonstrates the deep understanding the Vans team has of its consumer. Congratulations to the Vans team across the globe on a job really well done.", "For the quarter, Vans America's growth was balanced across the region and channels. Our strong momentum continued with 17% growth, including more than 20% growth in D2C and low single-digit growth in wholesale. D2C comps were up at a high teen rate, including 40% growth in our e-commerce business.", "Looking at product, our All Weather MTE collection, which is designed for the elements and leverages Vans as a four-season brand, doubled its revenue compared with last year. And Vans upgraded custom footwear platform, which allows consumers to create their own unique Vans shoes through patterns, colors and the ability to upload their own art, is off to a strong start.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.", "As expected, Vans European business returned to growth during the quarter and was up at a low single-digit rate. Our DTC business remains strong, with more than 20% revenue growth. Wholesale declined at a mid-single-digit rate, as inventory levels in the channel continued to moderate. We saw a significant increase in sell-through in our iconic silhouettes, and our Toy Story collaboration was a big success. Now that inventory levels have normalized, we expect high-single-digit growth in 2017 from Vans in Europe.", "In Asia, Vans revenue continued to impress, with more than 25% growth. This was fueled by almost 50% growth in DTC and a low teen increase in our wholesale business. E-commerce was particularly strong in China. Key product stories, such as the Toy Story collaboration, sold out almost immediately.", "In 2016, Vans global revenue was up 7% to $2.3 billion, exactly in line with our expectations. Looking at 2017, we expect Vans revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate, driven by a high single-digit increase in both the Americas and Europe, and up high teens in Asia.", "Now on to Timberland.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "For the quarter, Timberland global revenue increased at a mid-double-digit rate, which was squarely in line with our expectations. This result was driven by a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit growth in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas increased at a low single-digit rate, including a low double-digit increase in our D2C business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale.", "Similar to The North Face, our core brand business was impacted by a slow start to the season, excess inventory in the marketplace, bankruptcies and overall retailer caution. We were pleased to see momentum in our D2C business in Q4, our biggest quarter of the year, highlighted by continued traction with our new SensorFlex platform and limited release programs. Timberland PRO increased at a high single-digit rate, as we saw improvement in the industrial sector.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.", "Timberland revenue in Europe was strong, with revenue up at a low double-digit rate, with high teen growth in DTC and mid-single-digit growth in wholesale. DTC saw strength from SensorFlex, which doubled in size in the quarter. In our apparel category, we saw a 20% increase sparked by winter outerwear and sportswear collections. And finally, our Classic and six-inch boots sold in record numbers, driven by The Original Yellow Boot campaign, which celebrated Timberland's heritage.", "Revenue in Timberland's Asia business was up at a mid-single-digit rate, lifted by a high teen increase in our wholesale business. DTC declined at a mid-single-digit rate, as strong e-commerce growth was offset by softness in the Hong Kong and Japan markets.", "In 2016, Timberland revenue was up 1% globally to $1.8 billion, in line with expectations. As we look to 2017, we expect Timberland to grow in the low single-digit range, with mid-single-digit growth in Europe and Asia and modest growth in the Americas. And given the improvement in the U.S. industrial sector, we expect our Timberland PRO business to increase at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Now on to Jeanswear.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Our global Jeanswear business declined 4% during the quarter, as low single-digit growth for Wrangler was offset by a low double-digit decline for the Lee brand. On a global basis, low double-digit growth in D2C was more than offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale.", "In the Americas, Wrangler increased at a low single-digit rate, offset by a high-teen decline in Lee. Slower than expected traffic in the mass and mid-tier channels, combined with aggressive retail inventory management from key retail partners, drove softness during the quarter. Given market dynamics, we expect continued disruption and repositioning in these channels in the near-term, and we expect more moderate growth during the course of 2017. Our brands remain strong and we are focused on leveraging the growth opportunities in front of us.", "Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.", "In Europe, Jeanswear was up low single digits, with low double-digit growth in Lee, which was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler, primarily related to the timing of shipments. In Lee, the Scarlett for women and denim for men continue to be strong drivers. In Wrangler, the brand is showing positive momentum with new product initiatives, including our 70th anniversary Retro Glory capsule, a first-ever global collection.", "In Asia, Lee was about flat during the quarter and Wrangler declined at the high teen rate. Both Lee and Wrangler's results in the region were impacted by the uncertainty related to currency issues in India. We saw strength in China, in particular in e-commerce. Revenue for the women's business increased more than 25%, (17:46) BODY OPTIX.", "For the year Jeanswear revenue was in line with 2015, with low single-digit growth in Wrangler offset by a low single-digit decline in Lee. For 2017, given channel headwinds in the Americas, we expect Jeanswear revenue to be in line with 2016, as low single-digit growth in Europe and Asia is offset by a modest decline in the Americas.", "Now to Imagewear.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Imagewear revenue grew 15% during the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by a more than 20% increase in our licensed sports goods business and a mid-single-digit increase in workwear. LSG had a record year, thanks to the Cubs snapping their 108-year World Series drought and, as expected, workwear returned to growth this quarter, posting a mid-single-digit increase on the heels of improving industrial sector fundamentals.", "We are increasingly optimistic about the growth opportunity of VF's most capital-efficient business as we head into 2017. For the year, Imagewear increased 2% to $1.1 billion, in line with our outlook. For 2017, we expect revenue for the Imagewear coalition to increase at a low single-digit rate, driven by the workwear business.", "Our Sportswear business was down 17% in the quarter due to weakness in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 20%. However, adjusting for the strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 14%. The brand continues to grapple with significant pressure in the department store channel.", "Kipling's North America business was down 2% due to similar category and channel pressures. Kipling's international business was up 7% and globally the Kipling brand achieved mid-single-digit growth. For 2017, we're expecting revenue to decline at a high single-digit rate for this coalition, principally associated with the channel pressures faced by the Nautica brand.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Steve. Before I dive into the results, let me provide some context around the unusual items that impacted our fourth quarter. First, as outlined in the news release, we took an $80 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the lucy brand. This was a direct result of our decision to merge the lucy women's product engine with that of The North Face brand, as Steve mentioned earlier.", "During the fourth quarter, we also incurred $58 million of pre-tax restructuring charges. In light of the divestiture of Contemporary Brands, the ongoing strategic review of our LSG business, and the lucy initiative just mentioned, we are realigning our cost structure. In totality, these actions will allow us to operate with increased efficiency, speed and agility, and set the foundation for even greater leverage of our platforms going forward.", "Lastly, we elected to take a $51 million pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge during the quarter in order to reduce the size and volatility of our U.S. pension plan, which has been closed to new participants since 2005. The company offered former employees an option to receive a lump sum distribution of their vested benefits paid out of planned assets. This action reduced our total pension liability by $225 million. The pension was fully funded as of December 31, 2016.", "So now with that behind us, let's take a look at our fourth quarter results. I will focus on adjusted results excluding the unusual items just mentioned.", "Revenue was up 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.3 billion. While this was a little below expectations, the quality of the business has improved dramatically as compared to a year ago. We are acutely focused on the fundamentals. Gross margin is up. Cash flow is strong. Inventory is under control, up less than 1% versus last year. These facts give us confidence that the actions we're taking to improve and protect the long-term health of our brands, our channel, and our business model are beginning to show progress.", "Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 12%, including a mid-teen increase in the Outdoor & Action Sports and a low double-digit increase in Jeanswear. Our international D2C business was particularly strong, with a mid-teen increase during the quarter. Wholesale revenue was down at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter due primarily to inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies and difficult conditions in the Jeanswear business in North America. And on a geographic basis, the Americas was down 2%, EMEA up 7%, Asia was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in China.", "Gross margin on an adjusted basis was especially strong, 49.8%, up 160 basis points, which included a 90 basis point negative impact from changes in foreign currency. This was a record outcome for the quarter. Our gross margin drivers remain intact and, while inventory actions that we outlined cost us a little bit of revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, we are clearly benefiting at the gross margin line from the higher full price sell-through, as evidenced by almost 250 basis point increase in gross margin on a currency-neutral basis.", "SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 250 basis points on an adjusted basis to 34.5%. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment, we continue to distort investment toward our strategic priorities, digital and stores, product innovation, demand creation, and technology.", "Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin declined 90 basis points to 15.3%, the majority of which was due to a 60 basis point negative impact from FX. So now carrying all this to the bottom line, our adjusted EPS grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis to $0.97 in the quarter. That's in line with the outlook we provided in October after you consider the impact from FX, as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter.", "To recap the full year, 2016 grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 6% growth in our international business and 9% growth in D2C. This was despite the impact of bankruptcies and reduced sales to the off-price channel compared with 2015. These two actions alone accounted for almost 2% of top-line growth.", "Adjusted gross margin was up 40 basis points to 48.6%, including an 80 basis point headwind from changes in foreign currency. Our gross margin improvement was driven primarily by a 50 basis point benefit due to mix shift toward our highest margin businesses, as the expected benefit from lower product cost and price was essentially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.", "SG&A for the year was up 130 basis points, as we continue to balance appropriate short-term expense control with investments in our long-term growth priorities. Full year adjusted operating margin was 14%, compared to 14.9% in 2015, and includes a 50 basis point headwind from changes in FX.", "So that brings us to a full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.11, a 7% increase over 2015 on a currency-neutral basis. And we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to provide us with great flexibility. Our strong operational discipline was on display, as we ended the year with less than 1% inventory growth. In 2016, we generated almost $1.5 billion in cash from ops and returned more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "So now turning to 2017 outlook. We expect full year reported revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate, including about a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. By coalition, on a currency-neutral basis, Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a mid-single-digit rate, with Vans up low double digits, The North Face up mid-single digits, and Timberland up low single digits.", "Jeanswear revenue is expected to be about flat, with low single-digit growth in Wrangler and Lee international. Imagewear revenue is expected to increase at a low single-digit rate and Sportswear is expected to decline at a high single-digit rate. Building on a strong 2016 performance, we expect accelerated growth in the international business, up at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.", "By region, in Europe, we expect a high single-digit increase in revenue. In our Asia region, revenue should be up at a high single-digit percentage rate, including low double-digit growth in China. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we're expecting revenue to grow at a low teen percentage rate.", "Our D2C business is expected to be up at a high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. For the year, we expect to add approximately 50 stores. Comp sales growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range, including more than 25% growth in e-commerce. We expect our reported gross margin to approximate 2016 levels at about 48.6%. Changes in foreign currency are expected to negatively impact our gross margin rate by about 70 basis points. Excluding the impact of FX, our gross margin improvement is primarily mix related, as we anticipate a relatively stable product cost environment for the balance of 2017.", "Our operating margin is expected to remain relatively flat on a currency-neutral basis at approximately 14%, as our gross margin improvement is partially offset by continued investments in our strategic growth priorities, those being digital and stores, demand and product creation, and innovation. We expect our tax rate to be in the low 20% range. And moving to the bottom-line, we expect currency-neutral EPS to be up at a mid-single-digit range in 2017, or down at a low single-digit rate compared to 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.11.", "With respect to the first half outlook, we expect first half 2017 earnings per share to decline at a mid-single-digit rate on a reported basis, up low single digits currency-neutral. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2016 benefited from about $0.05 of earnings per share due to discrete tax items, the majority of which related to the early adoption of the accounting standard for equity compensation. We do not expect discrete tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017.", "So in closing, the structural shifts taking place in the retail environment are creating difficult conditions in some geographies and categories. While we expect these conditions to persist in the near-term, we believe our strong portfolio of brands, our operational discipline, and strength and diversity of our model, will allow us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. We look forward to laying out our long-term strategic and financial aspirations in more detail during the Investor Day on March 30.", "And now with that, I'll turn it back to the operator and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go first to Michael Binetti with UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Mike.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "First, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the model. The key one I'm wondering about is if second half of the year \u2013 thanks for the help with the shape of the year, but the second half of the year guidance is for revenues to accelerate about mid-single digits excluding currency. I mean, is that \u2013 how much \u2013 as you guys build that up, how much of that is based on the easier compares for the winter that we just came off of versus a more realistic view of your thoughts on the long-term run rate of revenues that the portfolio can deliver today?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, Michael, Scott here. So, I guess, first of all, it's true. Your modeling is \u2013 you're in the right ZIP code from the actual numerical growth in the second half. What we're seeing is acceleration, particularly in the big three, in the second half and that's based on our line of sight. Our top three brands are growing, as we look forward, high single digits collectively, and that's supported by the order books that we see. From the Jeanswear business we also will see some modest acceleration in the second half. As we're working through some of the repositioning in the first half, we'll see a return to growth in the second half. So those are the proof points that give us confidence in the second half that we'll see relatively better growth.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "And can it continue at that pace after we kind of roll off of the strange comparisons here in the second half of this year?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, are you talking beyond 2017? Or \u2013 yeah, I mean, we're confident in the growth, particularly in the big three going forward.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yeah, Michael, I would add just real quick. I mean, if you think about what we saw in 2016 and the compares that we have coming into 2017, we do see a much cleaner marketplace in that Outdoor segment. There was a tremendous amount of off-price goods, some fueled by ourselves and other industry brands, other portions coming out of the bankruptcies that the marketplace had to absorb. It's our opinion that those goods have been, for the most part, sold through and we have a much cleaner marketplace for ourselves to sell into. We also have a higher level of confidence on the product quality that we are selling into the marketplace with our big three brands, giving us great confidence that that collective high single-digit growth rate Scott mentioned will be there. And we see no reason why these big, powerful brands cannot continue at those rates with the additional focus that we're bringing to our product, the design, and the experiences that these brands bring to consumers.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And if I could just ask one last follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand the guidance for the year for overall is mid-single-digit revenue growth ex-currency, and then that translates to mid-single-digit EPS growth ex-currency.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Right.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "I'm a little surprised that mid-single-digit revenue growth doesn't translate to more leverage in your model, just based on some of the earmarks you gave us before and your comment that you're going to build about 50 stores next year, which is a little bit lower of a growth rate as we think through like the SG&A. Are there other components in the algorithm that have changed that a mid-single-digit revenue growth rate wouldn't translate to some leverage in the organic earnings growth rate?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, I guess, no, fundamentally. Michael, one thing, I guess, you heard too from a tax rate standpoint that we're seeing an increased tax rate. That's really couple reasons, but mix is driving a lot of that as we see the recovery of U.S. profitability. Obviously, that's at a higher tax rate and that creates a little bit of a headwind, but structurally, no change. The low single-digit revenue growth is also backed up by increased gross margin, as we see that mix benefit coming through.", "We are investing in the growth priorities from an SG&A standpoint, with digital and stores being one of those. Now we said 50 stores is the number of net adds. Keep in mind, we're investing against our biggest brands, where we have a proven profitable brick-and-mortar business. We are also pairing some of the underperforming stores, and particularly the actions related to lucy, as well as other parts of our fleet.", "I'd just point out, you look at our average lease term is a little over four years. That means, in any given year, about a quarter of our entire fleet can be adjusted. And as we've seen some tough performance in a few areas, we're taking advantage of that and we're paring down some of the underperforming stores as we look into 2017.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Look forward to see you guys in the end of March. Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Could you give us an update in terms of kind of your strategies to deal with some of the U.S. wholesale challenges that the whole market is experiencing? And how much you think \u2013 how you're kind of planning that channel long-term too? Is it kind of a slow, steady decline? Are you going to try to right size your footprint in those channels? And then how are you also thinking about digital marketplaces as alternative kind of wholesale channels, if you will? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yeah, hey, Omar. So when you think about the overall environment, certainly it's uneven and inconsistent. If I were to start, our international business is experiencing really solid growth. We came out of fourth quarter up 7%, and that is really outpacing the economic growth rates in both Europe and Asia. And we see that continuing into this year up high single digits. And our D2C, our own retail brick-and-mortar and our e-commerce had a really solid fourth quarter, up 12%; in particular, our e-commerce we saw plus 20%. And we see that continuing into the 2017 period as well.", "And the environment that we are really focused on here is the U.S. marketplace. It continues to experience channel disruption and, in some cases, channel compression. And we don't really see that changing. Our exposure to some of these \u2013 like the department store channel is less than 3%. And when you look at the mid-tier mass and department store together, it's less than 20%. These are important customers for us, and we are working with them to certainly improve our performance and, hopefully, in so doing, help improve their performance.", "But we'll continue to focus with our brand portfolio, especially these big three on our specialty channels and where our brands really come to life to where our consumers shop. And the digital piece is very, very important. Clearly, our own sites, but we have a whole host of online partners that we work with to represent our brand in the same manner that we do within our own sites, and we see that continuing to increase in importance, but also not at all discounting the importance of the brick-and-mortar experience that these brands of ours need to provide to the consumer.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. And then maybe could you talk a little bit in more detail? I mean, the D2C performances you mentioned was very good and it sounds like e-commerce was certainly a big piece of it. But what were some of the keys there or specific areas of strength that you think drove that channel, which is obviously especially important, given the wholesale channel's challenges?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "In case of D2C, our teams have applied a lot of emphasis around store productivity, and through product segmentation, certainly how we're using our stores as the premier expression, how that \u2013 then the product flows through our wholesale partners. But as we think about how we use our stores, being really thoughtful about regional assortments, using the data that we have through prior year's selling, putting the right product in those right locations, and really using our supply chain to optimize product flow and fulfillment.", "The in-store service component, the experience level, if you were to visit a Vans store anywhere in the U.S. or, for that matter, in the globe, I think you'd see a very consistent approach to how our brand comes to life, how the products were assorted, but most importantly, that service element that comes to life with our in-store staff, and that's been a big part of our performance this year.", "And then the digital piece, we've spoken a lot in the past about our One VF platform, where we've created a very robust content and commerce engine that many of our brands are on, and we use that to really drive that online experience, but also provide as seamless of an experience as possible and leveraging our supply chain to deliver those products in a quick and efficient way.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, Steve. Good luck, guys.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Omar.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Eric, congratulations. Good luck.", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I've got a couple of questions. I think the first one is just a bigger picture question I think for Steve. When you look at the profitability and the operating margin of the outdoor coalition, I think anchored by The North Face, can you just give us your take on how sustainable that level of profitability is for the business?", "And then the second question I have is on the Timberland business, can you talk a little bit about how the apparel business is performing at Timberland?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Absolutely, Bob. So the first question, the profitability of our Outdoor & Action Sports business, I will tell you that I think that profitability is absolutely sustainable, and that starts, first and foremost, with the quality of the products and the gross margin that we're able to obtain through just a year-over-year improvement of the products we offer and the pricing that we look to, to provide \u2013 to drive that gross margin.", "Levering our SG&A, making sure we're investing in those key areas, product, design, the marketing and the digital aspect takes great, great attention, and then being able to leverage really those back-end functions across the VF platform, really managing that model that we've talked about for years, really is bringing benefit. And when you think about the power of a Vans business with its D2C footprint, North Face with its D2C and digital platform, and Timberland really emerging and seeing better and better D2C improvement, that also gives us great confidence that that operating margin, profitability model is sustainable.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, Bob, Scott here. Just to add on, in the last several years too, we've had an incredible amount of FX headwinds, which have pressured us particularly in our European business. And while we do have pricing pressure and we've been able to overcome that over time, we see \u2013 typically when you see big FX impacts, like we have over the last two years, we grow into that over a couple seasons, right? So we're taking significant price increases, we have in the last two years and we will continue to. I would expect and we will see our profitability through gross margin continue to rise as we absorb those FX distortions. Think about Brexit alone last year was a significant impact in our largest UK market. We'll get over that, but it takes us a little while to price into that.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "And then I'll grab your Timberland apparel question, Bob. Our Timberland apparel business on a global basis is good. We've seen really strong growth in our European business. It was up 20% this last fall. We've been reshaping and repositioning our apparel engine to our Stabio, Switzerland, office and leveraging the strength of that sportswear platform anchored with Napapijri, and that's a large part what our Timberland team has been able to see those results in Europe.", "That collection is now coming globally and we need it, because here in the U.S. our performance has not been up to the expectations that we've had. We've seen good sell-through in our own retail environments, and we'd like to see better sell-through with our wholesale partners. And that is exactly why we've taken a step back, looked at how to really come to life with apparel as we see the success in our European business. That will become the global anchor for the apparel platform and we think that will really give us a point of difference, not only here in the U.S., but also in Asia, and be able to stand out against the other choices in the market.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. And if I could just have one more follow-up. On The North Face business, when you look at how the business and the brand performed in 2016, do you think that there's competitive challenges that the brand is facing today in the U.S. specifically?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "If you're going to unpack the TNF performance, we saw really strong international growth this last year. Our European business was up high teens in Q4 and for the full year. And I think another great validation point for us is our D2C is strong, and our e-commerce platform really represents the business well.", "I would tell you here in North America, Bob, probably the biggest issue that we saw in 2015 was that tremendous amount of excess inventory that was in the marketplace, and I said part of that was our doing. But it was the industry's doing coming out of 2015, had a really big impact on the marketplace and the ability to represent new goods with so much last year's product in the marketplace. That is exactly why we made the decision to pull back on the move of excess inventory at the expense of revenue and earnings, because we think it's very important that as a leader we do our part to have a clean marketplace for ourselves.", "I would tell you, Bob, some of this that we see with The North Face is our own doing. We, as we've looked ourselves in the mirror, do not think we've put the strongest product offer into the United States marketplace. And we've done a lot of work over the last six to eight months to rectify that and put ourselves in a better position. The four brand territories that these new specific business units that we have in place is adding greater clarity of focus and helping our design teams really bring the right product to life in each of those brand territories.", "And I guess the validation point, as we looked at our European business over the last two years, it's come from a similar slowdown. Tremendous amount of work done, first, on our leadership team, the market segmentation, and the quality of the product, the amount of new product that this team brought to market, combined with really strong go-to-market disciplines. That's brought us into that high teen growth rate, and that model, that template is being picked up and brought to our U.S. business, and I think this is where our strength's really come to bear. We'll be able to move quickly to get these changes in place and get that elevated level of product that certainly we've been used to and the marketplace expects back here in the U.S. market.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jim Duffy with Stifel.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Jim.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Eric, I wanted to thank you for your help with everything over the years. Congratulations to you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "Thanks a lot, Jim. It's been a pleasure.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Steve, my first question is a big picture question building on Omar's line of questioning on distribution channel strategy. So in North America, the landscape is dynamic as ever, good indications it's over-stored. Are there brands where you think it's the right decision to pull back on some distribution?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "I guess, if you think about the distribution strategy, that's a every season, every year opportunity for our businesses to look at the channel partners that they work with and how we are segmenting our products and really thinking about what partners to place our products in. I wouldn't say, Jim, there's anybody that we would back out of. I would say, each of our groups are focusing on their key partners, and that's true for Vans, that's at North Face, that's at Timberland, SmartWool. And I think probably more attention is being put into the right assortment, the right levels at the right times of the year, so really leveraging that retail discipline and becoming more retail centric looking at the quality of flow and the frequency of new delivery. I think that's more of our focus than pulling back on or limiting any of our partners.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, helpful. Thanks. In the Outdoor category, you're showing good discipline with respect to populating the off-price channel. We heard of order cancellations this year from many brands. What's your confidence that competitors are showing the same discipline to help with pricing integrity looking out to second half of 2017?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Jim, I can't speak for them, but all I can do is speak to ours. We have a history of really understanding how to supply the market in a \u2013 at a proper level. Those disciplines are back in a very strong and important way. And I think as we manage our own house effectively, we think that will really help us access that open-to-buy that we're deserving of and working with our partners, driving our sell-through and gross margin contribution to their business.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Jim, just to build on that, it doesn't directly answer your question, but one thing that we've seen throughout this year and expect it would continue is more conservative buying from the channel in general as well. So as you look back maybe into the end of 2015, where everybody got maybe a little over their skis and we had a glut of inventory in the market, we don't see that type of appetite as people are keeping it a little more cautious. So, again, we don't have full visibility to what everybody is doing, but in general there's more caution in the environment, which means \u2013 should mean less inventory in the system.", "Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, guys. I'll leave it at that.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Jim.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "See you, Jim.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on your outsized growth in the DTC business. Can you talk about a bit about the economics between the DTC and the wholesale businesses? Can you dissect the DTC contribution to the EBIT margin line? And how much variance is there to that line item, especially with the outsized growth in e-commerce?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, that's a lot of questions. So you can probably appreciate, we're not going to get into that kind of \u2013 that level of detail, but what I can tell you is that, first of all, our most profitable segment of our business is our digital e-commerce. And it's also our fastest growing, and that's where we're doubling down a lot of investment. We would expect that to continue to grow and even accelerate, as was part of our outlook. So that mix benefit will continue to help our profitability improve. Honestly, within our fleet, we have a bit of a bell curve, right? We have our biggest brands, which is where the majority of our retail sits, continues to perform very well. It's accretive, it has been and will continue to be a key strategic driver of our growth.", "We have some other formats that, frankly, aren't performing as well, and that's one of the reasons that 50-store net guidance is a little different than what you've seen in the past. It's about half of what we've done over the last \u2013 even a little less than half of what we've done over the last several years. And that's because we're focusing on those formats that work and leaning into those, and we're taking a little more cautious and aggressively reducing our exposure to those formats that don't work. And by formats, I'm talking about brands with relatively underperforming retail.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, very helpful. And then on the international business, it looks like you're going to continue seeing outsized growth in that business for 2017. I think it was 38% for 2016 in terms of revenues. How do we think about that business going forward as a percentage of total contribution? And then on Europe, I think Europe is still, like, twice the size of Asia, and then with the comments on China this morning, how do you think about the Asia business going forward?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So I'll give you some of the numbers. You must have an amazing model by the way, I got to tell you, that's impressive (52:52). We would expect our international growth to continue to outpace U.S., just because of some of the macro conditions, and frankly because we're so underpenetrated relative to the opportunities that we see, China being the biggest single example. So we'll talk more about that in 30 days or so at our Investor Day on how we see international, but suffice it to say, we continue to see it outpacing the overall growth and mix higher in the long-term.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Great, and looking forward to the Investor Day.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Laurent.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Lindsay.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Hey, Lindsay.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Steve, I wanted to start with, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the industry is going through an extraordinary pace of change and you're looking to adapt in areas that you're focusing on, included investing in your brands, direct-to-consumer and international, which \u2013 that was what I wrote down \u2013 which seems to have been the areas where you've been focused on for the last five or 10 years also. So I guess my question is, as you think about adapting to the new environment, what's really changing about your approach? Is there anything that we should expect that's really very different or where we should see more significant shifts or investment?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Well, we certainly look forward to spending a lot of time unpacking that question at our Investor Day. A lot of the conversation will be just around that. We spent a great amount of work over 2016 updating and refreshing our VF strategy, strategy that we'll talk to you about here in 30 days. But in that, Lindsay, it really was about how do we evolve what has been a very successful model. There's really no revolution to be had here. It's really about evolving those skill sets that we have here corporately, but more importantly make sure that fit in our brands in the most productive way. And as we think about going forward, our D2C capabilities really are an important aspect of our strategy and how we want to distort our energy in digital. That's not new news to you.", "We think we are very well advantaged with our platform that we use to interact with our consumers, but also as we stand up, stronger and stronger analytics practice to use the consumer data that we have and the shopper data that we're pulling out of our stores to help inform how we interact with our consumer, how we think about the products that we create, and when they want those products presented to them. Our innovation platform has been something we've been investing in quite a bit over the last few years, and that will continue to be an important part of where the new ideas for new franchises, but also we have a digital lab that sits in Northern California as well that really is keeping our teams and the businesses and our systems teams here in Greensboro really up-to-date and moving at the right pace to make sure that we've got the right technology in \u2013 really come in the front of us to be able to evolve and stay fresh.", "But I think the thing that we're really focused on here as we look at the disruption in the channels and, more importantly, how the consumers today are looking for brands to come to life to them is really elevating our emphasis on design. We've spent a lot of time and energy with some outside partners working with our top brands on elevating our design capability specifically for product, but how we link that product to our experiences, be it in store, online, or anywhere where our brands come to life. Vans is probably one of the best expression with their House of Vans or the different events that they have going across the globe. It's just how do we have the most robust design and the clearest expression of our brands that pull the consumers to us in this very cluttered and high-energy marketplace.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Shifting to costs, you have a restructuring charge, cost realignment charge that you took and I was curious if you could help maybe dimensionalize how you're thinking about cost savings in fiscal 2017 or beyond from that initiative? And also whether we should be looking for similar to 2016 savings from a favorable costing environment or maybe how you approach to pricing?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, Lindsay. So, first of all, the savings from the actions I think we said in our prepared remarks that, frankly, we're a little bit smaller, right? So we sold our Contemporary business. We're looking at options for LSG. And as part of that, we also took a look at our cost structure to right size that in light of it. So you can think about more or less the leave behind costs as you exit the unabsorbed overhead has been right sized in 2017, so that there's no impact from being a little bit smaller as a company. There will be continuing benefits into beyond 2017. We don't see the full impact of all those, but the majority of it really is just offsetting those leave behind costs.", "And I just make a general comment too. Continued cost hygiene is part of our culture and we'll continue to look at our cost structure going forward, because we see that as a no-regret action as a way to redeploy investment back into those strategic priorities that we've outlined before. I'm sorry. There was a part two \u2013 oh, you asked about cost, right? I assume product cost is...", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Product cost and pricing.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So we've got about 1% price assumption in our next year and we see some modest price increase, mostly around labor, labor costs and some of that's relative to the mix from a sourcing standpoint. But it's relatively modest, a little bit of commodity timing as well, but cost is really not a big issue as we look at 2017, and more or less the two balance out, price and cost.", "Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Lindsay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Eric, and best of luck.", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "Thanks a lot, Dana.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "As you think about the runway for gross margin gains go-forward, given the gross margin opportunity, how do you dimensionalize it either by coalition? And from what buckets does this gross margin improvement come from would you say? And lastly, any thoughts on the border taxes and how \u2013 adjustments there, how do you think about it? Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, hey, Dana. So, first of all, where does the gross margin mix come from? We've talked about this 40 to 50 basis points over for a very long time now, and it's pretty simple. It's our \u2013 high-margin businesses are our fastest growing. So it's D2C, it's international, it's Outdoor & Action Sports. We see no reason why that would \u2013 those would not continue to be our fastest growing businesses and they do indeed have our highest gross margin. So that's really the answer. Also as we've made some of the portfolio moves, that's also \u2013 that mix has also been beneficial from a gross margin standpoint.", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "And then, Dana, I'll take your tax and trade point there. I would tell you, we're very supportive of a reduction in U.S. corporate income tax rate, but we see some problems with trying to cover that gap with a border adjustment tax. We've sought counsel with third parties that we work with to really try to understand all the different elements of what's being proposed, and we've built a number of scenario models to help us understand those impacts. And we've taken that information and the approach that we're using here is to connect with key legislators and policymakers to help educate and influence their understanding of the impacts on our business, and through that create that relationship for the coming months.", "Because we're kind of at this point where we're going to monitor and observe, because honestly until there's a piece of legislation, there's really nothing to us to react to and it's more speculation. So it's really about understanding and paying very close attention, working with our advisors and doing this educate and influence approach with the key legislators and policymakers that we think is important for them to hear from businesses like ours on what are the issues and how would we frame it to have it be more optimal for business.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "And, Dana, I would just say, we can find scenarios at the extremes that are either really good or really bad. It depends on which tweet you happen to look at. But from our standpoint right now, we believe there's likely to be pros and cons, and it's virtually impossible to weigh what that would mean, given the fact that there's really no concrete legislation out there right now for us to model against.", "Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC", "Thank you.", "Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Dana.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. I guess, first on the Lee business in North America with the disruption that you're seeing, is that concentrated to one or two accounts? And then, when did you start to really see that unwind in the quarter and when should we start to kind of expect some stabilization in that business?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Erinn. Where we've seen the concentration of issues for our Lee brand is in the mid-tier channel, and it is most recently more gender-specific. Our men's business is performing really well and we've put a lot of time and energy over the last 12 months looking at the quality of the product, the fit, the function, the innovative materials that we're using. And as we placed those at retail, we've seen really strong results.", "Where we've really seen our issue and we're taking the same approach we have with our men's business for the last 12 months, is in our women's business. And we \u2013 a little bit \u2013 like I said in The North Face, need to look in the mirror and have we've done our very best to put the right product in the retail formats that we have available to us with our mid-tier partners to help them maximize their sell-through. So it's really localized to mid-tier and in the women's business.", "And I think the good news, if you can find the good news in a business that's seen this kind of impact, is we know exactly what to do and have deployed some new resources to our team in Kansas City to help really elevate and accelerate that product creation.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "So in terms of the turn, I mean, are you anticipating second half just based on how you shape the guidance for the year or do you think it's going to be more prolonged to get some of the product or company, or, I guess, execution issues improved?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yeah, no, I think that's a fair assumption, Erinn, is that we'll see sequential improvement as we go through the year, as we're able to quickly respond and then place this better product. Like I say, I would tell you, we've got a lot of great resources as we look across the globe. Our Lee business in Asia has been very, very successful the last three years. I think you've heard us say that we're the number one brand in China, and that's come from innovative materials and design, specifically in the female marketplace, and we're bringing a lot of those learnings to our teams here in the U.S. and applying that to the product creation cycle very quickly and partnering. Well, I think the key thing is partnering with our mid-tier retail partners specifically to get this product in place and on floor to begin to get that sell-through.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "And then one follow-up on The North Face. Are you guys looking at any new accounts from a distribution perspective to help offset some of the bankruptcy disruption in North America? And then where are you guys at with, I think, Todd's replacement for that brand? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Right. So I think, Erinn, for The North Face and if that's a U.S. specific question, it's probably less about new retail partners. I think we're well positioned today with where our brand is positioned, and yes, we've absorbed some pretty significant bankruptcies this last year. But every year our team is looking at their distribution strategy and really using that to inform the strategies that go back into these four new brand territories. And it's about really getting stronger presence of our Mountain Sports, our Mountain Athletics, more of our lifestyle collection, and then the Urban Exploration business that we have in Asia, bringing that across the globe. It's really looking at how to expand our footprint and use our distribution strategy more effectively to get these four consumer usage expressions into the marketplace, and at the same time looking to expand categories and maximize the penetration of each of those categories in these four-brand territories.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. And then just last on gross margin. I know there's been a couple questions on this, but just \u2013 what I'm trying to understand on a 70 basis points organic gross margin gain, you talked about that benefit being almost entirely mix. I think in the recent past you've talked about mix being closer to a 50 basis point benefit. So is this just the dynamic of the accelerating mechanics of wholesale being down, DTC being up? And then I guess with all of the challenges in the space, why not put some type of assumption for markdown dollar support in the guidance on the gross margin side? Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, so \u2013 I mean, it's really \u2013 I mean, mix is mix, right? So it's the acceleration of our strongest businesses with our highest gross margin. I mean, we talked about our international business being up significantly. We're almost doubling our growth rate in Europe and Asia, for example, right? Our e-comm is growing at 25% and we're seeing step improvements in The North Face and Timberland growth rates as well. So those are really the factors that are driving our mix as well as the quality of the sales, right?", "Our first quality sales continue to improve. We said it, but just to reiterate that, we walked some top and bottom line. We could've reported significantly higher sales and earnings in 2016, and even 2017, if we sell more in the off-price. We've made the strategic determination that's not good for our brand, that's not good for the channel. And that hurts us a little bit in the short term, those optics, but the quality of those sales, we believe, is sustainable and really the right place for us to be long-term.", "Now as it relates \u2013 I think part of your question was, should we put markdown dollars? Well, of course, we always have markdown dollars, but when you look at year-on-year, it's not significant in the gross margin walk. We also have price, cost. I mean there's a lot of factors in there, so I'm simplifying the walk for you a little bit. But if you boil it all down, essentially it's mix that's driving the gross margin improvement year-on-year.", "Yeah, can I build one more thing on that too? We also talked about the other side of that, which is the currency. I just want to reiterate how significant currency is in 2017. Just from a gross margin standpoint, it's 70 basis points. When we look overall from an earnings standpoint, there's almost $0.25 of EPS negative impact from currency in 2017. So the underlying currency-neutral growth rate is, obviously, accelerating significantly. But we have that significant headwind that we and every other global multinational has to deal with.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I know this has been asked a few times. So the outlook seems prudent in the first half, and then there's an assumed ramp towards the back half, which makes sense. But I guess my question is, can you be a little bit more specific about where the biggest deltas are by brand in the outdoor and active coalition? And I guess meaning, is it broad-based inflection you're baking in across all the brands or is it more weighted to specific areas?", "And then just the second question is, do you think you have more visibility this year versus 12 months ago, maybe due to DTC growth or international opportunities? And I only ask because it's almost exactly how you planned out 2016 to ramp as well, and clearly there were some issues that took place in 2016. So I'm just to trying to understand, has your visibility improved maybe relative to where we were a year ago? Thanks.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, I guess I'll start on that. So maybe starting at the end first, we \u2013 I would just reiterate the quality and the sound fundamental line of discussion that we've had. So we're exiting this year in a different place than we did a year ago, right? The marketplace is healthier; our business is healthier. And we're up against comps, frankly, that are kind of weak in the second half, right, as we saw some of the disruptions that we saw this year. So that's just a general comment.", "As we think about our businesses, we've mentioned throughout what's stronger in the second half. The European business for Vans accelerates in the second half. Just I hope it wasn't lost. We returned to growth in the fourth quarter in Vans Europe after several quarters of working through an inventory imbalance, and that business is roaring back, right? As we look going into next year, inventories are in line and we're going to see sequential acceleration throughout the year, and particular strength in the second half. And that's just been a \u2013 that's a great global story.", "The other probably notable one is The North Face will be relatively stronger in the second half, as again, we have a relatively better offer and we're also copying some of the actions that we took this year and you saw the decline. So I guess a little bit easier comp coupled with better execution and better product.", "Finally, our work business, again, we highlighted that throughout the call. We're really at an inflection point. This business is poised for a return to growth. We've seen this cycle, those of us who've been around here for a while. Our work business tends to be a nice leading indicator and we're starting to see evidence that the work cycle is up trending. Just as a point of view, our bulwark, our oil and gas related business has been under pressure for \u2013 gosh, I don't know \u2013 a year at least. But oil rig counts are up significantly, Steve, I think...", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "60%.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "60% year-on-year, and that's great evidence of what will be coming in the future in the work business.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's great. That's really helpful. Can you just also comment on North Face specifically first half versus back half? What's embedded in your outlook based on the bookings that you're seeing?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, we didn't give that level of detail. Just know that it's relatively stronger in the second half.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "All right. So in closing, before I close, I want to thank Eric for the leadership he's provided all of us at VF, for the focus and hard work that he's brought to the position of CEO and, for sure, the results in his wisdom and insights that have generated. Eric, I'm personally thankful for the time and energy that you've put into mentoring me over the years, and most specifically during this transition.", "I guess I'd like to reinforce just a couple points. Our big three brands will collectively grow high single digits in 2017, and you heard us talk a lot about continuing to invest in our largest opportunities, opportunities like international, workwear, and our digital and brick-and-mortar platforms. We are sharpening our focus on innovation and elevating our design capabilities to drive even stronger product and brand experiences, and we think that will be a significant differentiator in the years to come. We will continue to be very disciplined about our distribution and being very thoughtful around product creation for each of our distribution partners. And as always, we will remain committed to delivering shareholder value.", "So with that, I thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you or many of you at our Investor Day in Boston on March 30.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Joe Alkire - VF Corp.", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.", "Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominately in adjusted and currency neutral terms, which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion, because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.", "You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. VF's first quarter results were right in line with our expectations. Our growth engines continue to deliver solid results, despite a retail backdrop that continues to experience disruption and consolidation, particularly here in the United States.", "Overall revenue was down 1% during the quarter, but this doesn't tell the whole story. The momentum we see building in our largest brands and in our international and direct-to-consumer platforms is strong. And our first quarter results give me confidence in our expectation for accelerated growth as we move through 2017.", "For the quarter Vans, The North Face, and Timberland grew at a combined rate of 4% with strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7% respectively. Our international business grew 5%, and our China business delivered an impressive 10% growth rate. Direct-to-consumer grew 7%, including a mid-single digit comp. And our digital business was up more than 25%. We're really pleased with this solid performance.", "Operational discipline and sharp focus on fundamentals led to a 190 basis point improvement in our gross margin during the quarter. Our gross margin drivers remain intact. And our strong margin expansion will fuel investment in our strategic priorities and provide flexibility as we execute against our 2021 plan. It's an important and sustainable part of our model.", "EPS was down 3% to $0.52 in the first quarter. That being said, know that our earnings growth was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to a higher tax rate. That means that our EPS growth would've been 5% excluding the tax headwind. Scott will cover this in more detail later in the call.", "One of the core pillars of our strategy is to reshape our portfolio. We've shared with you in detail the strategic and financial filters we use to evaluate our existing portfolio and also our acquisition pipeline.", "In early April we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our LSG business to Fanatics. This announcement is another example of our work as active portfolio managers and our intention to move faster. On a personal note the LSG and JanSport collegiate employees have been part of the VF family for many years, and I thank them for their service and wish them all continued success.", "Pace of change in our industry and the broader consumer landscape is accelerating. The choices and capabilities embedded in our 2021 strategic growth plan positions us to win and will serve as a catalyst for VF's accelerated growth. We will become a more agile and consumer centric organization. We will reshape our portfolio. And we are a diversified value creation company.", "So with that let's dive into our first quarter results and look at our top five brands and Workwear.", "Starting with The North Face. Global revenue was up 8% with strength in the Americas and Europe offset by a slight decline in Asia-Pacific, which we did expect. Excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas business, which didn't really impact us until the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North Face was up at a low double digit rate. Our revenue growth during the quarter was balanced with low double digit growth in D2C and mid-single digit growth in wholesale.", "By region, Americas grew 4%, driven by low teen growth in D2C with strong results from e-commerce, which grew nearly 20%. This was offset by a low single digit decrease in wholesale due to the impact of the bankruptcies. From a product standpoint, rainwear performed well in the quarter, driven by the launch of our new Apex Flex Gore-Tex jacket, which provides comfort and protection coupled with a new fit and aesthetic.", "In Europe, The North Face was up 19% as its strong momentum continued. The wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 30%. The business remains well-balanced with strong results across all product categories and channels, which we expect to continue for the balance of the year.", "In Asia, as expected, first quarter revenue was down 1%, as low double digit growth in D2C was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. As the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace. We continue to expect high single digit growth in 2017, primarily weighted toward the second half.", "While revenue growth at The North Face was slightly above our expectations for the first quarter, there's no change to our outlook for mid-single digit revenue growth for the brand in 2017.", "Now switching to Vans. Global revenue was up 7% with broad based growth across all regions of the world and all product franchises. From a channel perspective, D2C increased at a high teen rate, while wholesale was flat, as growth in the Americas and Asia was offset by an expected decline in Europe.", "Vans Americas business was up 6%, driven by low double digit D2C growth, including more than 20% growth in e-commerce. The wholesale business increased at a low single digit rate. As you'd expect our wide range of product continues to resonate with consumers, with Classics and particularly the Old Skool fueling success in D2C and wholesale.", "And building on our commitment to deep consumer connectivity, the brand opened a permanent House of Vans in Chicago, a pop-up House of Vans in Toronto, and three pop-up House of Vans locations in Mexico.", "In Europe, the Vans turnaround story continues to take hold with 1% growth during the quarter. Our D2C business remains strong, with 20% growth driven by a 30% increase in e-commerce and a high-teen comp growth. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single digit rate. With inventory levels in the channel now normalizing and double digit growth in our fall order book, we're on track to deliver high single digit growth in Europe in 2017.", "In Asia, for the third consecutive quarter Vans delivered more than 20% growth. This was fueled by more than 50% growth in D2C with strength across all markets driven by exceptional growth in the digital space in China. Wholesale increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in China and Korea. Looking to 2017, we are confident in our low double digit growth outlook for the Vans brand.", "In line with our expectations Timberland global revenue decreased 4% with low single digit growth in D2C and high single digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas decreased 7%, as mid-single digit growth in our D2C business, including almost 30% growth in e-commerce, was offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale.", "We continue to work on diversifying our business toward a more balanced assortment, which will reduce our reliance on Classic boots in the Americas region. This is the strategy we outlined at the Investor Day, and it's the same successful strategy that has led to more consistent balanced growth in our international business.", "While not yet to scale in the Americas, we are seeing tremendous success in our men's casual platforms, such as SensorFlex and AeroCore. Our D2C business has the right assortment. And the growth we are seeing gives us confidence that we have the right strategy.", "However, the product transition in the wholesale channel will take a little longer to play out. As we diversify the assortment, and our retail partners work through inventory in the boot category, we expect the Americas business to return to growth in the second half of 2017.", "Timberland revenue in Europe was in line with 2016 levels, as low single digit growth in D2C was offset by flat revenue in wholesale. As expected, wholesale revenue in the quarter was impacted by timing of shipments in our distributor business. We expect Timberland Europe to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate into the high single digit range in the second half of 2017, supported by the order book, which is now fully allocated.", "Revenue in Timberland's Asia business was down 5%. D2C declined a mid-single digit rate, as strong e-commerce growth in China and low single digit comp growth was offset by our decision to reduce underperforming doors in some of our mature markets. Wholesale was down at a high single digit rate.", "For 2017 we continue to expect Timberland to grow in the low single digit range. We expect the brand to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, as our international business gains momentum, and we continue to evolve our product segmentation and assortment in the Americas.", "Looking at Wrangler, global revenue for the first quarter was down 9% with low double digit growth in D2C more than offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region a low teen revenue decline in the U.S. offset high teen growth in our non-U.S. Americas business. And revenue in Europe and Asia declined at a low single digit rate for the quarter.", "As we've discussed, our U.S. business has been impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and continued channel consolidation. These actions will affect our business primarily in the first half and growth should return by year end. We're working closely with our key retail partners. But our visibility regarding timing is low and the variability is hard to predict.", "While quarter-to-quarter forecasting will be difficult, our past experience tells us several things that we can expect once the repositioning is complete. First, strong brands like Wrangler will command even stronger positions, as smaller brands are edited out. And second, superior supply chain and replenishment capabilities give us an advantaged position.", "Regarding product, this week we announced that we are expanding our offerings for the spring season with a men's collection that is built for the outdoors. The Wrangler Outdoor line incorporates multifunctional features ideal for the outdoor enthusiast. Made of performance materials that keep the wearer cool, dry, and comfortable, these products also feature UPF 30 to protect the consumer from the sun. This is a perfect example of our efforts to transform Wrangler into more of a lifestyle brand, while keeping it connected to its heritage and its loyal consumer.", "Switching to Lee, revenue declined 6% during the quarter with mid-teen growth in D2C offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. Low single digit growth in Europe, Asia, and our non-U.S. Americas business was offset by a low double digit decline in the U.S.", "BODY OPTIX continues to perform well in Asia, comprising about 25% of our women's business. We plan to bring this to Europe and to North America later this fall.", "In the U.S. our men's business continues to deliver solid growth, as X-Treme Comfort Khakis and Extreme Motion denim continue to resonate with the Lee consumer. However, ongoing channel weakness and challenging conditions in our women's business are impacting results. For 2017, we continue to expect Jeanswear revenue to be in line with 2016 levels.", "And finally, I'd like to highlight Workwear, the business we recently presented as a new growth platform for VF. Workwear, which includes our Image business as well as Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear, increased 1% during the quarter. Our Image business was negatively impacted by the timing of a government contract between Q4 and Q1 and declined 5%. However, our largest brands within Workwear were strong, as the recovery in the industrial sector continues.", "Timberland PRO grew 15%, Bulwark was up 17%, and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear increased 13%. Given our expectation for accelerated growth through the balance of 2017 and the inherent profitability of this business, we are even more optimistic about the Workwear opportunity.", "And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Steve. Before I cover the first quarter in detail, let me provide a few comments regarding the LSG transaction and how it impacted our first quarter results relative to the outlook we provided in February.", "As you know, in early April we announced that we had reached an agreement with Fanatics to sell our LSG business. The sale price is about $225 million pre-tax, subject to working capital and other adjustments. And we expect to close this transaction very shortly.", "In conjunction with the sale of LSG we are also exiting the Licensing business of JanSport collegiate. Accordingly, the results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued ops, and the prior periods have been adjusted.", "In 2016 these businesses contributed about $575 million of revenue and roughly $0.13 of EPS. We provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding the Licensing business, so you can see the full impact.", "Relative to the first quarter of 2017, before restructuring and other charges triggered by the transaction, these businesses contributed about $0.03 of EPS during the quarter. So relative to the outlook we provided in February, our LSG and JanSport collegiate businesses contributed about $130 million of revenue. And our continuing operations EPS of $0.52 would've been $0.55 on a like-for-like basis.", "So with that out of the way, let's review the first quarter results. In line with our expectations, revenue was down 1% on a currency neutral basis to $2.6 billion. Our growth engines delivered solid results in the quarter. Our big three brands were up 4% on a combined basis with particular strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7%, respectively. And as the industrial recovery continues to evolve, Bulwark, Timberland PRO, and Wrangler RIGGS grew at a mid-teen rate.", "Our international business grew 5%, and China remained particularly strong with 10% growth. And our Direct to Consumer business was up 7% in the quarter, including more than 25% growth in our Digital business. Now to unpack our Direct to Consumer results a little further, our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved low double digit growth during the quarter.", "Wholesale revenue was down 4% due to a key customer's inventory action in our Jeanswear North American business, the impact of bankruptcies in Outdoor & Action Sports, and difficult conditions in the department store channel, which continue to pressure our Sportswear businesses. In contrast, our international wholesale delivered low single digit growth, and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a combined rate in the mid-teens.", "I want to take a few minutes to provide more context around our outlook for the Jeanswear business in 2017. There is no change to our outlook of about flat revenue for the year. Our international business remains solid, with particular strength in Europe and Asia, where we expect low to mid-single digit growth this year. We continue to expect our business in North America to decline at a low single digit rate, as a result of the previously mentioned inventory destocking. This impact will primarily be in the first half.", "Now, despite the short-term noise, it's important to keep focused on the end game. We are confident that our Jeanswear brands are strong and our superior supply chain places us in an advantaged position, once the process is complete. However, our visibility regarding timing is low. Therefore, the quarter to quarter variability will be hard to predict.", "Gross margin remained strong at 50.2%, up 150 basis points on a reported basis, which included a 40 basis point negative impact for FX. That's a 190-basis-point increase on a currency-neutral basis. As we mentioned in February, we are sharply focused on fundamentals and willing to sacrifice a little growth in the near term for quality. Our efforts are clearly paying off in the gross margin line. And we believe our decisions will improve the long-term health of both our brands and the marketplace.", "SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 200 basis points to 38.9%. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment, we continue to invest in strategic priorities, D2C, and in particular, digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, while our overall SG&A expense was up just 3%, investments and strategic priorities accounted for more than all of that increase, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.", "And as our growth accelerates in the second half and we begin to realize the full benefits of our agility and optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in our SG&A ratio in the second half and into 2018.", "First quarter operating margin declined 50 basis points to 11.3%, primarily as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency. On a currency neutral basis our operating margin during the quarter was down 10 basis points to 11.7%.", "So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS declined 3% on a currency neutral basis to $0.52 in the quarter. However, our EPS rate was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to lower discrete tax benefits, primarily as a result of the adoption of the equity comp accounting standard last year. Excluding the discrete tax impact, EPS on a currency neutral basis was up at a mid-single digit rate.", "Turning to our balance sheet. Our inventory increased 2%. And as promised, we continued to return capital to shareholders, as we repurchased about $440 million of stock. As we announced in March, our board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program to support the capital allocation priorities we laid out in our 2021 plan.", "As we look to the balance of 2017, we are updating our outlook to incorporate the sale of the Licensing business. Reported revenue is still expected to be up at a low single digit rate, including about a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. However, this is off an adjusted 2016 base to reflect the sale of LSG. We expect gross margin to improve about 20 basis points to 49.6%, which includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX.", "Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis, including about a 60 basis point negative impact from FX.", "Currency neutral EPS is still expected to be up at a mid-single digit rate in 2017 or down at a low single digit rate compared to 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.98.", "While there is no change to our currency neutral revenue and EPS outlook for the full year, I'd like to make a few comments relative to the first outlook \u2013 first half outlook we provided in February.", "First, our Licensing business contributed about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS per quarter during 2016, so that should help you think about your models. Second, as we mentioned, our visibility in Jeanswear North America is low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is hard to predict right now. While there is no change to our annual outlook for Jeanswear, it's hard to predict which side of the Q2/Q3 quarter break orders may fall. As a result, were providing an EPS outlook in a range of $0.27 to $0.30 for the second quarter.", "So in closing, the first quarter of our 2021 strategic plan played out as expected. We are confident in our mid-single digit earnings growth outlook for 2017 and in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half. We are focused on fundamentals and becoming a more agile and retail centric organization. And we are committed to becoming a more active portfolio manager, while delivering top-quartile TSR through our diversified model. We are a value creation company.", "And with that I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we'll open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the 4% decline in the wholesale business. I think in the prepared remarks I think it was noted that it was primarily due to a key U.S. customer. Any sense what the wholesale business would've looked like if we strip out that customer?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, you're right, Laurent. It was driven by the U.S. customer, particularly in our Jeans business. But we also called out our Sportswear business was a little tough in the quarter as well. So I think if you stripped those out, really if you look, our \u2013 we did see growth in our larger brands as well as our international business. And also importantly our digital accounts as well, we saw mid-teen growth.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. Very helpful. And then on international revenues I wanted to follow up on last quarter's guide that Europe and Asia would both grow at a high single digit rate for the year. In light of the first quarter results for those regions can you possibly walk us through how we should think about those regions? How they'll grow in the first half versus the second half?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, I think I'll start with Europe. We are seeing \u2013 the largest acceleration in the second half will be in our Vans business. This has been a really great story over the last several quarters, where we've seen sequential improvement. In fact we returned to growth, although it was modest, in the first quarter.", "But based on the order book we see going forward, we're seeing double digit positive order books in Europe. And that's going to be a big driver. That has been a big driver consistently in our Europe business. And we're really excited to see that come roaring back, because that's also a very profitable business. As CFO I like that.", "Also on the second half our digital business, our e-comm, is where we see the majority of that. It's more second half weighted. And based on the trends, while the trends won't necessarily get larger as a percentage, the absolute amount of business is larger, as well as the openings that we've had from a D2C standpoint in the first half, as those start to pay off in the second half. So generally, that's the trend we see in both regions, which gives us confidence. Steve?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "And, Laurent, I would just add a little bit there. I mean clearly it is the return of strong growth with our Vans business. I mentioned we have a very strong back half order book.", "But it's also the continued growth and the high level performance from our North Face brand in Europe. Our Timberland brand comes back to very strong growth as we see our expanded apparel offer, a stronger women's offer coming into the second half.", "But we also \u2013 it's the strength of our Vans brand in Asia that continues to drive that strong double digit growth and gives us confidence in that back half growth.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "More than 20% growth in Asia, right?", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Very helpful. Best of luck.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Binetti of UBS.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Morning, Michael.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "I just wanted to ask a couple modeling things really quickly. On the FX we've seen that \u2013 it's been pretty volatile here recently. I was actually a little surprised to see that it was still just a 2% estimate in your \u2013 the way that you're modeling it for the year on the impact to revenue for the year. Is that \u2013 I mean is that \u2013 would you mind helping us with how you're pegging the euro or maybe the pound on that? Just so we understand what you're looking at in case things change more through this quarter, which obviously they could, tend to be volatile.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Sure, Michael. So we looked at the last 90 days basically average and that's essentially what we've \u2013 for all our basket of currencies. And yeah, some of them are positive like the euro and others not as much. But what we've done is we've looked about at the last 90 days and gone \u2013 projected that going forward.", "So if the currencies, if the dollar continues to weaken, could that be a tailwind for us? Yeah, it could. But based on what we're seeing right now in our forward projections, we're not counting on that trend continuing. And it's slightly beneficial, but it's not material to the overall results.", "The other thing I'd just remind everybody is about 80% of our transactional exposure is hedged. So from an in-country profitability standpoint, there is some variability, but not a lot.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Right. And then I think just you mentioned something I think around Timberland. But I was surprised to see it looks like only about four net new store openings in the quarter versus last quarter. It sounded like you had a couple closures, though.", "Maybe we could get a little bit of context behind how you're thinking about the seasonality of the store openings this year. Because I think if we just look at some of the longer term run rates you gave us at the Analyst Day, it looks like that you'd be opening at a lot faster pace than what you reported in the first quarter.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yes. Maybe I'll start there. So one of the things that we said, Michael, is that we're going to take a hard look at the productivity of our stores and profitability. And in Asia and in particular, we have a large business in some of the more mature markets like Japan there. Where frankly, we've struggled a bit. And we've taken a step back from a store footprint there based on productivity.", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I guess just one last one. I think you had a \u2013 for North Face you had a competitor I guess this week talking about a little bit more of a cautious outlook for the U.S. on orders through the year, which is unusual from the standpoint of the first quarter, taking a more cautious outlook for the year. Can you just talk about your North Face outlook in the Americas? Obviously the Europe numbers are great. But for the Americas this year, what gives you confident in the order book you have today? And how much variability there is around those numbers if things change through the year?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Sure. I'll grab that one, Michael. As you heard, we reaffirmed our mid-single digit growth outlook for the year. Really happy with our first quarter results, as we came through the colder January, February. And then the launch of some new products here at the back half of Q1.", "I think the key here is, as we came through last year and the decisions that we made to clean up the marketplace and focus on, first, quality sales, the orders that we have in hand are really driven against the sell-through we saw last year and very thoughtful growth rates across each of the wholesale partners that we have.", "There's some new products coming in our higher end Summit Series, some new ski and snowboard styles that are giving us confidence with that wholesale distribution.", "But I think the key here also is our D2C is performing really well. And we see our digital platform driving strong growth. And certainly that's the higher quality product offer, but it's also the impact of a cleaner marketplace and not having to compete with a large amount of off-priced goods, some ours, some others. But I think that all of that kind of aggregate gives us confidence against that mid-single digit outlook that we just reaffirmed", "Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Good morning.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Just a question. I wanted to focus on Timberland in the U.S. So I'm just trying to look at the numbers. And D2C is up mid-singles, so it looks like with the current product you have, things look good. And the wholesale channel is down low double digits. So just kind of curious if you could contextualize it. How much of it is just a channel inventory issue, and you just need that to get kind of cleaned up, versus the current product pipeline performance?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So I think you've characterized it really well. We talked at the Investor Day, and I think we really see that continuing right now is our \u2013 a little bit more dependent on boots here in the U.S. than we see in other parts of the world, specifically Europe. And a lot of work going on right now to work on product segmentation and really leveling the different franchises that sit within each of the different channel partners.", "We are moving through some boot inventory, as we place our SensorFlex and AeroCore franchises at a better rate. But where we are able to get that front and center is in our own D2C. And that is where we're seeing really strong reactions. And in our e-commerce platform where we were up 30%.", "So it's really moving through inventory. It's getting \u2013 really creating the space to place these new franchises and using the proof points that we see in our own D2C here in the U.S. But also the performance that we've seen in our European platform in taking those learnings back here to our domestic market.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. And if I could, Scott, one more for you on the Jeanswear side. I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So on one hand it sounds like you're saying you think the Jeanswear business could begin to improve in the back half of this year. But I thought you were \u2013 you discussed at the Analyst Day that you didn't really expect the pressure in that segment to abate until early 2019. And that's why you thought the business would start to inflect more on the top line at that point.", "Can you help me just kind of understand? I mean I know you don't have a lot of visibility, given what's going on there right now.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. Yeah.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "But just how do I take those two comments and think about them?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So first of all, as you think about the pace of the year, we're going to see sequential improvement as the year progresses. And if you think about it just kind of big picture, you got a destocking that's occurring through the first half, which is again one of the reasons we talked about the variability and lack of visibility, is we don't fully control the timing of how markdowns and floors are cleared and all that. That's our customers' decision, right? Not ours.", "But we know where we're going to end up at the end. And at the end of the year \u2013 by the end of the year we should, according to their plans, be through the destocking phase and getting into the new floor set by the end of the year. We have visibility to what programs we have. We know what the expectations are. But the way this is laying out is a narrower assortment with higher velocity. And again, these are a lot of assumptions.", "So we should see that higher velocity start to pay off in the second half. And that's what I meant by the acceleration by the end of the year.", "Now if you zoom out a click and go back to the Investor Day, we know that there are a number of factors in that channel of distribution which cause variability. One of those is the repositioning of a major customer. There's other customers that have been closing doors. And there's other disruptions that are occurring.", "So my comments at the Investor Day were more of a broader picture, to say that while quarter to quarter we could see some disruption and choppiness, if you keep the end game in mind and think about the big picture here, we really like where we're going to end up once all this plays out. Right?", "That is, we own the strongest brand in that category with the Wrangler brand. We know that in a narrower assortment, big brands win. And there's more focus on replenishment and quick supply chain capabilities. That plays right into our strengths.", "So, one of those comments is more tactical. Just it's going to be really hard quarter to quarter to thread the needle exactly on what we expect. But we know where the end game is. And the other is, if you keep your eye on the prize here, we like strategically where we're going to end up in the jeans section, given what we believe are some core advantages, strength of brand and strength of supply chain.", "Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks for taking my question.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Morning, Omar.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Morning. Wanted to talk to you about kind of a dichotomy between the U.S. trends in the business here versus in Europe and Asia, where there seems to be a growing kind of separation.", "Do you feel like that some of the challenges in the U.S. and the wholesale channel and promotionality going on over here, do you feel like these issues are going to stay confined to the American market, the North American market? And there's \u2013 Europe and Asia are structurally different industries and those challenges can be avoided in those markets? Or do you think they eventually flow globally, kind of from an industry level?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "I'll try to answer that question, Omar. Some of that is looking at a crystal ball. But what I would say, what we see in our international business, where really things are not necessarily that much easier, our brands are doing extremely well. The thoughtful approach to segmentation and really placing the right product collections in each of these distribution channel partners' doors. And how we're using our retail and digital platforms to build our brands' breadth and depth with consumer is helping us outperform the marketplace.", "Here in the U.S. it's clear that we've got ourselves in a really uneven and inconsistent performance. But there are retailers and there are brands that are doing well in this marketplace. We're going to settle through retail closures. We all read the same reports.", "But I think the thing that we all need to really remember is that strong brands that have a very authentic connection with consumers, that are delivering unique products that provide consumers the opportunity to enjoy the experiences that they look for, position brands to succeed in this marketplace.", "We'll navigate this because of the strength of our portfolio. And it's really the learnings that we take in our European and Asia markets that are helping us fine tune our approach to segmentation and the use of the various product collections in those channels that's giving us confidence that we'll navigate it.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. I'd just add on to that, Omar. There are some fundamental differences. The U.S., we all look at the same numbers, right? The U.S. is over-stored as a general statement, much more than what you would see in Europe and Asia. So that's one issue.", "Also remember the relative time in market and maturity of our brands are less internationally. So we have a lot of room to run there, just from penetration and an expansion standpoint. So if you think about our business vis-\u00e0-vis those markets, that's how we look at it.", "And lastly, in the U.S., while its macro trends are certainly true, and again we've tried to say we will see disruption and choppiness as certain contractions and consolidations happen. There are clear winners out there, too, right? And we are winning with those winning retailers. And that's another reason why from a strategic standpoint, we've really pivoted and focused on our D2C and particularly our digital business.", "And you might remember from the Investor Day, 85% of our growth is coming from digital and digital partners. And of that 15% that's essentially in international.", "So in the next five years, we're not expecting much on a net basis from wholesale in the U.S. We will be winning disproportionately with some vendors. And we're also expecting that there will be continued consolidation that's going to occur over the next five years", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "That's really helpful, guys. Could I also ask a question about Timberland? That business continues to strengthen a little bit. Do you feel like you've got the right strategy and plan in place for that brand? Or is it really just more of a market level issue? Where that kind of active lifestyle has shifted away maybe from that rugged outdoor aesthetic to more of the athletic, athleisure aesthetic and you just kind of have to wait for that cycle to play out? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Omar, I mean, there's clearly a cycle that we're all seeing right now with the retro athletic. But to the point on Timberland, we absolutely believe we have the right strategy. And the proof point is what we see going on with our European business, who was much quicker to diversify across multiple franchises, specifically SensorFlex and the launch of AeroCore and have really brought down the percent to total of the boots, the total boot collection.", "We were slow to do that here in the United States market. And that work is underway. Jim [Pisani] did I thought a good job really of being able to explain that at the Investor Day. That work is underway.", "Concurrently, we've really elevated our apparel product creation, sitting now in our Stabio office, leveraging the strength of our apparel machine there. We're really seeing that investment pay out in our European marketplace. As that starts to come here to the U.S., we have confidence that that will be a growth driver.", "But we're also unlocking women's growth. And you'll remember the three focuses for Timberland are their men's business and the diversification across new franchises, women's and apparel. And again, the women's business and the strength that we're seeing with products designs in Europe that we're now bringing back into our Americas marketplace gives us confidence that we have the right product as we begin to be more diligent around segmentation and really diversifying those collections appropriately.", "Omar Saad - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Scott. That's really helpful. Good luck.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Omar.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "See you, Omar.", "Operator", "We'll go to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on innovation behind The North Face brand. It feels like for the last three years to four years, it's been concentrated around FuseForm, ThermoBall in particular. I guess first question, how much white space is left for these platforms to run? And then is there anything you can share with us on kind of what's next? How your thinking about better balancing the spring versus the fall line? Thanks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "No, Erinn, very good question. If you remember back in the Q4 call, I've talked about we need to own some of where The North Face finds itself today. We've leaned heavily on ThermoBall for the last three seasons. FuseForm, an interesting technology, and material innovation is important for our outerwear and ski wear.", "But what we need to be doing is really being much more thoughtful around multiyear line plans and product lifecycle management, married to our innovation platform. There are a number of innovation projects underway, specifically around materials but also design concepts for outerwear, footwear, equipment, and some very specifically in Sportswear. As now as we bring new leadership into both the overall brand and product, we're lining up that multiyear model with our innovation platform.", "And there's some exciting things coming this fall. I don't remember if I saw you at the Outdoor Retailer show. But there was an introduction of a new portion of our Summit Series collection engineered for ski mountaineering. But that also is having influence on some of the broader apparel product. And you're just seeing better designed product, more thoughtful use of materials, color, and fit. That we have a lot of confidence will open up the lens for our core consumers, but also broaden the lens for new consumers.", "And were seeing this prove out in our European business. I've talked about that a lot, but it's no secret that our European business is very, very successful right now. And it is the focus on product, the segmentation of that product into specific channel partners and our own stores. But it's also the quality of the leadership and really driving those very specific choices and being able to, season after season, build that momentum through really thoughtful product line management.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Scott, for you. Just going back to how you were kind of articulating the guidance, you talked about significant SG&A leverage in the back half. Can you just expound upon that? I guess if sales in the second half \u2013 you're obviously planning for a big acceleration as well.", "So if, whether it's environment or further bankruptcy, the sales weren't as high. Let's say they were in the low single digit range or mid-single. How do we think about kind of what the leverage you have on the SG&A would be in the back half? Thanks.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So first of all as CFO, I think every cost is variable. So that's probably kind of underneath your question, but \u2013 and so what does our guidance imply? So we said about 14% operating margin. And with the margin expansion that would imply an increase in SG&A. And you see that's relatively higher in the first part. And we see \u2013 we leverage that in the second half, and it comes down.", "First of all, I'd say we have a pretty good line of sight to the second half of the year. Right? And so we're not expecting a tremendous volatility. We see our order book. We see the trends. Now there's always some variability possible. But we have a lot of confidence in the second half. So that's the first comment I'd make.", "So secondly, we're also \u2013 we outlined a strategic plan in our Boston meeting. And we are investing behind those priorities. So the point I was trying to make by significant leverage is, obviously as the top line accelerates, we're going to see leverage, right, in the second half.", "We're also taking a lot of \u2013 a hard look at all the nonstrategic SG&A. We have a transformation project that we're going on \u2013 that we're undertaking here. And I'd call it more of a philosophy than a project actually. And we're challenging every spend item that we have in the P&L and saying, if it's not directly related to bringing our strategy forward, then we're empowering our leaders to take a hard look at that.", "And the fruits of that labor are, we're going to \u2013 we're seeing and will continue to see leverage in those nonstrategic areas. Our thought is that is a fuel that we put right back and reinvest against those strategic priorities.", "So again second, relative as the top line grows, we're going to see second half leverage. Remember in the first half we have a bit of a perfect storm. Right? We're opening our D2C \u2013 we're opening D2C stores. We see relative low wholesale growth for all the reasons that we detailed in our prepared remarks and some of the questions. We see that accelerating in the second half, and that's where you start to see that leverage.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Bob.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Bob.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could spend a little time just on Vans? The trends that you're seeing especially in the U.S. and the competitive set? Their inventory levels?", "And then the second question that I have is on the inventory levels in the business. So like with wholesale revenues being down 4% and inventories I think were up 2%, can you talk about how like wholesale inventories are for you guys heading into the remainder of the year? And how you're planning the wholesale part of the business versus your D2C part of the business, given that your expectations are for a significant pickup in the second half of the year?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "So, Bob, I'll take Vans and then let Scott grab that second question. So from a Vans standpoint here in the U.S. \u2013 but it, really it applies to how the Vans businesses is managing itself across each of the regions \u2013 is just a really strong, broad, diversified set of products, starting first with footwear. And not depending on a single style but really leveraging the Classics and then there within Old Skool, bringing new innovations in their Pro Skate collection.", "We're looking at new launches in apparel, launched a new Authentic Chino this spring, helped brought to market through our innovation platform. Just how we use the different franchises that we have across each of these apparel and footwear collections in their segmentation strategy. And how we bring those to life in our stores and digital I think really separates Vans from the rest of the marketplace.", "And it's their intense focus on their consumer and the focusing on those emotional elements of music, art, and street culture. And how we are connecting digitally with our consumers. Our customs platform, which we launched last year, continues to accelerate, as we expand (50:08) the offer and the means by which consumers can upload content to have us then transfer that onto footwear.", "They're just bringing a lot of new ideas each season across each of these different categories of product. And doing it consistently across the globe and tying that to the experiences that they have through marketing and events, really separates them from the rest of the marketplace and I think kind of puts them in a category in many ways in their own right.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. And so, Bob, versus you \u2013 or kind of your inventory related question. So a couple things. Number one, we do have pretty good line of sight to the balance of the year. So as it relates to the quality of our inventory, we feel good about that. Right? We don't see any issues and from a quality standpoint.", "Also remember that the marketplace is substantially cleaner as we look at it. Now there's a few \u2013 there's always a few pockets here and there. But as an overall statement, we would say that retail inventories are in good shape. And we don't see any issues on a go forward basis.", "Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kate McShane of Citi.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, with your guidance for Q2 of $0.27 to $0.30, I know you said the visibility to Jeanswear is tough, because you don't quite know where it's going to break. But what are you assuming for Jeanswear in order to get to that EPS growth?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So we're looking at down mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter. That's what our current guidance implies. And again what we're saying is we've seen some variability frankly in the first quarter. It was the timing shifted a little bit from us, and it was a little more severe than we had anticipated. We had some offsets, which helped us get back on an overall basis. And so we would \u2013 that's really what's behind the comment. Just a little uncertainty on how the timing of all this is going to wind through the process.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. And would you say what you're assuming is a base case scenario? Or...", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, if you back up, if you go to the high end of our range, that's essentially in line with what we said in February. Right? So we're saying we see a path to \u2013 and remember all this is excluding LSG. So the guidance we gave in February included LSG. We've kind of given you the roadmap on how to model, taking LSG out of it. So excluding that impact, the $0.30 would be right in line with our previous outlook. And we're saying there could be as much as a $0.03 variation on that, based on the timing of Jeanswear.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then my second question is, I know there have been some management changes in the Outdoor coalition and I think North Face as well. I just wondered if you could walk us through some of the newer hires that have been made? And if there are still any bigger positions that still need to be filled?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Sure, Kate, I'll do that. There have been some changes in our Outdoor business. Last year we made a change at Timberland in Jim Pisani, who presented at the Investor Conference, is our new leader there. Very excited about the leadership that he's bringing to that team.", "I think The North Face is where we have two openings of significance, our President and our Head of Product. We are very close to naming a new President for The North Face brand. And with that shortly thereafter with that individual's participation we'll make that move on [Head of] Product.", "The good news is we have some really steady strong sets of hands in that business. Scott Baxter, out head of that group is working day to day with our North Face brand. We've recently moved Arne Arens from Europe, our GM of our European business is now our GM of the Americas. Arne has presented at the Investor Conference. Very strong history with our brands, strong leadership, and deep, deep understanding of our brand.", "So really feel confident about where we are in our North Face kind of time line. And the \u2013 really the search that we've utilized to identify that new leader.", "Now we also placed a new President at Smartwool. And Travis [Campbell] comes to us from a relatively similar background, very strong general management skills, passion for this category and the outdoors. And he's bringing really good leadership to that brand. So those would be those openings that we've had and feeling good about where we are.", "Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Robert W Baird.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes. Hi. Thanks. Scott, if I could ask just a clarification on the guidance for the full year first of all. I understand 2016 coming lower when you exclude the LSG business. I'm just wondering the thought on holding the earnings decline rate for 2017. I would assume that you might have some proceeds from LSG that you could put to productive use through buying back stock or something like that. So any comment on either the proceeds or kind of the assumptions behind holding the growth rate?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. No. Good question. So we talked about returning $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, which includes a $1 billion repurchase. Obviously, we had some line of sight to what's going on with LSG. And so we were assuming those proceeds in that $1 billion buyback. So we are not intending to increase the $1 billion at this time.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the gross margin cadence through the year, I just wanted to ask about some of the puts and takes. I mean, obviously the first quarter was strong. And I think might account for your entire full-year projected gross margin increase. So I'm just wondering for the next three quarters what some of the puts and takes you see there.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. Yeah. I'd say it was really strong by the way. So, yeah, we saw mix was really strong in the first quarter, about 80 basis points. And that's close to what we see for the year, a little less than that for the year. And our rate was up 110 basis points.", "Several factors there. So we do see some price benefit. It's about 1% for the full year. And that's a little bit more toward the first half. Cost, the same. We see cost benefit in the first half. That actually turns the other way in the second half and for the year. And that's to kind of a small number. Those are some different \u2013 those are two shaping things.", "And then finally, if you just think about that mix number as it evolves. So as our Jeanswear business accelerates, as our Image business accelerates throughout the year, you're going to see some of that mix come back the other direction. So off to a really good start one quarter in.", "The other thing I would just remind everybody at this point, we're one quarter in and we got a lot of real estate ahead of us. So could we have been a little conservative? Maybe. But looking at the balance of puts and takes, we think that's a prudent place to be one quarter into the year.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And just to follow up, your prepared remark about sacrificing a little growth for quality near term. Is that more backward looking in the last quarter or two? Or do you see that continuing?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Well, I think you'll see a continuation of that philosophy. Now the reality is, a lot of that is behind us now in terms of, we're not doing much off-price. There's not much included in this outlook for 2017, because we've already cleaned a lot of that up.", "In general, what we've said is, we would prefer to dispose of things through our own outlets. It's more brand appropriate. And that's really why they're there. And so if that means holding a little inventory and selling it through in a more brand enhancing way, then we're going to make that choice.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. Just to follow up on that too. I think you're starting to really see \u2013 I said this in my prepared remarks, but we believe we're really starting to see that philosophy pay off. And of the best proxies for that is gross margin. And we're really encouraged to see that strong gross margin rate in the first quarter. We talked about focus on fundamentals. That's one of the markers that shows that the strategy is paying off.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sam Poser, Susquehanna.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you for taking my question. I've got two questions. One is more housekeeping. Can you give us some idea of the JanSport and Licensed sports revenue by quarter for last year, so we can really model this properly?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So we gave you the quarter and the full year in the table and we've said it's $0.03 to $0.04 per quarter from an earnings standpoint. So while I guess we didn't break out exactly the by quarter, you can assume based on that that it's fairly evenly spread through the balance of the year.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And then I mean \u2013 and then secondly, I mean, I guess my question is, is with the U.S., the sort of mature U.S. market for some of your larger brands. One, within your guidance for Jeanswear and in general, how many store closures domestically do you have built in to like the current guidance and the five-year guidance?", "And then secondly, what gives you the confidence that the European influence will move appropriately to the U.S.? I mean, what direction \u2013 are you sure it's going that way? Or is it just that the international businesses are less developed, started? Like the Timberland business overseas doesn't have the reliance on the Classic boot. How do you get a gauge on what's pushing what which direction, I guess?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yes. I'll start with the kind of the numbers side of that question, Sam. So we're not going to get into the specifics of what we've put in or what's in, what's out. But just generally, just to reorient the comments I made earlier. We're really not expecting in the five-year plan any net wholesale growth in the U.S.", "And within that we will see growth for sure, but we know it's going to be choppy. We may have a year where we see a little growth. Then we may see continued bankruptcies. And we're sure that's going to happen. We have modeled it behind the scenes. But that's not \u2013 for reasons I think you can appreciate, that's not something that we're going to talk about, what we're assuming on some of our customers in a public forum.", "Just know that again when you think about where is our growth going to come from? It's going to come from our D2C, our digital, and that includes our digital partners as well, and our international wholesale. That's what's driving the next five years from our standpoint.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yes. Sam, we absolutely see further consolidation here in the U.S. market. And really we've built our plans with that in mind. And to Scott's point, that net neutral number wholesale here in the U.S. market.", "The comment around Europe and the influence that we see from our international business, it's not necessarily style or designs that we have in those marketplaces. It's more the discipline around thoughtful segmentation, elevated product, really strong experiential marketing within our own environments and our wholesale partners, and the way our leadership teams, in specifically Europe, are driving the business in a very methodical, professional way. It's those disciplines and the need to elevate product, our focus around design and innovation, and what that means to product and brand experience, that's what I'd ask you to take away.", "And those disciplines being utilized across our business. It's the disciplines that sit within our Vans North America business here. It's one of the reasons they're so successful in putting together quarter after quarter positive results. It's taking that discipline, making sure it's well placed in each of our large brands, and just having the disciplined conversations to give us confidence in the long term sustainability of our growth.", "But this is \u2013 to be honest with you, Sam, this is one of the reasons we made management changes, is to really get that leadership in place. The movement of Arne to our U.S. business, just bringing that focus, that leadership presence to these key brands gives us confidence that everything we've been talking about from a longer-term standpoint is absolutely within our line of sight.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thanks. And one last thing. I mean with The North Face brand, when you talk so much about all the technical attributes. There was an earlier question regarding some of the different technologies that you've had over the years and what you have.", "I mean how much of this is technology related? And how much of it is style related? I mean if your stuff looks good and keeps you warm and protects you and breathes appropriately, isn't that sort of expected? And then the changing of styling and compelling other people to buy new stuff, is this technology \u2013 and I've read this in the notes about other companies. Is this technology the icing or the cake when it comes to the brand?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Wow, Sam, that's a question at a guy who really loves technology. So I'll have to be careful about how I manage this answer.", "It's both. It's style first. We know that when a consumer walks into a store, they notice color, followed by style. That brings you over to look at the product. And then how you interact with it is where your \u2013 again some of the style components of the quality of the material. Can I understand what the technology is in the garment? Is it relevant to my needs?", "It's why we have moved to this consumer focused business unit approach, is having more of a clear understanding across those four brand territories of what the consumer needs are. Style and function, equally balanced, and really having the discipline of building thoughtful collections for each of the channels of distribution. So we can put the very best designed product with all of the right features and functions out there. So that when you do use the product, that it performs to the highest level of expectation. But at the same time you feel good and look good in that product. So it's really a balance of both", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you very much and good luck.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "And that is all the time we have for questions. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Rendle for any additional or closing comments", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "So thank you, everybody, for joining us. We're excited to share with you how we've begun the year. I hope what you take away is our growth drivers remain very much intact. And our three largest brands, delivering against expectation, and in some cases doing a little bit better. Our D2C and digital platforms performing well. And international continuing to deliver strong results.", "And all of that balanced with our fundamentals, as we look to improve how we operate, the gross margin expansion that's giving us the confidence and the fuel to invest behind our strategic choices, as we pivot to become more consumer and retail centric. And really giving us a much more agile and efficient approach to our go-to-market. So thank you. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference for today.

Thank you, you may begin.", "Joe Alkire", "Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements.

These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Steve?", "Steven Rendle", "Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Our third quarter results were a bit stronger than expected. With broad based strength across core growth engines. International, direct-to-consumer, our big three brands and Workwear. Our focus and investment in support of our 2021 strategies driving accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio. We are in the early phases of this strategic journey we began earlier this year and while the rapidly changing consumer landscape and dynamic retail environment around the world is sometimes difficult to predict, we are confident that the choices and capabilities embedded in our strategic growth plan will enable our strong portfolio of diverse global brands to connect more deeply with consumers and fuel accelerated growth. ", "Third quarter revenue increased 4% as our momentum continued to accelerate. As a reminder, our growth rate during the quarter was reduced by about 3% due to the shift in timing of our fall order book, which we discussed during our last call. Our big three brands, Vans, The North Face and Timberland, grew at a combined rate of 6% in the quarter. Our international business grew 10%, including 14% growth in Europe and 9% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer increased 17% with more than 35% growth in digital. Our Workwear business grew 11% and our digital wholesale accounts a key growth driver for VF during the next five years increased more than 20%.", "Gross margin improved 180 basis points in the quarter, excluding a negative 80 basis points impact from FX. The continued strength of our gross margin demonstrates the power of our diversified model and the discipline and focus we place on quality growth. Adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.23 in the quarter. This is ahead of the outlook range we provided in July. ", "Based in our strong third quarter performance and confidence in the balance of the year, we are once again increasing our full year outlook, raising our dividend for the 45th year in a row, while at the same time, committing an additional $25 million to fuel growth. Combined with the $40 million we announced in July, we have now committed $65 million of additional investment behind our strategy relative to our initial outlook in February.", "We will continue to evolve VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric. You are beginning and I stress beginning to see that comes to life in our results. We will reshape our portfolio and align ourselves with our financial aspirations. We\u2019ve made progress thus far in 2017, but we are not finished. We see many unique catalysts to ignite accelerated growth and value creation during the next several years and we look forward to updating you on our progress. ", "And finally, before getting into the specific brand results, as you know, we formally welcomed Williamson-Dickie to VF family on October 2nd. Our integration teams have worked in a collaborative matter since we announced the transaction. The teams and those that support them, I extend a sincere thank you. While, it\u2019s early, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the chemistry within the teams and even more confident about the value creation synergies, we see within our existing Workwear platform, it\u2019s great to have the Williamson-Dickie people part of VF. ", "With that lets review our third quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands, Workwear and Sportswear. Beginning with The North Face brand, as expected global revenue decreased 3% driven primarily by the order book timing shift that we discussed during our prior call. As expected on a more normalized basis global revenue increased 3%. ", "D2C results were strong and increased at a low double-digit rate with mid-single digit comps and more than 20% growth from digital, wholesale was down 6% however excluding the order book shift, wholesale would have increased at a low single digit rate. By region, revenue in Americas as expected declined 10%, high single digit D2C growth including more than 12% growth in digital was more than offset by a mid-teen decrease in wholesale which was influenced by the order book shift. Without the shift, revenue in the Americas was down about 1%", "Turning to product performance, lifestyle, accessories and fall transition products such as rainwear and lightweight piece generated solid growth in the quarter. In August The North Face brand launched its Walls Are Meant for Climbing campaign and partnered with climbing gyms around the world to inspire athletes to climb new heights and explore the outdoors. The campaign intended to unite our global communities to the sport of climbing, is the perfect embodiment of The North Face spirit of exploration ", "In Europe the brand\u2019s momentum continued with revenue growth of 17% including mid teen growth in wholesale and high teen growth in D2C. Our digital business was particularly strong growing more than 50% in the quarter. ", "Consumer demand for The North Face brand remains exceptionally strong across the region with double digit growth across all major product categories, and building on our success in Asia the urban exploration product territories now in select markets across Europe and initial sell through results have been exceptional. Given the broad-based momentum we have in the region we expect growth to accelerate further as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2018. ", "As expected, Asia returned to growth and was up 4%. D2C increased at a mid-teen rate with almost 30% growth from digital and wholesale increased at a low single digit rate. Our fall season is off to a solid start with the strength from the GORE jacket and our urban exploration product territory. Now the outdoor market in China remains highly promotional our brand is strong and we expect accelerated growth as we move into the fourth quarter. There is no change to our full year outlook for The North Face brand as we continue to expect growth to be at the high end of the mid-single digit range. ", "Now to our largest and fastest growing brand Vans, which achieved record setting growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 26% with strength across all regions, channels and product franchises. ", "Revenue in the Americas grew 22%, Europe increased 39% and Asia Pacific grew 23%. D2C increased more than 30% including almost 30% comp growth and 60% growth in our digital business. Wholesale increased 19% with mid-single digit growth in the Americas and more than 35% growth internationally. We offer big congratulations to our Vans team around the world. The consistency and depth of the brand's performance is truly remarkable. ", "The ongoing energy and behind the Vans brand continues to grow with strong momentum across nearly all product categories. Vans icons including the old school and black and white checkerboard designs more than doubled in the quarter. The new Ultra range franchise launch exceeded expectations in our Back to School period with 50% sell through in D2C and about 75% sell through at wholesale, even with the higher average selling price. ", "We also launched our Customs 2.0 platform in Europe, helping to ignite accelerated growth on our digital platform in the region. During the quarter, Vans opened a new aspirational boutique store, The General in Brooklyn, which showcases its elevated product as well as the Vans Customs platform with fabric samples and everything else you need to build a custom pair of Vans. This space exemplifies what Vans is all about, inspiring, created self-expression with consumers in communities it serves.", "Some of you may be wondering whether this level of growth for Vans is sustainable. Let me just say, the confidence we have in our largest brand is high. The brand is stronger than it has ever been with broad-based growth across all regions, channels and product categories. Retail inventory levels are in great shape and we remain disciplined with respect to inventory management, merchandising and assortment planning. ", "While we see a strong growth trajectory for this brand as we move into 2018, the year-over-year comparisons is going to be difficult. Then again over the past six years, the Vans brand has grown at a mid-teen rate. So, the comparisons have always been somewhat difficult. Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, as well as increased growth expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect about 15% growth for the Vans brand in 2017, up from our prior outlook at the high end of the low double-digit range.", "Switching to Timberland, global revenue declined 2% driven by the same shift in timing of the fall order book that impacted The North Face brand. As expected the timing shift reduced global revenue by approximately 5% in the quarter, high single digit growth in D2C, including more than 35% growth in digital was more than offset by a mid-single digit decline in wholesale.", "Timberland brand revenue in the Americas declined 7%. However, on a normalized basis, revenue increased at a low single digit rate. High single digit growth in D2C was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale due to the order book timing shift previously mentioned. From a product perspective, our non-classics business increased at a low double-digit rate as our diversification strategy begins to take hold. Our new platforms such as SensorFlex and AeroCore saw more than 75% growth and our women's product also continues to appeal to consumers with 20% growth in D2C. And our Timberland PRO business remained very strong with more than 30% growth. ", "In Europe, Timberland brand revenue increased 3% which was also influenced by a shift in timing of the fall order book. Results were driven by mid-teen growth in D2C and low single digit growth in wholesale. Our digital business was very strong increasing more than 50% with strong results from our new locally designed women's platform. Our momentum across the region is strong and our growth broad-based with high single to low double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel.", "Timberland Asia business declined 5% driven by the timing of shipments. Mid-single digit growth in D2C was offset by a low teen decline in wholesale. Our outerwear was particularly strong supported by the M65 Jacket campaign. There is no change to our low single digit growth outlook for the Timberland brand in 2017, which includes high single digit growth in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to the Wrangler brand, revenue increased 4% during the quarter with high-teen growth in D2C and mid-single digit growth in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas increased 6% while revenue in Europe declined 2% and Asia declined 10% because of the ongoing weakness in India. Our third quarter results for the Wrangler brand were in line with our expectations, however, our visibility in the U.S. Jeanswear business remains low and we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability in the near term. That said sell-through at retail improved late in the third quarter giving us the confidence that the initiatives put in place by a key customer are showing early signs of success. ", "From a digital perspective, we\u2019re seen strength across our digital wholesale partners, as well as our own wrangler.com business, which increased more than 20%. Our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand may extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail, also continue to gain traction. ", "Turning to product, our limited release capsules and collaborations have done exceptionally well from our born ready collection, which features unique pieces, it\u2019s celebrated Wrangler's rich heritage to our collaboration with designer Peter Max. And hopefully some of these [indiscernible] Wrangler brand are prominently featured in a store front in Herald Square. There is no change to our 2017 outlook for the Wrangler brand, which includes low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter.", "Now to the Lee brand. Revenue declined 8% as 15% growth in D2C was more than offset by a low-double-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was down 14%, as the brand continues to grapple with ongoing wholesale channel pressures and consolidation. While, our women\u2019s business remains challenged, our men\u2019s denim business is performing well and was up at a high-single-digit rate including strong performance from our Xtreme Comfort khakis and Extreme Motion Denim products. ", "Lee Europe was up 7% with more than 20% growth in D2C, including 40% growth in digital. Wholesale increased at a mid-single-digit rate. ", "In Asia, revenue declined 4% driven by continuing weakness in India. ", "Our women\u2019s business in China increased at a double-digit rate powered by our BODY OPTIX and Jade Fusion innovation platforms. Based on Lee\u2019s third quarter performance as well as slightly weaker than expected growth outlook for the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2017 revenue outlook for Jeanswear. We now expect full year revenue to decline modestly versus our previous expectations without flat revenue. ", "Turning now to Imagewear. Revenue was up 8% in the quarter; the core image business was up 4% excluding the impact of jersey revenue connected to the sale of LSG. Bulwark had another strong quarter and importantly red cap returned to growth as the recovery in the industrial sector continues. ", "Looking at our Workwear platform, which includes our image business, as well as Timberland Pro and Wrangler RIGGS footwear revenue growth accelerated 11% with double-digit growth from our three largest brands. Timberland Pro increased more than 30%, Bulwark was up 12% and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear generated 17% growth. We continue to expect our Imagewear and Workwear businesses to increase at a mid and high-single-digit rate respectively in 2017. ", "Looking at Sportswear. The business continues to stabilize with improvements across the wholesale and D2C. Revenue for Nautica was about flat, while the Kipling Americas business achieved low-single-digit growth. The new management team we put in place earlier this year has worked hard at restoring profitability and their efforts are clearly showing results. ", "Thank you to everybody on the Nautica team. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott. ", "Scott Roe", "Thanks, Steve. Before I get started, let\u2019s review a few housekeeping items that influenced our reported third quarter results. First, we took $105 million pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the Nautica brand. Despite recent improvements and financial performance, our strategic assessment of the brand determined the assets to be impaired which resulted in the related charge. ", "Second, we incurred about $5 million of pre-tax acquisition-related expenses associated with the Williamson-Dickie transaction. On a combine basis, the two items just mentioned negatively impacted our reported earnings by $0.26. ", "Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results, my comments will focus on our adjusted results excluding the impairment and acquisition related expenses just mentioned. Our third quarter results were strong with broad based strength across international and direct-to-consumer platforms, outdoor and action sports and Workwear. Revenue increased 4% to $3.5 billion and excluding the order book timing shift for The North Face in Timberland brands, our underlying growth rate was approximately 7%. ", "Revenue for our big three brands was up 6% on a combined basis led by very strong results from Vans which was up 26%. The underlying passion for Vans across the globe is truly unique. What gets us most excited is how this deep emotional connection coupled with the tribal nature of the Vans family will continue to drive exceptional performance. While we don\u2019t expect to maintain these stellar growth rates indefinitely, these results give us confidence in the vision we have for this brand and the growth targets we laid out in Boston. ", "As expected, The North Face and Timberland brands declined 3% and 2% respectively. However, both brands grew at a low single-digit rate normalizing for the order book timing shift. Our Workwear business increased 11% and importantly our Jeanswear collation continued to sequentially improve driven by Wrangler which returned to growth in the quarter and was up 4%. ", "International increased 10% as our growth continues to accelerate. Our Europe business was particularly strong, up 14%, and just to put some context around the strength we are seeing in Europe, our big three brands grew 17%, wholesale was up at a low teen rate including almost 30% growth from our digital partners. Direct-to-consumer increased at a high teen rate including more than 40% growth in digital and we achieve double-digit growth across almost every mark, every major market. ", "Our European business is clearly firing on all cylinders and as one of our most profitable platforms, when combined with an efficient tax structure enables us to drive significant value creation. The broad base strength we see across the region will carry into 2018, so a big thank you to the European team. ", "China remain strong and was up 9% with particular strength in Vans, D2C and digital. Our direct-to-consumer business was up 17% led by more than 30% growth in digital. Our Outdoor Action Sports, Jeanswear and international businesses all achieved at least high teen growth with double-digit comps in our global brick and motor business. Our efforts to the [steward] investment towards store experience and digital while focusing on the productivity of our fleet are showing results. ", "Wholesale revenue was in line with last year, however excluding the order book shift, wholesale was up at a low single-digit rate. International delivered high single-digit wholesale growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew more than 20%. ", "Gross margin remains strong at 50.1% up a 100 basis points which includes an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX, that is 180 basis point increase currency neutral which is pretty much in line with our first half results. ", "Our stronger than expected gross margin was a result of more favorable mix and better full priced sell-through. Our gross margin is the by-product of our disciplined and focused approach on quality growth. Gross margin expansion is a core element of our diversified value creation model and provides us flexibility and fuel to accelerate investments and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.", "SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 240 basis points to 33.2% in the quarter. Our ratio was distorted a little bit by the order book timing shift, which resulted in about 40 basis points of deleverage. ", "Let me take a few minutes now and walk you through the remainder of our SG&A increase. More than half of that increase was driven by investments in D2C, demand and product creation, innovation and technology. In fact, most of the increase was in D2C and particularly in digital, which is where we have momentum and stronger profitability, and when coupled with our higher incentive compensation compared to a weaker performance a year ago, we've accounted for more than 90% of the change. ", "Based on our increased confidence, we've committed an additional $25 million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year. That is in addition to the $40 million we announced last quarter. So relative to the initial outlook we provided in February we\u2019ve committed $65 million dollars to transform VF into an agile, digitally enabled consumer centric organization.", "Now to answer a question likely on your mind, excluding the impact of Williamson-Dickie, we do expect a more moderate pace of SG&A growth in Q4 and as we head into 2018. There is no change in our long-term SG&A, or operating margin targets we communicated in Boston and if anything, we're even more confident in our ability to achieve these targets as we sit here today.", "Third quarter adjusted operating margin declined 140 basis points to 16.9% including an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. So, on an adjusted basis, EPS increased 10% to $1.23. Relative to the range we provided in July, our third quarter earnings benefited by about $0.07 from FX and a lower tax rate.", "Turning to our balance sheet, our inventory increased 1%. Our inventory are in good shape and from the days outstanding perspective, it\u2019s starting to come back in line. Given our strong third quarter results and increased growth trajectory we see for the balance of 2017, we are once again raising our full year outlook. Our updated outlook now includes the following.", "Reported revenue is expected to be up 6%, about 5.5% on a currency neutral basis to approximately $12.1 billion. That compares to our previous expectation of $11.85 billion. Our increased revenue outlook is driven by our core growth engines, Outdoor & Action Sports, most notably Vans, D2C, particularly digital and broad-based strength across our international business. Our revenue outlook continues to contemplate about $200 million contribution from Williamson-Dickie.", "Gross margin is expected to approximate 50% which includes 50 basis point headwind from FX. This represents 50 basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of 49.5%. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be about 13.4% versus the previous estimate of 13.7%. This includes a 50 basis point negative impact from changes in FX as well as the impact of an additional $25 million investment. Excluding the impact of Williamson-Dickie, we expect our adjusted operating margin to be about 13.6%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $3.01, up 1% on a reported basis or up 6% on a currency neutral basis, relative to the 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.98. Our outlook includes the $0.05 of additional investment, as well as a $0.02 contribution from Williamson-Dickie. As a reminder, our prior outlook was $2.96. ", "Finally, we now expect our cash flow from operations to reach about $1.5 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and our dividend and share repurchase program are key components of our diversified value creation model. Based on our performance and the confidence we have in our strategic growth plan, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This marks the 45th consecutive year, we\u2019ve increased our annual dividend. With this increase our calendar 2017 dividend, we\u2019ll reach $1.72, a 12% increase compared with the prior year. When combined with our share repurchase, our cash returns to shareholders in 2017 will approach $1.9 billion, that\u2019s an 8% yield based on our current market cap. ", "So, with three quarters behind us, we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter. Our core growth engines are delivering double-digit growth, our gross margin is strong, our fundamentals are intact and we are investing in our future and given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan, we\u2019re putting money to work behind our largest brands in growth platforms, while returning additional cash to shareholders. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator and we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please state your question. ", "Laurent Vasilescu", "I want to follow-up on the wholesale business for the fourth quarter. Besides the $100 million shift from 3Q into 4Q, are there any additional shift between the fourth quarter and next year\u2019s sub quarter? ", "And then secondly for the fourth quarter stripping out Williamson-Dickie\u2019s revenues, should we assume wholesale revenues on an organic basis will be up mid-single digits year-over-year?", "Scott Roe", "That\u2019s about right. On the second part of your question Laurent, it should be up about that rate. And no, there is no other big shifts other than order book timing between Q3 and Q4. ", "Laurent Vasilescu", "And then I wanted to follow-up on the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Since the acquisition was announced in August, curious to know if you gained any additional learnings you might want to share on the call. ", "And then finally since Williamson-Dickie was an all-cash transaction, can you remind us, how much leverage you want to take on, if you choose to pursue an additional acquisition?", "Scott Roe", "So, I\u2019ll take the second part of that first and before Steve comments on what we\u2019ve learned. We said that we\u2019re guarding our rating, which is generally two times EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA, two times. However, for the right acquisition we\u2019re willing to stretch that even to the point of one step down rate, if we had the right opportunity. So, if you do the math, that ought to imply, a lot of capacity. ", "The other thing is with our strong cash flow, our metrics snap back into line pretty quick here. So, we\u2019re really -- we have dry powder even today and as we look at the contribution from Williamson-Dickie and the rest of our portfolio, we\u2019re backing in kind of historical levels in a very rapid manner. ", "Steven Rendle", "And then Laurent, on what we\u2019ve learned with Williamson-Dickie so far, I mean we\u2019re really still early but we couldn\u2019t be at here. We have down there a passionate committed team that looks and acts a lot like VF and are really integrating well with our Imagewear team and the broader Workwear team. Brands are great, we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re learning about Dickie\u2019s and the [indiscernible] fitted as globally, and what we think we can do with it here in the United States and the synergies that we\u2019ve called out from the beginning absolutely are there and committed teams working across 12 major work streams getting after just that exactly.", "Operator", "Next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please state your question. ", "Dana Telsey", "Good morning and congratulations. As you can think about the strength of the gross margin, how do you think about the puts and takes? Is there anything to note by brand or collation that could be lasting going forward that we should watch for? ", "And just lastly for the incremental investments any color on where that\u2019s going, how are they seasoned and your outlook on it. Thank you.", "Scott Roe", "Yeah, good morning Dana. So, a couple of things on that related to gross margin. The story on gross margin really hasn\u2019t change its mix and the mix is our fast-growing businesses are highest gross margin and you saw in this quarter results particular strength in D2C and digital which that coupled with international and particularly Europe really have popped the gross margin in the quarter. But as we look forward, we expect those same drivers to continue, right. So, it was a little exaggerated in the third quarter also because our wholesale business for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked at for the long time was a little bit down from the timing standpoint, but overall, we see that mix driving forward in the next year and beyond.", "Steven Rendle", "And then Dana on the demand -- on how we\u2019re looking at the investments, about half of the investments that you\u2019ve seen is deployed this year are around demand creation and that\u2019s very much focused on Q3 and Q4 specifically towards D2C, our digital platform, but also driving broader brand awareness that benefits not only our broader brand but our wholesale partners. ", "We\u2019re also investing on many of our strategic priorities, in the roadmaps that we\u2019ve put in place specifically around data analytics, what we\u2019re doing with our digital platform, there are investments around advanced manufacturing and some of the innovation work we have going on there and clearly pushing dollars towards our design capability within our big brands. ", "Scott Roe", "Dana, also asked about what we\u2019re seeing in the holiday, what\u2019s our outlook from a holiday standpoint.", "Steven Rendle", "Fair enough. Okay. So, I\u2019d say Dana, we saw October start a little bit slow but as we see the weather turn in our favor, we\u2019ve seen really acceleration and that\u2019s very much a North America comment. We\u2019re bullish, our order book really reflects how our wholesale partners are thinking about setting up their floors more in line with consumer demand, that\u2019s here in the United States, but it\u2019s also true that how we\u2019re working in Europe and Asia and you really think we\u2019ve got good assortment sitting on the floors at the right time, inventories that are good check, and really now it's about driving sell through and that\u2019s where that demand creation investment has been put forward to help to drive that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please take your question.", "Omar Saad", "Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So, if you could talk a little bit more detail about Vans, I mean, the performance there really stands out as you know. Maybe you can go a little bit deeper in some of the strategies that are working, how you\u2019re executing to generate such consistent strong performance globally in a broad-based way? And then maybe tie in digital and social media, if that an important element to what\u2019s going on with that brand and if there are learnings that you\u2019re developing around Vans that you can apply to some of the other assets in your portfolio? Thanks.", "Scott Roe", "Great, Omar. Vans' performance is fantastic and the congratulations you put out to our team. So, I think know what the primary -- one of the primary reasons this brand is doing so well, it is the team that works on this brand across the globe and their intense focus and deeper understanding of who their consumer is. And we talk a lot about our expressive creator and who they are, what's important to them and how to reach them with our demand creation, and that really is about the social media in the digital platform. ", "I think key things that are driving these results, Omar, it starts with product, the way our business team there, it really manages franchises and really things through the integrated marketplace, lands, placing the appropriate products in the right locations. And then the appropriate amount of newness, be it, new [color ways], the collabs that we do season to season, or the Ultra range that we launched this fall that are completely new product, higher price point, is continuing to move the brand further down its path. ", "I would tell you, I think probably our single strength natural product, it\u2019s our D2C and how our brands stories are told within our own environments. You can see that here in the U.S. and across the globe and as we start to really mature and improving that area, we are starting to see us bring a segmented approach to boutiques that come and meet around The New General in Brooklyn to how that complements our street front and mall-based stores and how that all links together with our digital platform. It really is a well-oiled machine, very focused in deep understanding of the consumer and it really is about the digital connectivity and the storytelling that we tell to the digital platform that we think, is one of those key strategic advantages.", "Steven Rendle", "Yeah. I will just add-on Omar that -- when you think about our investments and where we're making our investments, a lot of the digital platform inspiration has come out of Vans team, not all, but a lot of it. And as we make our investments, we're investing in [via applied] platforms, so that that learning and that capability can be -- that we can take advantage of that across the entire enterprise. ", "It would be hard for any one brand individually to fund this kind of investment and that's where we think the power of the portfolio when we have this is kind of how we approach these things. And this is one of our key strategic choices that we've made as we outlined in Boston. A close relation to that is also the customs platform, again piloted in Vans, but absolutely applicable for the wider enterprise and we see, this as continuing to grow throughout the organization. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question.", "Camilo Lyon", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the FX impact. Seems like there was a pretty large swing from last quarter to this quarter as it relates to the overall guide for the year since it gets about 150 basis points swing to positive. Could you help us frame how that benefit could continue into 2018 and how we should be thinking about that component as that\u2019s been a pretty big bag [indiscernible].", "Scott Roe", "Yes. So obviously, first of all, we don\u2019t try to get cues as it relates to currency. We got a basket of currency we\u2019re looking at and best of our knowledge, we call that, essentially where it is for the balance of the year and that\u2019s reflective and the outlook that we just talked about. As you look into \u201918, I guess couple of things. Number one remember that we had with a pretty long tail here, so we\u2019re going out 12 to 18 months. So, a lot of this has already been baked at slightly different rates as you look into next year, so you just got to remember that. Also from a translation standpoint, of course wherever the currencies are right now, that looks like, that\u2019s a tailwind, hopefully that will be the case. I would also just caution you to not focus too much on one factor, right. As we look into next year, cost is up a little bit in the fourth quarter, for example, we\u2019ll see that knock into next year. Yes, currency looks like, it\u2019s a tailwind, but you got to look at the balanced picture and we\u2019re not at the point of giving guidance for 2018 at this point. ", "Camilo Lyon", "And then just two other quick questions. Number one, just on the incremental investments that you\u2019re able to, book back into this business. Should we consider this a pull forward of planned investments or is this resetting a level -- higher level of expense that likely gets free after next year. ", "And then even more broadly speaking about the advanced manufacturing capabilities, can you just remind us, where you\u2019re adding those initiatives and how we should start to see and when we should start to see some of the benefit that you\u2019d expect to deliver from faster, more speed like manufacturing initiatives?", "Scott Roe", "Yes. Camilo, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. Here is what I would say relative to the investments. And remember, we laid out a strategy and behind that strategy a roadmap of investments. And if you think about the shape that we talked about at the plan in Boston, in general, we\u2019re going to see investments a little more front loaded and you\u2019re going to see our top-line continue to accelerate. So, it\u2019s not so much. Yes, we are moving faster down a path. Our intent is to continue to invest, to invest around these priorities. So, while, it may not be the exact same thing, right, we\u2019re making innovations in our digital platform for example, you don\u2019t have to do that twice, that will be the next thing, when you think about customs, mobility, a lot of the innovation initiatives, we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments. ", "Also, as it relates to demand creation, there is two sides to your question number one, if we should have a three-signal event and be in a very different place, could we stop these investments sure, we could. We think about demand creation we look at in [MROI] and we always are judging that the payback is there and whether we are willing to make that investment it is a discretionary investment that we can make a choice on, but our intent is to continue to invest in demand creation, in fact our plans said we intend to increase demand creation as a percentage of sales and grow it faster than sales. ", "So, our intent will be to continue, obviously there is variability if we should have a fundamental change in the market, but we don\u2019t anticipate that nor is that our intention to modulate. ", "Steven Rendle", "And Camilo on the advance manufacturing portion of your question. I mean this is an exciting area and we\u2019ve talked a little bit, not to a great degree because of much what we\u2019re doing here we consider to be fairly proprietary. But I think it\u2019s fair to say, we have gone through and continue go through really in-depth end-to-end analysis of our total timeline around product creation and breaking down where those elements for us bring innovation and improve speed, efficiency and really affectedness. ", "So, on the upstream side, that\u2019s really looking closely at our design and development capabilities and where can we bring technology to improve speed. But the advance manufacturing piece which is really little bit less than a half of the total time of our timeline is about looking at how do we breakdown material manufacturing and other things that we can do around improving speed at material finishing, adjacent to our production facilities and within the production facilities we\u2019re looking at a whole host of technologies to improve efficiency. ", "I would tell you our supply chain is already very automated, if you were to go into our Jeanswear facilities here in the Americas you\u2019d see a highly automated and efficient model. We think there is improvements to be had there, especially as we can marry up material finishing closer to where we produced. But a lot of things going on inside the black box that we\u2019re standing up here in North Carolina to really test out our theories, prove it and then scale it as we can, not only in our own production, but with key partners. ", "Scott Roe", "One final thought too Camilo, as you think about all these investments whether be advance manufacturing or other priorities, our first commitment is to the shareholder, right. And we\u2019ve made commitments and we ensure that we\u2019re delivering against those and we\u2019re always trying to balance delivering our commitments to the shareholder with advancing and future stake growth. And that\u2019s a big part of our conversation on an ongoing basis. ", "Camilo Lyon", "Is there a brand that would get the frontend benefit of those initiatives on the manufacturing front that you\u2019re focusing on or is that a complete portfolio benefit as it starts to rollout?", "Scott Roe", "We\u2019re looking pretty broadly at this point, Camilo, across our portfolio of apparel, footwear and equipment. There are certain categories that probably lend themselves more than the other, but right now we\u2019re more focused on breaking down really the phases of how the product is produced and then we\u2019ll marry that back in to for sure our big three. We\u2019ll see the biggest focus, but there are some brands within our portfolio that are particularly well suited as incubators for us to test, learn before we look to scale to the big three.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please say your question.", "Samuel Poser", "Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things. When we look into next year, this is just more housekeeping, are you going to sort of restate everything to -- are you creating any Workware segment or how should we\u2019ll be thinking about that with the Dickies acquisition?", "Scott Roe", "Yeah, at this point, Sam, we haven't decided to change any of our reporting segments, obviously that's ongoing evaluations that we're looking at a line of portfolio changes. At this point we haven't made that decision.", "Samuel Poser", "Thank you. And then, secondly, one of the things I was seeing, just reported in news was that, you\u2019re getting some placement sort of a Paris Fashion Week with some of The North Face products and so on. Can you talk about that due direction and how you work to exploit that? Is that part of the whole city stuff you are doing out of China? Could you give us some color there?", "Steven Rendle", "Yes, Sam. What you have read there is exciting, that's part of our urban exploration territory, that's part of the really breaking down the consumer, use education into the four individual elements. But urban exploration really is coming from Asia in partnership with our Japanese partners, but also the team in China, and what you saw in Paris Fashion Week was a collaboration with a group called [indiscernible] and you are really innovative, it takes on some of our core heritage mountain jackets, long in lengths and all actually made through our technical standards. But what you see their Sam is, our ability to speak to a broad segment of consumers through that technical lens of The North Face, and making sure we stay true to the heritage and the performance, but also bringing the right product that allows that consumer to express themselves as they look at the brand individually.", "Samuel Poser", "Just the last -- and following up with that when do you see that expanding, when does that roll to the States and become sort of a broader, you talked about it -- sort of broader quote, you spoke about it at the Investor Day earlier in the year, in a general sense?", "Scott Roe", "Absolutely. So, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've got some stores that we're placing in Europe this year. We do have a test environment in San Francisco where our team there can really work with that store on a day-to-day basis. But I think we've really come to a point where we're comfortable with how the brand is expressed within a retail environment. We think that's something we can now pick up and move and you\u2019ll start to see that. We start our own D2C expression coming into all markets -- I mean a little bit bigger way in next fall. But there's an urban exploration component to each of our regions, the work that we do within our urban environments here in the U.S are in many ways coming out of that collection. But specifically, the Asian piece you'll see here more so next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.", "Bob Drbul", "Good morning. On the North Face, I guess the first question is, can you give us an update in terms of the trial that you're planning within a zone sort of where that stands today. ", "And the second question on the North Face is. With the Americas performance where it is, what do you think the inventories are for the North Face brand at retail, in the retail levels right now throughout the channels?", "Scott Roe", "Great. Bob, so take your Amazon question first, it\u2019s early. And I would tell you, we\u2019re being very thoughtful. How does Amazon fit into that integrated market strategy, this brand has, what\u2019s the right segmented offer that can be used within that environment to speak to the consumer and sell-through at the rates that both of us would like to see. ", "Early, it looks good. We\u2019re having significant progress in helping clean up the unauthorized dealers that are on that site and in many ways, have been some of the market pricing dynamics the brands dealt with. So, it\u2019s early, we\u2019re confident, they are a long-term partner, they\u2019re an important partner on a global basis for sure. ", "To your inventory at retail, it\u2019s relatively clean. And the outdoor industry specifically for the North Face has been on this venture for a little over 12 months, we exited last year better than year before. Retailers have really focused, along with ourselves on really bringing product to floor based on where the consumer is shopping for those particular product categories and ways of product. ", "So, we\u2019re very -- feel really good about, where the inventories are. We\u2019re feeling good about the flow of merchandise and it\u2019s really -- are looking at this year in a very positive manner versus last year. ", "I think if you were to contrast North Face, which is very seasonal and we\u2019re paying a lot of attention about the flow, contrast out with Vans, which is really a year round business, there is a lot of earnings from them, as well as Jeanswear on how we should be flowing specific to consumer demand that our North Face team has been tapping into and really now designing through these four territories specific collections based on each of the season and the given need and environmental conditions where the brand can really succeed. ", "Bob Drbul", "Got it. And I guess just, on the flow, when you think about the acceleration of the Vans business from Q2 to Q3, have you been able to adjust the inventory, the manufacturing plans to meet that high demand going into the holiday season?", "Scott Roe", "Yes. The short answer is yes. We have a relatively shorter lead time as it relates to footwear. We have a really well developed and diversified supply chain around those categories. And so, the other thing remember, part of this acceleration was in Europe, we saw in the first half, we were still fighting through some of those inventory and balances that have gone on for a couple of years and we\u2019re seeing the acceleration in the second half. We saw that comment, right. It\u2019s a little bit stronger than what we\u2019ve even saw. But for the most past, we saw it coming. So, we had our supply chain teed up. I would just give a call out. They\u2019ve done a fantastic job at meeting demands given this is a high-class problem to have, but it\u2019s a real challenge for those guys to keep up with it and I am putting our people up against to anybody in our industry, because they are delivering, right. We\u2019re meeting demand and we see it in the results. ", "Operator", "Next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please state your question.", "Jim Duffy", "Couple of questions for me. First, great strength in the D2C business, e-commerce is accelerating and the numbers imply positive comp at retail with the 1,500 some outdoors across the globe. Can you guys comment on what you\u2019re seeing with respect to traffic and conversion and maybe highlight some of the differences between regions and the brands?", "Steven Rendle", "Yeah, Jim you captured it well. our D2C businesses is strong and that\u2019s a big part of our strategic focus, it\u2019s where we are absolutely driving investments not only in creating that traffic, but investing behind operational scale. So, specifically your question on traffic, we are seeing with some of our businesses traffic up year-over-year, certainly see good traffic gains in our European business. But I think we\u2019re really getting the performance is on conversion in lot of advances going on to in-store productivity from having a right product at the right time in each of the stores to the quality of the sales experience and our ability to really service consumers quickly and efficiently. ", "So, it\u2019s really a combination of both, but I would tell you it\u2019s really that an operational piece, it\u2019s doing that in, we\u2019re also the investment that we\u2019re making in our one commerce platform that are allowing consumers to look at product online, purchase, pickup in store, return to store, we\u2019re just starting to really simplify and take the tension out of that that purchase decision across all of the formats and that\u2019s driving that traffic, that\u2019s driving that conversion in those results. ", "Scott Roe", "I\u2019d just add-on a little bit Jim to thinking about the numbers that you mentioned the 1,500 stores. We, a little more than a year ago came out with the slightly different take on our approach and we\u2019ve slowed the number of net openings, we\u2019re up -- we said about 50 that\u2019s more or less half of what we have been running over the previous years. But within that, we\u2019re still opening about hundred stores and we\u2019re aggressively editing our fleet based on performance. And part of what you\u2019re seeing also is the actions around just improving the quality of the fleet underneath the like-for-like initiatives that Steve just outlined. In fact, for the first time sequentially compared to the prior quarter our number of stores is actually down by two in the third quarter, up versus the year ago, but down by two compared to the prior quarter.", "Steven Rendle", "And then to build on that Jim. I mean the types of stores that our businesses are now looking to open, it\u2019s no longer sufficient to have a standard box that we move across the regions, it\u2019s being very thoughtful around what type of store based on the consumer and the market Vans opening a boutique in Brooklyn is a great example of tailoring a retail environment to build that connection, but also bring the right product to the consumer in the communities that they live. Each of our brands are looking at those smaller formats, the more street front locations, the mall locations and really modeling the appropriate type of store. And each of these stores really are starting to take on a smaller square footage increasing that productivity profitability.", "Jim Duffy", "Great. My next question is related with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in D2C and the challenges with some of the wholesale partner landscape. Is there any specific effort to deemphasize wholesale volumes or any categories or specific channels which you\u2019re deeming less strategic going forward? ", "Scott Roe", "Yeah. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m directly answering your question, but I\u2019ll just remind you as we laid out our view, we said, when you look at wholesale there\u2019s not a lot of wholesale growth on the net basis overall and really, we said, would be flat in North America with the wholesale growth coming outside of that, underneath that our digital wholesale growth is substantial. So, what that means is, we\u2019re expecting wholesale to be down low single digits in North America over the next five years. ", "But within that, Jim, we\u2019re winning with the winning formats. We have great customers that are big partners with us and they're growing, we're growing. There's others that are in a little more difficult position. So, yeah, we\u2019re moving our exposure to the more troubled areas. We're minimizing that, some of that through portfolio and some of that through just where we're placing our emphasis. But, in general, remember that hourglass of the distribution channels were generally focused on the top and the bottom portions of that -- of that hourglass because that's where we see the relative higher growth as we look over the next five years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.", "Ike Boruchow", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Let me add my, congrats. Scott, I think this is for you, so, it looks like you either hit or beat your plan within the Jeanswear closing for Q3. So, I'm just trying to understand what you see in Q4, maybe that causes you to be a little bit more conservative on that segment to that point. Can you help explain why Wrangler bounced back nicely in the U.S. while Lee worsened further from the run rate you saw last quarter?", "Scott Roe", "Yeah. So, first of all, as we said that is the best thing in this and in a couple of areas, it\u2019s tough for different reasons. But, yeah, Wrangler nice to see sequential improvement and we seem to be generally moving through the plan as expected, despite our [indiscernible] visibility. And I would say, no real change that situation. To be honest and in the Lee business we had a tougher than expected performance and particularly on the women's side. Our men's business is showing real strength, I think Steve mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We have a several styles and innovation that are really resonating but on the women's side, it's been a tougher picture for us. And based on what we see going forward, some of that is channel related, some of that is our own issues, frankly. But as we look forward, we took a more cautious view in the fourth quarter and partially reflecting in some of the results we saw in Q3 as well going forward.", "Ike Boruchow", "Got it. And there's a quick follow-up, Scott, I think you commented today, AUC was higher in the quarter, I think it's the first time you said that in a while, I think it was a tailwind to the first half. Can you just give a little bit more color about the dynamics on the costing side, where the inflation is coming, this maybe -- is that is ahead that we need to think about for next year?", "Scott Roe", "Yeah. So, if you remember, just zoom in back to the beginning of the year, we talked about -- we had some tailwinds from a cost standpoint through the first half, that turned to a headwind, starting in Q3 and going into Q4, we said Q4 would be the relative largest of the year. But, on balance, it was net zero and cost frankly isn\u2019t a real big factor for this year. So, also remember that we make commitments in arrears. So, when you're thinking about things like leather or cotton [loose], those commitments that we are seeing in the P&L today, commitments that were six months or so previously committed. ", "So, based on where costs are today, hard to predict. I wouldn\u2019t expect cost to be a major issue from what I can see right now going forward. But again, I caution you not to hover too much on those factors. ", "Just, it\u2019s a good reminder, as you think about currency and as you think about costs, we\u2019re looking at -- we\u2019re making longer term commitments, we\u2019re hedging, where it\u2019s appropriate and we\u2019re balancing all this into our merchandising and our pricing discussion. So, as we\u2019re balancing that mix, we don\u2019t see any fundamental change in the trajectory of our margins. And I would suggest that\u2019s the way you should look at it. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Please state your question.", "Mitch Kummetz", "Two questions. First for Steve, just on the Vans business, the wholesale distribution. I think you guys mentioned that Americas was up mid-single-digit. Did like recently kind of from, what I would call more traditional athletic retailers, they\u2019ve called out Vans as a strong brand for them. I\u2019m kind of curious how you\u2019re managing any expansion with those types of retailers. Any concerns with overexposing the brand maybe or alienating any more traditional accounts. If you are growing with those types of retailers?", "Steven Rendle", "Our Vans business is better than most. The thoughtfulness that they put into their distribution strategy and how they segment product across the different choices that they have. This is something that they spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about. We are in all of those great retailers that sell footwear, athletic footwear to the athletic lifestyle footwear. And we\u2019re not looking to aggressively open up doors. But I think we are very broad based in thinking about the Vans consumer, from the boutique consumer to the broader application and being very thoughtful around who the partner is, what are the right doors, what\u2019s the right assortment? And then really managing with our partner sell-through. So, we can keep the right level of newness flowing into those doors to continue to drive that forward growth. ", "Scott Roe", "And just going to add on, too, Mitch. If we, when we look at the numbers behind this growth, it\u2019s really broad based as Steve mentioned. It\u2019s by geography, it\u2019s by channels and it\u2019s by multiple product categories including apparel. So, it\u2019s really broad based, you\u2019re not see in one particular style or group that\u2019s driving the entire broad, the entire brand it\u2019s really broad based. And that\u2019s gives us confidence as we look forward. ", "Mitch Kummetz", "And then Scott on the D2C, from a margin standpoint. I know, you talked about it being a benefit to the gross margin. I\u2019m hoping, you could maybe elaborate on the impact from an EBIT margin standpoint. I mean in the quarter, essentially D2C was all your growth and I want to say, if I do my math right, probably digital was third or more of that. Is there any way you can kind of speak to the margin profile of D2C and digital from an EBIT standpoint, that way we can have some sense as to how that kind of impacts your overall operating margin on a go forward basis as I assume that you would expect that to continue to be a big driver of the top-line?", "Steven Rendle", "Yes. Particularly on the digital side and so we haven\u2019t disclosed our relative profitability, I\u2019d say there is never a lot of our profit growth in 2017 has come from our D2C as you can imagine and I\u2019m talking about operating profit. With that gross margin expansion comes SG&A as obvious as it relates to brick-and-mortar but remember we moderated our brick-and-mortar a bit, we\u2019re focusing on more on conversion in comp and we will continue to open stores just not quite at the rate as we have in the past, and we\u2019ve got specific focus on digital which is our single most profitable format that we operate. ", "So, as you think about it forward, it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m probably not going to fully satisfy you with you my answer, just know that from a return standpoint it\u2019s accretive when we look at our return on capital and again our fastest growing component to that which will continue to mix up is digital versus our most profitable format. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Rendle for closing remarks.", "Steven Rendle", "All right. Just really, quickly couple of things. As you all like to remember, Eric Wiseman will retire from our Board of Directors effective October 28. I would like to take a moment and again thank Eric to the leadership he\u2019s provided all of us here at VF. We owe so much of our past success to his vision and incredible worth ethic along with his thoughtful approach to leading his 60,000-person global enterprise. I\u2019m personally very thankful for his friendship and mentorship over our past 18 years together. Eric, if you\u2019re listening and I\u2019m sure you are, we all wish for your next chapter to be as exciting and fulfilling as the 22 years that you gave to VF. ", "So, with that, I\u2019d like to thank all of you for joining our call today. We are now nine months into our journey to transform VF into more agile and consumer centric enterprise. We are confident in our increased outlook and the momentum that we\u2019re carrying into the fourth quarter. Our core growth engines are delivering double-digit growth. Our gross margin is strong and our operating fundamentals are intact. We\u2019re thoughtfully investing behind our strategic roadmaps and we remain intently focus on delivering value to our shareholders. So again, thank you and we look forward to talking you all again in February. ", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to address the announcement this morning that we've reached the decision to sell the Nautica brand. While we do not yet have a definitive agreement, we are actively engaged with several parties and will update you as conditions warrant. I'd like to thank the Nautica employees for their hard work and dedication as we proceed through this process, and I'm eager for the Nautica organization to move into its next phase of growth and success.", "2017 was a transformational year for VF, highlighted by both moves, top quartile value creation, and meaningful progress towards becoming a purpose-led, agile, and consumer and retail-centric organization. In 2017, revenue increased to 7% to $11.8 billion, or 4% on an organic basis. Our big three brands grew at a combined rate of 8%. And on an organic basis, international increased 9%, led by strength in Europe and China, direct-to-consumer increased 15%, with 30% growth in digital, and our Workwear business increased 7%.", "Our fundamentals remain strong, as gross margin, a key driver of our value creation model, improved 160 basis points to 50.5%, a record for VF. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.98, including about $100 million of incremental investment to drive our strategy and accelerate growth. And finally, VF delivered a 43% total return to shareholders, including cash returns of $1.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases.", "As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm reminded of the commitments we made one year ago. We committed to investing in digital and as a result, we delivered owned and wholesale digital growth of more than 25%, which accounted for 55% of our total growth. We committed to distort investments toward our international platform and as a result, we delivered 9% growth, with international now representing more than 40% of total revenue.", "We committed to focus on Workwear and as a result, we consolidated our work brands into a single global platform and acquired Williamson-Dickie. We committed to being active brand portfolio managers and as a result, we sold LSG and are in the process of selling Nautica, and we've acquired Williamson-Dickie and reached an agreement to buy Icebreaker.", "And finally, we committed to being a more consumer and retail-centric organization and as a result, we grew D2C 15%, including 12% comp growth, and now D2C represents more than 30% of total revenue. And we directed a majority of the $100 million incremental investment at capabilities that enable our consumer-centric strategy.", "As we enter 2018, we will build on our early momentum and deliver on our commitment as value creators, responsible corporate citizens, and good stewards of our planet. Our top priorities for the coming year include protecting and enabling the explosive growth in Vans, while reenergizing growth in our Timberland and North Face brands specifically here in North America; successfully integrating Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker into VF; accelerate our consumer-centric transformation work, with a particular focus on increasing speed-to-market; and we'll drive operational efficiency and create capacity for growth to fund our strategic growth initiatives.", "To support the execution of our strategy and better enable the growth of our large global brands, we have realigned the roles of our Group Presidents and redirected our leadership talents at our most important objectives. Going forward, each Group President will be responsible for a single geographic region and have one global brand reporting to them.", "Reshaping the portfolio is the number one choice in our strategy and we were very active in 2017. Our commitment to active portfolio management is how we position ourselves to deliver top quartile returns, with an evolving portfolio of powerful brands that are strategically advantaged to win. The decisions we are making cement VF's position as a value creation company. Reshaping the portfolio will remain a top priority in 2018.", "I'd like to take a moment and recognize VF's associates around the globe. The pace of change in our industry is happening at an accelerated rate. To compete and win, our vision is to increase the metabolic rate of the entire organization and become more agile, nimble, and effective in the way we work. Our transformation agenda is in its early phases, but our associates have responded in typical VF fashion. Our success is not possible without the commitment and determination of our talented leadership teams globally. I offer a sincere thank you and I know we're all excited to build on our momentum and drive even stronger results. So with that, let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance.", "Beginning with The North Face brand, global revenue increased 6%, including a 3 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift discussed during our prior calls. Wholesale revenue increased 4% and our direct-to-consumer business increased 8%, including 14% growth in digital. While the growth in The North Face was below our outlook, we accelerated the timing of several initiatives to improve the quality of sales and reposition the brand back to its rightful place as the premium global outdoor lifestyle brand.", "During the quarter, less promotional activity, foundational investments in China to improve the marketplace and position ourselves for accelerated growth, as well as aggressive efforts to clear Amazon of unauthorized dealers, impacted results. These actions continued to improve the positioning of the brand in the marketplace and are showing up in stronger margins for both us and our partners.", "In 2017, The North Face team made significant progress against our strategic growth plan, and reported numbers clearly don't tell the whole story. To put context around the underlying performance of the brand and the progress being made, excluding lower off-price sales, the impact of cleaning up the Amazon environment, and the investments made in China, fourth quarter revenue growth was 8% when normalized for the order book timing shift.", "By region, revenue in the Americas declined 1%, as growth in direct-to-consumer, and particularly digital, was offset by a decline in wholesale due to the factors just mentioned. The fall 2017 release of the new Summit Series reflects The North Face brand's commitment to building the very best technical product in the world. The new range is specifically designed for athletes through a design theory of fast, light, essential, and was so impactful, it inspired the world's leading alpinist, David Lama, to join our brand. The L5 Proprius Jacket and the L2 Proprius Fleece Hoodie are prime examples of this theory and became the core athlete choices of the latest TNF expedition to Antarctica.", "The attention to this category will create a positive halo for the brand and influence design for the broader North Face assortment. The brand also saw Urban Exploration business expand nicely, with collaborations with Pendleton, Timberland, Vans, and Supreme, coupled with strong sell-through from its new Cryos Collection and the addition of the Asia designed Black Series Collection, which helped advance this important strategic brand extension.", "In Europe, the brand's strong momentum continued with revenue growth of 32%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the region. Wholesale revenue increased over 40%, led by deepening strategic partnerships in the region. Direct-to-consumer increased a mid-teen rate, including almost 30% growth in digital.", "The iconic Nuptse Jacket celebrated its 25th anniversary, supported by a Nuptse Forever campaign, which drove excitement in the Urban Exploration territory and buzz across Europe with 75% growth. Asia increased 8% in the quarter, including the negative impact of the foundational investments in China discussed previously. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 30%, driven by digital, which offset a decline in wholesale, as we aggressively managed inventory in the marketplace.", "2018 is off to a strong start for The North Face and we're pleased with the progress being made to elevate the brand. It is early, but we are executing our strategy and even more confident in our 2021 growth targets. As we look to fiscal 2019, we expect growth for The North Face to be in line with the 6% to 8% range we laid out at our Investor Day.", "Now to Vans, 2017 was remarkable year for our largest and fastest growing brand, highlighted by broad-based global momentum. Congratulations to the Vans team around the world for delivering record results. The brand has become the global icon of creative expression for youth culture.", "Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 35%, with strength across all regions, channels, and product franchises. Revenue in the Americas increased 38%, Europe increased 31%, and Asia Pacific grew 21%. Our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, both increased more than 30%, including more than 50% growth in digital. A special call-out to the Vans North America direct-to-consumer team, which became VF's first $1 billion regional D2C platform. The Vans North America D2C performance was incredible, with nearly 30% growth and a total comp above 20%, a job well done.", "Looking at product, the diversity of Vans' growth and the teams' Not Just One Thing mentality will sustain our strong momentum as we move into fiscal 2019. For the quarter, Classic footwear increased more than 25%, with continued strength in Old Skool and Slip-On styles. Progression footwear increased more than 20%, as the new UltraRange, All Weather MTE, and Pro franchises continued to perform well. The brand also delivered double-digit growth across apparel, and accessories. And our customs platform, a great example of creative expression, increased almost 200% in the quarter.", "The Vans brand is stronger than it has ever been. Retail inventory levels are in great shape and we remain disciplined with respect to inventory management, merchandising, and assortment planning. We're investing heavily to continue to fuel Vans' explosive growth. While the comps next year will be difficult, disciplined execution and a long track record of consistent performance give us confidence the Vans brand will deliver double-digit growth in fiscal 2019.", "Switching to Timberland, as expected, global revenue increased 8%, including a 5 percentage point benefit from the same order book timing shift that impacted The North Face brand. Wholesale increased 6% and direct-to-consumer increased 10%, including more than 30% growth in digital.", "In line with expectations, Timberland brand revenue in the Americas increased 5%. However, revenue declined 1% when normalized for the order book timing shift. Our diversification strategy continues to evolve, as strength from non-classic footwear and apparel, both of which increased at a mid-single-digit rate, offset by softness in our core Classic business.", "The performance of our SensorFlex and Aerocore platforms was particularly strong, increasing almost 50% in the quarter, and our Timberland PRO business continued to generate double-digit growth, with strength from our Powertrain Sport franchise.", "In Europe, Timberland brand revenue increased 14%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift. Our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses both increased at double-digit rate, including more than 30% growth in digital. Our locally designed product continues to drive demand, highlighted by our new women's collection, Courmayeur Valley, and Venice Park, which increased at double-digit rates. In men's, we had strong success with our Radford campaign and our Goose Eye Waterproof Parka collection.", "Timberland's Asia business increased 3%, with more than 50% growth in China, which was partially offset by softness in Japan. High-teen growth in our direct-to-consumer business, driven by almost 80% growth in digital, was offset by a decline in wholesale. The Ultimate Winter Boot with a SensorFlex outsole performed well in the region.", "Timberland's performance in 2017, while not at the level we've come to expect from this powerful lifestyle brand, was in line with our expectations. We are thoughtfully executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day. And as we move into fiscal 2019, we will begin to step our way into more sustainable and diversified growth. Over the past year, we've made significant investments and announced several organizational changes within the global Timberland brand, designed to foster more global connectivity and speed to market, drafting off the strong momentum we have in Europe and China.", "Moving to the Wrangler brand, as expected, global revenue increased 2%, with balanced growth across wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Revenue in the Americas increased 2% and our business in Europe grew 4%. Asia declined 7% due to ongoing weakness in India. While the destocking by our key customer is largely behind us and the initiatives put in place are showing early signs of success, visibility in the U.S. Jeanswear business remains low, and we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability.", "That said, we were pleased with the improvement in performance during the holiday period. And as we look to fiscal 2019, growth in profitability for the Wrangler brand in the U.S. should continue to improve. Our strategy to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail, continues to gain traction with core and new consumers. From a digital perspective, we're seeing strength across our digital wholesale partners as well as our own wrangler.com business, which increased double digits.", "Looking at product, collaborations with designers such as Peter Max are creating upper tier distribution opportunities, and consumers have responded well to new innovations, such as Wrangler Performance Series and Wrangler Outdoor, and our Wrangler Retro line continues to drive meaningful growth in these strategic brand extensions.", "Now to the Lee brand, global revenue declined 1%, as 11% growth in direct-to-consumer was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was about flat, with high single-digit growth in men's driven by continued success of our Extreme Comfort Khakis and Extreme Motion denim products was offset by softness in women's. We are encouraged by the improvement we're beginning to see in our women's business. As we enter 2018, continued momentum in men's as well as product innovation and expanded distribution in women's should drive improved results for the Lee Americas business this year.", "Lee Europe was up 4%, with balanced growth across wholesale and direct-to-consumer. The Sherpa Rider Jacket performed particularly well in the quarter. In Asia, revenue declined 5%, as mid-teen growth in direct-to-consumer was offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale, due in part to ongoing challenges in India. In China, the new Magma Fusion and Black Label collections delivered strong results.", "Now turning to Workwear, revenue increased 9% on an organic basis, marking the third consecutive quarter of at least high single-digit growth. Timberland PRO, Bulwark, and Wrangler RIGGS achieved double-digit growth, and Red Kap continued to accelerate as sector fundamentals improved.", "On a pro forma basis, Williamson-Dickie also had a strong quarter with 13% growth, driven by strength in lifestyle, international, and direct-to-consumer. It's been nearly five months since we acquired Williamson-Dickie, and the integration process has gone exceptionally well. Our integration and leadership teams have worked tirelessly over the past few months, and I couldn't be more pleased with our progress. I am confident that the creation of our Workwear platform and the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie will drive significant value for VF shareholders in the years to come.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Steve.", "First of all, for those of you on the phone updating your models, our sincere apology for what we've done to you, acquisitions, dispositions, year-end change. We talked about increasing our metabolic rate, and nowhere do you see that more than in the results that we see right now.", "It's been almost one year since we laid out a strategic plan at our Investor Day. As we reflect on the 2017 results, one year into our five-year plan, we know a few things to be true. First, 2017 has been a transformational year for VF, highlighted by top quartile value creation for our shareholders. Second, we've seen notable acceleration in Vans Europe and D2C, which allowed us to accelerate investments while delivering our commitments to shareholders. Lastly, while not all businesses are as far along in the journey as others, we're encouraged by our overall progress. In fact, we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be at this point in time, and that gives us confidence we're on the right path.", "Before diving into the numbers, let's review a few items that influenced our reported fourth quarter and full-year results. First, during the fourth quarter we reached the decision to sell the Nautica brand and determined it met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been adjusted. We provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding Nautica, so you can see the full impact on our results and on the outlook we provided last October. As a result of this decision, global Kipling results will now be reported within Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.", "Second, as a result of recent U.S. tax legislation, we recorded a $466 million provisional net charge in the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted our fourth quarter EPS results by $1.16. The provisional charge comprises an approximate $500 million transition tax payable over the next eight years for historical earnings generated offshore, partially offset by other items, including a favorable revaluation of net deferred assets as a result of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.", "Third, we incurred approximately $16 million of pre-tax acquisition-related expenses associated with the Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker transactions. These expenses negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by about $0.03. So, with that out of the way, let's review our fourth quarter and full-year performance. My comments going forward will focus on adjusted results excluding the items just mentioned.", "Our fourth quarter results were strong, as momentum continues to build across our core growth engines. Revenue increased 18% to $3.6 billion, well ahead of the outlook we provided last October. Excluding the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, organic revenue increased 10%, including an approximate 2 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift we discussed during prior calls.", "Revenue for our big three brands increased 15% on a combined basis, led by 35% growth in Vans. The performance of Vans globally has been incredible, and we're investing heavily behind our explosive growth to fuel continued momentum. And just to address a question likely on your mind regarding the sustainability of Vans growth, based on our current visibility, we expect high-teen growth from Vans through the first half of this year.", "Our Workwear business increased 9% on an organic basis, as sector fundamentals improve and we further establish our work platform capabilities and connectivity. On a pro forma basis, Williamson-Dickie had a strong quarter, with 13% growth compared to the prior year, driven by particular strength in international and direct-to-consumer.", "Total international growth accelerated 15% on an organic basis, led by 20% growth in Europe. And to once again highlight the broad-based strength we're seeing across our Europe business, our big three brands increased more than 20% on a combined basis. Wholesale increased more than 20%. Direct-to-consumer increased more than 14%, including more than 25% growth in digital. And, we again achieved double-digit growth across every major market in Europe.", "China remained strong, as revenue increased 10% on an organic basis, driven by continued strength in Vans, direct-to-consumer, and digital. Our direct-to-consumer business increased 16% on an organic basis, led by 25% growth in digital. Our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses increased at a high-teen rate. With a mid-teen total comp and a low double-digit comp in our brick-and-mortar stores, our focus and investment on elevating our direct-to-consumer platform and connecting more deeply with consumers continues to generate high returns.", "Wholesale revenue increased 6% on an organic basis, including a 3 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift. International wholesale remained strong, increasing at a low double-digit rate, and our digital wholesale accounts increased more than 20%.", "Now, as a reminder, our direct-to-consumer and digital wholesale businesses account for about 85% of our 2021 growth plan. So it's very encouraging to see the strong performance and momentum across key pillars of our strategy.", "We remain intensely focused on fundamentals and quality growth, as evidenced by continued strength in our gross margin. Gross margin was 51.6% in the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, gross margin increased 140 basis points to 52.4%. Gross margin was stronger than we expected as a result of more favorable mix and better full price sell-through, a direct result of our heightened focus on quality growth and inventory management. Gross margin expansion continues to be a significant value driver for us, providing the flexibility and opportunity to invest in our strategic growth initiatives.", "SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 250 basis points to 38%, which is above the outlook we provided last October. However, in light of our stronger-than-expected revenue and gross margin performance, we reinvested an additional $35 million back into the business to drive growth into 2018 and beyond.", "And just to breakdown our SG&A a bit further, the majority of our increase was driven by investments in direct-to-consumer, demand and product creation, and innovation. In fact, on an organic basis, our demand creation investment increased more than 20% during the fourth quarter, and you're beginning to see the return on that investment. When coupled with higher incentive compensation compared to a weaker performance a year ago, we've accounted for the majority of the change in SG&A.", "Relative to the initial outlook we provided last February, we invested about $100 million in 2017. These investments are focused on the core tenets of our strategy, direct-to-consumer, demand and product creation, design and innovation, insights and analytics, supply chain agility, talent and technology. We are transforming VF into a more digitally-enabled consumer and retail-centric organization. While this clearly comes at a cost in the short term, we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth and meet or exceed our long-term financial commitments laid out at our Investor Day.", "Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points to 13.6%, including a 30 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted operating margin was 14.1%.", "So to wrap up the P&L, adjusted EPS increased 13% to $1.01, $0.06 above the outlook we provided last October, including $0.06 of additional investment.", "Turning to our balance sheet, inventory increased 20%, including the impact of Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, inventory increased 3%. Our strong cash generation allowed us to quickly reduce leverage at the end of 2017, and our leverage ratio should decline further through the first half of 2018. Our balance sheet has capacity for additional M&A and it remains a top priority.", "So to briefly highlight the full year, revenue increased 7% to $11.8 billion, or 4% on an organic basis. Our growth engines continued to accelerate throughout 2017 and finished the year with strong momentum. The big three brands increased at a combined rate of 8%. On an organic basis, international increased 9%, direct-to-consumer increased 15%, with 30% growth in digital, and Workwear increased 7%.", "Our intense focus on fundamentals and quality growth led to 180 basis point improvement in gross margin on an organic basis to 50.7%. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.98, or 6% on an organic basis, in line with the high-end of the initial range we provided last February, despite an incremental $0.19 of investment. We made meaningful progress reshaping the portfolio, returned almost $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and generated a 43% total shareholder return. That's top quartile in the S&P 500.", "So due to a change in our fiscal year-end, our approach to forward-outlook is a little different this year. Our outlook for the three-month transition quarter ending March 2018 is as follows. Revenue is expected to approximate $2.9 billion, up 16%, including about a $200 million contribution from Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, revenue is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate, due in part to changes in FX. Adjusted EPS is expected to approximate $0.65, up 27%, including about $0.02 contribution from Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase more than 20%, due in part to changes in FX.", "Now, while we will not provide a detailed outlook for fiscal 2019 until our April call, let me provide a few preliminary comments relative to how we see the year shaping up. Revenue is expected to be up more than $13.2 billion, representing high-single-digit growth. This includes the expected contributions from Icebreaker and Williamson-Dickie. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $3.45, representing low double-digit growth. This also includes the expected contributions from Icebreaker and Williamson-Dickie.", "So in closing, we have strong momentum and our confidence is high. Our growth is accelerating and our core growth engines are delivering double-digit growth. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are aggressively investing in our largest and most profitable growth opportunities. We will use our early success to build on our momentum and continue to transform VF. We will continue to reshape and evolve our portfolio to deliver top quartile returns to shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress and on the next chapter of VF's value-creation journey.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up, and re-queue for any additional. Our first question comes from the line of Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the Jeanswear business. I think you've cited margin pressure as relating, at least in part, to launching more innovation at a time when pricing in the channel is more difficult. So can you maybe provide a sense of how you're thinking about the timeframe for margins to start to stabilize and maybe rebuild, and if that's contingent on future pricing? Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah, sure. This is Scott. I'll take that. Let me just set some context that \u2013 of what we said coming into the year. You know that our largest customer was going through a strategic repositioning of their floor and we did talk about putting some innovation \u2013 putting some make into the product without taking price, and that was a decision we made to try to defend our very large position in that retailer, and indications from NPD reports and others who are in that key male business that that has indeed been the case.", "But that, frankly, is not the largest contributor to our operating margin decline this year. It's really more from a deleveraging standpoint. As you think about gross margins going forward, there is always pricing pressures in that channel, but as the low-cost producer, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our gross margins.", "And from a cost rationalization standpoint, as we deleveraged a little bit, the team at Jeanswear is on it. They have plans in place, and I think you can appreciate we're not going to go into much detail on that, but we do see a path forward to restore profitability to Jeanswear over the long run. And as we look into next year, we expect to see improvements in operating margin.", "Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then just a quick follow-up on Nautica and the announcement this morning. I know you have a relatively new management team in place there and the performance in recent quarters had appeared to be starting to turn a little more positively. So can you maybe elaborate on the thought process behind the decision to sell and why this business might be a better strategic fit for someone else? And then also, your priorities for the proceeds from the sale.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Great. So this is Steve. I'll start, and Scott can finish. I would first start by saying, we could not be more proud of the management team that's in place at Nautica. Yes, we put some people in place early last year, but there was a good core team there as well. But we focused intensely on improving productivity, specifically in our retail outlet channel, and the team did just fantastic work building that foundation and shoring up profitability. They continue to look at driving product and go-to-market strategies to reignite growth.", "What brought us to this point of divesting of Nautica, we've talked a lot about the three lenses that we look at for our M&A activity. There's a strategic lens, there's a financial lens, and are we the right owner lens. And as we've looked continuously, this is not a one-and-done type action. This is something we're doing on a very proactive, very regular basis, evaluating all brands within our portfolio.", "But specific to Nautica, we came to a point where it didn't necessarily hit all of our strategic touch points financially. It was not in line with driving our financial aspirations, and we came to a point where we thought perhaps it would be a better owner that could unlock the value that this brand holds. So really hats off to our team putting us in a position where we can enter into the sale process and feel confident in driving a good result.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "I'll follow up. I think there was a question on the use of proceeds and how we were thinking about that. So coming off the acquisition of WD and the upcoming Icebreaker, our first priority has been to deleverage the balance sheet and get our credit metrics back in line, and that will be our priority in the short term. I think it's worth noting, though, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have seen a significant improvement around those metrics already, and we have a lot of capacity and we expect to be back in line as we get through 2018.", "Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.", "James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you, good morning.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Good morning, Jim.", "James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I have a high-level question and then a question on the preliminary fiscal 2019 outlook. So now that you're into the five-year plan, results from your direct-to-consumer and international have been particularly strong, and in aggregate, maybe the U.S. wholesale a little bit lighter than you had expected. Add in some acquisitions, subtract some divestures, and the mix shift is really evolving more quickly than you had foreshadowed. Scott, can you maybe help us with an updated picture of the U.S. wholesale as a percent of the global revenue mix as we enter fiscal 2019?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So I don't have that at the top of my head, but I guess you're right on your general comments. We are evolving the portfolio quicker, and you're seeing the impact on gross margin and growth rate. I guess I'd say as it relates to our long-range targets, we won't change them until we change them. At some point, we'll come back and give an update. I guess you're starting to see the payoff of what we said we were going to do in terms of where our priorities are, where we're trying to reshape the portfolio, in what direction, away from \u2013 if you think of that bell curve from a distribution standpoint, continuing to minimize some of the more disruptive parts of the market and focus on the top and the bottom, and we're seeing progress there. And also you're seeing it in our gross margins from a mix standpoint. So acknowledging that we're ahead of where we said we would be, at some point we'll come forward, but we're not prepared to clean that up at this point.", "And, Jim, we'll follow up offline specifically on your question on wholesale. I just don't have that at the top of my head.", "James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Fair enough, and then a question on the fiscal 2019 outlook. Recognizing that's a preliminary view, it does seem the underlying assumptions for organic growth are very modest embedded in that. Can you unpack that a little bit please? And I'm thinking about FX and the contribution of the acquisitions.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So I guess what I would say is the momentum that we see coming out of 2017 through the stub and into 2019 is essentially intact. It's right in line with what we guided for our 2021 plan. Yes, we are going to see some benefit from currency. It looks like at this point there are a couple points maybe of benefit from FX. But from our standpoint, the other thing is, you think about Vans, we talked about where we came out of 2017 with our Vans growth rate. We gave you some shaping. I'd like to say we're going to continue to grow at that rate forever. That's probably unrealistic. But we do see continued momentum in Vans, even if a little \u2013 not quite as strong as what we saw in 2017. So that's part of what you're seeing as you look forward into 2019.", "James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I had a question, Steve, for you on The North Face business. It came in, obviously, a little bit weaker than we all thought. You outlined three specific impacts to the growth. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the Amazon piece in particular? I'm curious what you're learning about from your 3P test step brand there. And then, also I think you gave a preliminary 6% to 8% North Face growth for fiscal 2019. Just curious what's underpinning the confidence in that estimate. Is it where the order books are trending? Just any help around how you think about the shape of that growth into next year.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Great. So let me first, Erinn, just say,\\ we are very confident about our North Face business. We entered last year \u2013 we were pretty open and honest with you all with where we saw our brand in its journey and in the work that needed to be done. And there has been significant work going on internal in that business, specifically around product creation, demand creation, evolving our D2C and digital platforms. But also a big part is how we've looked at really shoring up and strengthening the brand in the work that we've done on Amazon, the work we pulled back on off-price, and some of the actions we're taking in Asia, are all about rebuilding that strong foundation that this brand has become accustomed to operating on.", "Specific to Amazon, great partner, we're about five months into what we kind of titled a test of working with them directly. We have a dedicated key account leader and team now here in the United States, really mirroring what we've done in our European platform. But really investing the time and resources to understand Amazon better, help them understand us as a provider and a brand, and then collaboratively going out to clean up the unauthorized dealers, which a tremendous amount of work went into that this fall. I would like to tell you we're done. I don't think you're ever done, as you're constantly policing that environment, but I would tell you, we have a good partner that's very committed to working with us in a collaborative way to bring our brand to life in this aspect of our distribution.", "I'll tell you what's giving us confidence about the 6% to 8% really are some of the product proof points that you see coming through. I mentioned in my prepared remarks around Summit Series. We've seen just a complete re-ignition of energy in the specialty channel, in our own D2C. We've seen it across the globe, and the impact that the focus on Summit Series and very specific ideas around design, innovation specific to performance, but really unlocking design that people are attracted to, color stories, and performance features that we see having a direct impact on the balance of the line as we've really shored up the pinnacle.", "The Urban Exploration piece that was so strong in Asia, a big part of our results in Europe are driven around the Urban Exploration, particularly the Black Series. Our early reads here in the United States are equally strong. The interest in collaborations with the brand is another proof point. But just as we go out and launch marketing campaigns, the online digital piece and the connections that we're getting with consumers, all of that kind of adds up to us confidently stating 6% to 8% growth rate for next year.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. And if I can just ask a clarification for Scott, just on the $3.45 EPS guide for fiscal 2019, is that constant currency, or does that \u2013 or are you including currency in there? Thank you.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "That's all in, Erinn.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "And just as a reminder, too, Nautica is treated as discontinued operations, so Nautica is not included in that number as well. And from an FX standpoint, just to clarify a comment I made a little earlier, so we do see some FX benefit on the top line in the transition period, in the stub. As you look at fiscal 2019, it really is not much of a factor from a revenue standpoint. So my comments were related to the stub period on the earlier question.", "Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, guys.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Erinn.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Erinn.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Pretty impressive growth in EMEA. Can you parse out what's driving the growth in EMEA? Are there any design and marketing takeaways that can translate to driving growth in the Americas? And then specifically for 2019, any high-level thoughts on how we should think of the U.S. versus abroad results for 2017?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Yeah, Laurent, I'll take the EMEA, kind of what's driving that. Scott can unpack the second part of your question. The growth in EMEA is really, it's broad-based. Every one of our businesses is doing extremely well. We have exceptional growth coming from North Face and Vans, but I also would call out the efforts that are going on with our Napapijri business, and really the incubator concept that we've given to that brand to try out new ideas that we are able to then scale across our larger businesses. Some of those are around the creative brand vision work that we're doing and how that's impacting the clarity of design, not just a product, but demand creation.", "Our Napapijri business has been growing double digits here for a few quarters and continues to show great strength. But more importantly, it's where we are testing new ideas that are having positive impact as we scale them to the larger brands. So Europe is really broad-based. All of our brands do extremely well. They're focused on key account management, D2C productivity, and really the growth now on the digital area, not only our own platform, but with some of our partners like Zalando, really it's a balanced approach to driving the European growth model.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, and any high-level thoughts for 2019, fiscal 2019, versus U.S. and international?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "We'll see the U.S. accelerate versus the 2017 rate, as we see some of the recovery and progress being made, that Steve mentioned earlier. But we do see continued strength in Europe. They're really not missing a beat. I always have to point out too, the profitability and efficient tax platform we have in Europe makes, the fact that this business is growing, has momentum, an even bigger weapon for us going forward.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great. And then a follow-up question is, in terms of the stub quarter's guidance, I just want to be sure this is excluding Nautica. And should we assume the $427 million in revenues were evenly split by quarter, and then the same thing for the EPS? And then the last question is, how much are you expecting to spend on Icebreaker?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Boy, that was a lot of questions, Laurent.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Wow, okay.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Sorry, guys.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So again, I think the first part of that was related to Nautica. So Nautica is excluded from all of our guidance and our actuals, and I think you'll find in the materials that were provided, we restated historical numbers so you can see that. Remind me that you had a weighting question.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Is it evenly split by quarter, the revenues and the EPS contribution from Nautica?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "More second half weighted due to their D2C business. So again, I think you'll find that offline we could clean that up, but because D2C is a big part of their business, that tends to be a drag to the first part and they see relative better performance in the second half.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "And then a question \u2013 yeah, sorry, you asked a question \u2013 were you asking around accretion or what was the question relative to?", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Yeah. How much do you expect to spend on Icebreaker? Any high-level thoughts on EPS contribution for the year?", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yeah. So we haven't disclosed the amount on Icebreaker at this point. As you think about the contribution, it's about $150 million business, which means our total Merino business is in that $300 million range when you include Smartwool. As you can imagine, in the first year of acquisition from an accretion standpoint, it's going to be minimal, but it will be accretive in year one.", "Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Thank you very much, and best of luck.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning. I just have a couple of things. One, just to clarify on The North Face and the U.S. wholesale business, this is a matter of cleaning up distribution and I think, Steve, when I saw you in Denver, you mentioned like some of the better guys are starting to come back to you. Is that sort of what it is, that some of your better accounts may have backed off because of the distribution, and now that you're cleaning it up, you expect it to come back the other way?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "It's a couple of those. I might characterize it slightly differently. Yes, we put a tremendous amount of effort in pulling down the promotional part of the brand that we've seen the last two to three years. That's not only in the wholesale channel through tighter inventory, but also within our own D2C environments, all to really put the brand back onto a much higher quality and we're seeing the results in not only our profitability, but in our partners' profitability.", "I think it's fair to say that we did have some dealers kind of moderate their assortments with our brand, but I would tell you it was as much what was going on in the broader marketplace, which we were part of, we weren't the only issue within the promotional environment that hit the outdoor industry.", "But I would also tell you, and we've been pretty honest about this, is our product offer wasn't necessarily giving those better specialty dealers all of the reasons to invest their open buy with us. We're seeing that turn. I think you saw that energy in Denver, and it takes time to kind of refill that pipeline. But I think that is exactly why we remain confident and are putting that 6 to 8 percentage growth for 2019 out in front of you all today.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So, Sam, if you just put some numbers around that, it would be 1 to 2 points higher base if you normalized for reductions in off-price, lower promotional activity, the cleanup of Amazon that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So the underlying trend is a bit better. But we're really seeing that payoff in our margins. You see that in our results, and also really focusing on our dealer and customer profitability as well, because that's really the key to the long-term growth for our business.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I've got two-and-a-half things more. One, the Urban Exploration, part of that business is coming to the States. What's the timing there? Two, how do you foresee the tax rate going forward? And three, in your preliminary guidance for fiscal 2019, is that a situation where the investments remain strong and you expect ongoing gross margin improvement?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "So, Sam, I'd love to answer that tax question, but I'll let Scott go with that one. I'll take your Urban Exploration. Some of the exciting parts of that line that are coming out of Asia, China, and in Japan are here today. The Black Series is in market and you'll see it continue to grow. And there'll be some really exciting aspects of some of the GOLDWIN line, really leveraging that partnership that you'll see coming into not only in this market, but also the European market, as we really spend time understanding the importance of the Urban Exploration assortment, what are the right offers across the different points, the distribution that that consumer shops in, and leveraging the global product offer, not just Asia, but there are some exciting things are coming out of Europe that we see driving that growth. And there's things coming out of our U.S. team, the Cryos Collection is here, so it's really unlocking that global design talent and tapping into what that consumer is looking for and placing the right product in the right points of distribution.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "All right. I'll take the other parts of your question. So tax rate, maybe I would just make a broader question, because I know it's on a lot of people's mind, tax reform, what does that mean for us? I guess, the first answer is really complicated and a lot of moving parts. But we're comfortable enough to make the provisional \u2013 record the provisional amounts that we talked about in the prepared remarks. As it relates to the ongoing rate, one thing to keep in mind is, we already had a pretty attractive rate. Our rate was in the high-teens and really very much benefited from our foreign rate.", "So if you look at what tax reform did to us, our domestic earnings are getting a tax benefit from the lower \u2013 the 21% rate. Offshore, with the GILTI and BEAT provisions, it actually is a bit of an increase for us. Even though that's recorded on the U.S. side, it's related to foreign earnings. And when you net it all together, it's a very modest benefit. It's almost back to the starting point from our overall business. So it is modestly beneficial, but doesn't move the needle much and really doesn't change anything as it relates to our long-term assumptions.", "On the other hand, the access to cash is a big deal. So, because now that 40% of our business is offshore, it's a very profitable business for us, the ability to repatriate that cash just got a lot easier. And for us, going forward, that's going to be a good thing.", "As it relates to fiscal 2019 guidance, I think there's a question about how do you think about margins and investments, right? So, obviously, we're not going to give guidance in detail, but a few shaping comments. There's no reason you shouldn't expect gross margin to continue to expand based on those mix benefits that we talked about, that 40 to 50 basis points of mix. You should be able to assume that that's going to continue.", "As it relates to investments, the way we think about investments is from a long-term perspective. We laid out our plan in Boston. We said these are the areas that we think are important, that will create a defendable long-term position of advantage for us in a very disruptive marketplace, and we're serious about investing over the long term.", "And the way we're thinking about it is the shareholder gets the first bite of the apple. We're going to meet our commitments and we are meeting our commitments according to our long-range plan. On the other hand, where we see opportunities to advance against our investment roadmaps, we'll also take those opportunities. So there is continued investment that will come, although we said in our long-range plan, the investment will be more front-loaded in that five-year period and will start to be a lesser factor as you go forward. And as the top line increases, you'll start to see more leverage as time goes on.", "One other just housekeeping item, don't forget WD. As WD comes in next year, that is dilutive to our gross margin. So my 40 to 50 basis points is really relative to the organic business. There will be some offset due to the mix of WD coming in, as you saw this year. You can assume a similar kind of impact as you annualize the impact for next year.", "Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you very much.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Hey, Camilo.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Scott, if you could, just provide a little bit more color on the Nautica impact to the quarter, because by my math, it's about $0.03 to what the fourth quarter would have been. And then how does that contextualize for your fiscal 2019 guidance? I'm just trying to figure out what the apples-to-apples comparison is versus \u2013 the preliminary FY 2019 guidance versus what I think we have all been looking for modeling.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So your $0.03 is about right in the fourth quarter; about $140 million of revenue. And I've got Joe sitting right next to me here. We're going to clean this up. I think in the restated \u2013 since we're going disc-ops, in the restated numbers you can see where we were and where we are now. So the impact of that should be transparent by quarter. We can take that offline if you want to clean that up a little bit. But I think we provided everything you need in order to get the answer by quarter. Joe, you're welcome to add anything to that if you want.", "Joe Alkire - VF Corp.", "No, that's right.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. And then I guess just thinking about the commentary on North Face, the actions taken to improve the positioning of the brand, I think you said it was 1 to 2 points. That was a global number, right, if we exclude all those numbers? So if we were to back that into what the North America growth rate would have been, would you care to comment on what that could've been?", "Joe Alkire - VF Corp.", "Camilo, it's Joe. So for The North Face North America business, those impacts primarily reside in North America. So relative to the 1% decline that you see, that number would be up at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Got it, perfect. And my last question, Steve, really goes back to Vans and the exceptional growth that the brand has enjoyed over the last year or so. You talked about protecting the brand. You talked about not letting it overheat. What does that mean to how you're going to manage the brand into the wholesale channel and your DTC, right? Are you going to constrict some of the deliveries into the wholesale channel? Are you going to limit some of the inventory across the channel? Are you going to segment the styles further? How do you plan to maintain a double-digit growth rate, as you alluded to, so that this doesn't roll over, like we've seen other brands do in the not-too-distant past?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Good question, Camilo. In my prepared comments, I talked about not one thing as part of the Vans strategic approach to their marketplace. And you can see it in where the growth is coming from, from Classics, but also some of the new collections, the UltraRange, the new Mountain series. We see growth in apparel. We see growth in the accessories, but we're also seeing great expansion into the Customs platform. So it's a broad-based \u2013 not one thing, but an intense focus on the right amount of newness, the frequency of new drops.", "But we've said this before, our Vans team is really the benchmark business on how they look at product segmentation across the different consumer touch points that we have to sell into, with our stores being the most premier expression of our brand. They're really evolving how they're looking at using stores and coming up with a mix of formats that play into the specific communities across the globe, but being very thoughtful, and direct partnerships with those wholesale partners, placing the right amount of inventory, being very thoughtful about not having one style over-torque, but really having it be a balanced approach with the right amount of newness to keep the brand moving forward each season. So they are the benchmark business for us. A lot of what our Vans team has learned and does, we move across the entire enterprise.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Is it fair to say that you're getting a new consumer into the brand as opposed to your existing consumer that's buying multiple pairs relative to what they had been buying before? And if that is true, you guys do a ton of consumer work in understanding who that consumer is. How do you maintain or how do you dig deeper with that new consumer, if that in fact is what's driving the incremental growth rate?", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "There is for sure a new consumer entering this brand, and our team is focused on that creative expressor and understanding what those touch paints are and the things that are important to that consumer, being able to really bring that to life in all of our digital communications within our platform, and then all the different mediums that we have available. We spend a lot of time understanding our consumer, our investments behind data and analytics specifically in the consumer area, being able to evolve our messaging from broad-based to now very individualized conversations, to really make that consumer feel unique and special and being able to offer up what we believe through our data science what that next appropriate item is for them to add to their collection of Vans product.", "Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Got it, guys. Thanks very much and good luck.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Thanks, Camilo.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, hi. I wanted to clarify a couple things about the commentary about the fiscal 2019 outlook. The first thing I know, Scott, you said about $3.45. I just wanted to clarify the base for that. I think it's in the range of $3.12, but I wanted to confirm that.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "Yes, you're right, $3.12 is \u2013 you're in the zip code.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. My question then is that would be about 11% growth, which I know is in line with your long-term targets, but you will be having the Dickies contribution plus I think maybe some favorable currency margin impacts. So I just wanted to drill down why the underlying growth might be below the long-term target.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "So we'll unpack that, obviously, and give you the details. Currency is actually not a huge impact for the 2019 number. But I would say when you look at the underlying organic growth, you're right. It is right in line with our overall long-term growth plan. And we'll give you more visibility into what exactly the contribution is from Dickies when we come back in April.", "I would just point everybody back, remember where we are point in time on this five-year plan, right? We're one year in, and this is a period where we talked about relatively modest growth, which we're tracking a little bit ahead, and that's true both from a top and bottom line. So that really is what's shaping our long-term view. We're taking a long-term view as we think about the evolution of both our earnings profile, as well as the decisions that we're making, and that will give you a pretty good guidepost as you think about what to expect going forward.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And last clarification just if I could on Dickies. On the fourth quarter itself, I think it attributed or added $0.04 in earnings. I think you had said $0.02 coming into the quarter. So was that operating over delivery or was that some sort of tax benefit for the domestic business there? Just trying to clarify what drove that and if it has any implications going forward.", "Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.", "It's really operating and it says we got it a few things a little quicker than we thought. But from an overall standpoint, gives us a little more confidence in our forward plans, but it's not materially different. They had a good fourth quarter. We said international and their retail actually was very strong in the fourth quarter, and that really drove a lot of it, as well as getting at some costs a little bit earlier.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Rendle for any closing remarks.", "Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.", "Great. Thank you, everybody. Just a quick recap. We're coming off a transformational year for VF, highlighted by our top quartile value creation for our shareholders. We are very encouraged by our progress. I think we've been very open and transparent with where we are and where we intend to drive this enterprise. And today, we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be.", "As we move forward, just be reassured that we have an intense focus on our brand portfolio, one, the shape of it, but also helping drive the brands to achieve their maximum potential with our focus around product, demand creation, elevating our D2C and our digital, and leveraging our international platforms to drive growth. We will continue to accelerate our investment around becoming more consumer and retail-centric. We see this as foundational to us evolving as an enterprise specifically for our consumers, where we come to life on our own D2C and digital platforms, but will also enable us to be an even better wholesale partner to our wholesale trade across the globe. We will continue to be intently focused on operational efficiency and creating capacity for growth, while being very, very attentive delivering to our shareholder commitments.", "So thank you for being with us today. We're excited to continue our conversations in the quarters to come.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
