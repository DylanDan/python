At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Lori, and good afternoon. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today.", "All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. Finally, please note that we issued a second press release this afternoon announcing the close of the acquisitions of Cigital and Codiscope.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, as we delivered solid double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenue was $653 million, notably above our target range. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.94. We are raising annual revenue, earnings per share, and operating cash flow guidance, reflecting our confidence in our outlook. In addition, we continued to return capital to shareholders with a $100 million share repurchase; Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "The market that we serve through our three customer segments of Semiconductors, Systems and Software Developers remains mostly unchanged since last quarter. In semiconductors, analyst predictions are more positive than in past quarters, reflecting the investments going into the early products in the Internet of Things, machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure, and the continually growing need for more compute power in the cloud.", "Fundamentally, though, the dynamics have not materially changed, as companies continue to prioritize aggressive adoption of advanced silicon and state-of-the-art design, while being mindful of their need to control costs. The consolidation drive to combine forces in order to better attack certain markets or more effectively utilize resources is likely to continue. Many of these consolidations have worked their way through the system, and while they are a headwind, Synopsys has fared well. The technology leadership and completeness of our solutions, combined with unwavering support, has made us a highly valued partner. In fact, the strength of our design, verification and IP platforms positions us well with customers readying themselves for their next wave of growth.", "Moving to systems companies, which represent about 40% of our revenue, the intersection of hardware and software is at the core of both their needs and our ability to deliver value. It\u2019s hard to overstate the promise and the challenges brought by the new applications that are emerging as the age of \u2018smart everything\u2019 is taking shape. Helping our customers de-risk as they bring all the pieces together has now become our joint challenge. This is precisely where Synopsys excels. Our broad portfolio, proficiency and problem-solving experience, reaching from Silicon to Software, continues to increase in value as the challenges grow more and more multi-dimensional.", "Our third customer segment \u2013 software developers across many industries \u2013 is a growing differentiator for Synopsys. The expansion of interconnected devices \u2013 with immense software content and complexity \u2013 brings with it the need to find security and quality vulnerabilities early in the development process. Fixing issues by sending out a stream of software patches is now untenable with systems that touch human life, society\u2019s infrastructure, all the way to high-value industrial and financial systems.", "Our growing portfolio of software security and quality products and services is gaining attention in market segments that, only a few years ago, we would never have touched, ranging from embedded to enterprise.", "Now to some Q1 product highlights spanning from Silicon to Software. Through our most advanced design tools, we are well-known for supporting adoption of 16, 14, 10, and 7 nanometer FinFET technology. With our advanced lithography and TCAD platform, we are also well engaged in the development and research of 5, 3, and 2 nanometer nodes.", "For example, we teamed up with IIT Bombay to announce an important extension of our Sentaurus TCAD for FinFET reliability modeling at 7 nanometer, 5 nanometer and below. Meanwhile, adoption of advanced design with our tools continues unabated.", "Of the 300 FinFET designs completed to date, Synopsys was relied on for more than 95% of those chips. Significantly, 55 of the 56 tape-outs at 10 nanometer and below were completed using Synopsys. Overall, our digital design platform, which is centered around synthesis, place and route, and sign-off, continues to make great strides.", "First, our leading synthesis franchise around Design Compiler, which benefits from an extraordinarily strong and broad usage base, is seeing a rapid succession of technology advances and runtime improvements, including in its ability to deal with advanced test requirements.", "Second, our state-of-the-art Place and Route offering around IC Compiler II is benefiting from very rapid adoption, including 19 of the 20 top semiconductor companies; Better and better results and solidity by honing the product on more than 250 production designs covering now over 25 different foundry processes. And as a result, we are seeing notable successes in head-to-head benchmarks and customer engagements.", "And third, the strength of our gold-standard sign-off franchise. In addition to a continuing drumbeat of technical improvements, the strong correlation between the design and sign-off tools is a massive risk-reducer for our customers while impacting their time to market.", "During Q1, for example, we released PrimeTime HyperScale, which reduces timing sign-off runtime and compute costs by 5 to 10X. The adoption is swift as market-leading companies such as Broadcom, Juniper Networks, MediaTek, Renesas Electronics and Samsung Electronics have already deployed HyperScale in their signoff and tape-out flows.", "The sharing of physical sign-off algorithms from IC Validator, natively inside IC Compiler II, also greatly improves sign-off time as it minimizes physical design violations during, instead of after place and route.", "In custom/analog design, adoption of Custom Compiler is steadily progressing. In Q1, a market-leading mobile fabless company deployed Custom Compiler on multiple 7 nanometer designs, while a large semiconductor IDM is replacing our competition for the design of a growing number of custom IP blocks.", "Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth. Verification is a showcase of our broader Synopsys Silicon to Software vision. Our focus is squarely on the greatest enabler of the IoT/Smart Everything age: the intersection of hardware and software verification.", "The center of our offering is our VCS simulator franchise. The product is not only doing well business-wise, but also delivering great new technology advances. During the quarter, we announced the roll out of massive parallelism natively integrated in the next release of VCS.", "Advanced customer-partners are already experiencing substantial performance boosts as this technology further cements our commitment to best-in-class verification products. Our hardware-based ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping had another strong quarter as well. The combination of increasing customer demand and our ability to deliver the fastest solution on the market today, gives us confidence that our verification business will do very well again this year.", "On to our IP products, where we continue to deliver strong results and gain customer recognition. Strength was across the board, with notable wins in 7 nanometer and continued momentum in IoT. A major Chinese customer selected Synopsys for a wide range of IP for their 7 nanometer designs. TSMC certified our area-optimized USB 2.0 solution for IoT for its 40 nanometer Ultra Low Power process. The ARC SEM security processor won the Linley Group\u2019s best processor IP award for 2016, based on power/performance efficiency, as well as unique security features.", "Our IP group is growing well. This is the result of more than 15 years of investment and hard work, yielding an unmatched portfolio of high-quality, trustworthy IP products. These characteristics are particularly important in the expanding automotive space \u2013 a key focus segment for Synopsys, touching our IP, EDA and software security portfolios. Our customer base in automotive continues to widen, including new semiconductor companies as well as OEMs and noted Tier 1 suppliers.", "In Q1, a high-profile automotive semiconductor company adopted our test solution for use in mixedsignal automotive ICs to enable ISO 26262 compliance. Their ICs are for safety-critical systems and therefore require in-system and power-on self-test to comply with the standard. Key elements of our EDA, IP and Software Integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety measures defined by the ISO 26262 standard. Which naturally leads me to our Software Integrity group.", "Succinctly stated, our focus is to provide products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain. Clearly, security challenges are only increasing, but so is the recognition that finding and fixing security vulnerabilities must be addressed vigorously while developing the software. That means high-quality code-checking long before the software gets deployed is a must. For example, Online Trust Alliance, a well-known industry organization, states that 100% of recently reported IoT vulnerabilities could have been easily avoided if manufacturers and developers took security and privacy measures into account throughout the development process.", "Our strategy is to: First, broaden and deploy our Software Sign-off Platform. Second, accelerate our penetration of key verticals in both the embedded and enterprise spaces. And third, drive demand creation, with services, ecosystem partners, and certification projects. While it\u2019s early, we are making great progress: 8 of the top 10 software companies in the world are now Synopsys customers; So are 7 of the top 10 automotive OEMs; And, illustrating the TAM-broadening potential for Synopsys, so are 16 of the top 20 commercial banks in the world.", "Having greatly tuned our channel in fiscal 2016, we continue to invest in this promising business. In Q1, we launched a new version of our static analysis tool with enhanced security for mobile and web applications. It\u2019s designed to help provide enterprise-level security analysis and broad programming language support necessary to address today\u2019s many evolving application security demands. In Q1, we further broadened our language coverage, by adding support for Fortran through a small acquisition. While arguably an older language, it\u2019s a very important legacy component in many oil and energy systems.", "And, of course, in Q1 we closed the acquisitions of Cigital and Codiscope, a pivotal move to expand our market through a services arm that lets us reach and engage with higher-level decision makers at a broad set of customers. We see Synopsys and Cigital as an ideal combination: Synopsys leads with best-in-class products; Cigital with high-expertise services. Synopsys has a very strong presence in the embedded space, including automotive, medical devices and IoT; Cigital is a leader in serving enterprise customers, with particular strength in financial services.", "Synopsys is eminently engineering-centric, while Cigital brings a demand creation element, with customer touchpoints earlier in the security strategy development process. Thus far, the integration is proceeding well, and we had our first taste of the potential of the combination just this week at RSA, the world\u2019s largest security conference, where Synopsys highlighted the most comprehensive software security solution available today.", "In summary, we exceeded expectations in Q1 for an excellent start to fiscal 2017, and we\u2019re raising our full-year guidance. We\u2019re seeing very good momentum with our EDA platforms, continued strength in our IP portfolio, and good growth in Software Integrity as we continue to invest and broaden our TAM in this very promising emerging market.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m very pleased with our strong start to the year. In Q1, we continued to build on our momentum from 2016 as we achieved financial results that exceeded our expectations across all key metrics. We posted double-digit revenue and earnings growth, expanded operating margins, and generated considerable cash flow. In addition, we returned $100 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Based on our excellent Q1 performance and confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, earnings, and cash flow.", "Now to the numbers: As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 15% to $653 million, with strong results across the entire product portfolio. The upside relative to our target range was due mostly to timing of hardware sales and IP consulting deliverables. 90% of revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.8 years, and we expect the 2017 average to be about 3 years.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $556 million, which includes a restructuring charge of $12 million, part of our plan to align resources to position the company for long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $477 million, slightly below our target range. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 27%, driven by strong top-line growth and better-than expected expenses.", "For the year, we expect solid margin expansion over 2016 when the modest dilution from Cigital and Codiscope is excluded. GAAP earnings per share were $0.56. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.94, above our target range, due to strong operational execution and the timing of hardware and IP revenue. We generated $47 million in operating cash flow, even with the outflows from our 2016 annual incentive compensation payments.", "Collections were very strong, reflecting some large payments that came in earlier than expected. We are raising our 2017 target to a range of $500 to $520 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $966 million, with 16% onshore, and total debt of $320 million. In Q1, we returned $100 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. In 2017, we intend to slightly reduce share count, and we have $335 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Now to the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. For Q2, the targets are: Revenue between $665 and $680 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $560 and $579 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $507 and $517 million; other income between negative $1 and $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.59 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 to $0.88 per share.", "For 2017: revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion, a growth rate of 6.5% to 8%; other income between $2 million and $6 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $2.01 to $2.12 per share; we\u2019re raising the mid-point of our non-GAAP earnings target range by $0.04 to $3.21 to $3.26 per share. Capital expenditures of about $100 million; and cash flow from operations of $500 to $520 million.", "As we look to the remainder of 2017, we now expect total revenue to be skewed to the first half of the year due to the timing of hardware and other deliverables. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share will be higher in the first half. Investors should expect continued quarterly variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware business and its upfront revenue recognition.", "In summary, in Q1, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, and generated solid cash flow. Based on our excellent Q1 performance, strong Q2 outlook, and confidence in the rest of the year \u2013 we are raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, earnings, and cash flow. Lastly, we will continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of shareholders through an appropriate combination of investing in the business to drive sustainable earnings growth and returning capital to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Let\u2019s start out with sort of the order or magnitude of your guidance for 2017. You beat in first quarter by almost $15 million. You\u2019re raising the midpoint of your guide by $10 million for the full year and your full year guidance implies that the second half of the year is nearly 5% lower than the first half, where typically it\u2019s normally the inverse of that. Is that sequence of fiscal year quarters purely a function of up-front hardware revenue recognition? Or are you simply trying to be a little bit conservative as we start out the year?", "Trac Pham", "Hi, Gary, this is Trac. You\u2019re heading the right direction. Certainly when we entered the year our plan was, from a revenue perspective, certainly skewed more in the second half versus the first half of the year. What we\u2019re seeing in Q1 and what we\u2019re seeing in our outlook for Q2 is that the profile of both hardware and IP has skewed towards the front half. So that\u2019s affecting the profile. Overall we still feel \u2013 in fact feel better about our outlook for revenue this year despite that profile.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay. Aart, we\u2019ve seen some re-acceleration in semiconductor sales after what has been basically three flat years in overall semiconductor sales. I think we are now topping year-over-year to the tune of close to 10%. So outside of any of the impact from consolidation in the industry, are you seeing a more buoyant environment as it relates to IP and EDA licensing? Or is it still status quo with EDA revenue expected to grow somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 4%?", "Aart de Geus", "In general, when the customers feel that they have a good year, everybody is a little bit more pleasant to deal with, as you would expect. At the same time, I\u2019ve said many, many times that the growth rate of the semiconductor industry in aggregate over multi-years is really about 4% to 4.5%. The fact that from different years there can be big swings, is more a function of individual product lines and rhythms within the buying market than anything else. Nonetheless, though, I think if there is one positive I would take out of this, is that the predictions that we\u2019ve made now for of a number of years that electronics would bring about a wave of new opportunities through this whole notion of a smart everything, you can also call it machine learning or digital intelligence, is starting to become visible.", "I think that is very exciting because if you have something that\u2019s a little bit smart, the one thing you want it is to be smarter. And one way to make it to smarter is to give it more compute power. We can see that the pressure and the push for advanced nodes is very solidly driving this notion forward and it\u2019s becoming increasingly real. All you have to look at is how immensely powerful automatic driving cars are, and yet how immensely far they still have to go before you can completely trust them. That\u2019s all good news for us. It\u2019s in that context that the combination of hardware is getting better leads to software that is much more performance. That leads to applications that really, I think, will wow us in the years to come. I think there is a little bit of that in this picture as well.", "Gary Mobley", "Thank you for that. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. I\u2019d like to sort of revisit the question about the front half loading of the year, in particular on the hardware side. I think when you entered fiscal 2017, or at least on the last call, you talked about how you\u2019re taking a cautious stance with respect hardware because of the difficulty in predicting sort of the timing and magnitude of hardware in a given year. Now that it looks like you\u2019ve got the year pretty well set with a very strong first half, curious what your thoughts are on the second half. Might that come in stronger? Or do you feel like you\u2019ve kind of got the funnel pretty well set and you wouldn\u2019t really expect the second half hardware funnel to sort of build up further from here?", "Aart de Geus", "In many ways you answered your own question. You said at the beginning of the year we were cautious because we felt it was fairly difficult to predict a part of the hardware waves. And you were right because we have not predicted such a strong Q1; and the fact that Q2 is a strong follow up is only encouraging. But it\u2019s also true that we want to remain cautious. That when you look at in aggregate, raising a year is a big year when you do better early in the year, but many things can happen. There\u2019s no indication of bad news, it\u2019s just that we are digesting the good news, I think, at a slightly slower clip than being too aggressive.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. I wanted to talk about the software integrity business. One, you\u2019ve had close to a quarter of having the acquisitions under your belt. I wanted to get your impressions of how they are fitting in and how they are integrating in. And then just talk about where you are in your sort of longer-term goal of creating this software signoff platform and what other pieces, if there really are any meaningful pieces that you think you\u2019d need to get to that goal?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. I think we have \u2013 it was close about halfway in the quarter. So far, the integration is, on both sides, a lot of learning while making sure that we continue to execute well. And I can state that the execution appears to be on track based on the plans that they have. But the opportunity really is how does, in this case, one plus one really be more than two, in that the services can help accelerate a broader adoption of the tools. Because the services tend to interact with high levels, in the strategic levels, in a company. And how can the tools be a wonderful add-on to a service business that is already quite performance in some of the market segments, most notably the financial services market segment.", "Having said that, I don\u2019t want to minimize at all the challenge of that learning because Synopsys fundamentally has been a product Company more than service Company. We, of course, have a very large support force that service requires a certain set of behaviors. We are step-by-step broadening the Cigital capability on a world-wide basis, which is a great opportunity, and at the same time making sure that both teams are well educated on the offerings that we have. I think we are well on track to create something that is stronger again. That belief is bolstered somewhat by the fact that the non-Cigital part of Synopsys, of SIG, did well again.", "And I think we have alluded to that the last few conference calls, that the predictability of that business, the number of large deals, was on a very good track. And so that gives us a degree of solidity that gave us additional courage to make this move.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Aart.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We have a question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes. Good afternoon. Maybe one more question on the linearity of the year. What is the current \u2013what are the current lead times for some of the hardware systems that you have? And how long ahead of time do you typically get those orders?", "Aart de Geus", "Well. The lead times really at this point in time are only a marginal issue because typically we can execute within a quarter or so. Now of course if an order comes in late e in the quarter then typically it would not have much impact revenue-wise in that quarter. Regarding the linearity, of course I understand that many of you are trying to handicap how good the rest of the year looks. I think what we\u2019re fundamentally communicating is that our guidance at the beginning of the year turned out to be more conservative than the first quarter delivered and therefore we made some changes. But we are maybe a conservative Company, or fundamentally we try to execute to what we say we will do. And that\u2019s why after the first quarter we don\u2019t want to change guidance too much.", "Having said that, run rates grew again. I think we have many customers that are actually quite interested in the emulation part of the business, in the prototyping part of the business, because they\u2019re going more and more into the hardware-software part of the space that determines their time to market. And so it\u2019s well possible that the second half of the year turns out to be strong. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have visibility to that. Yes.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay, that sounds good. And then you had some comments earlier about your simulator coming online here pretty soon. Does that close the gap at all with the emulator? Or is it still a very distinct market for each of those?", "Aart de Geus", "These are quite distinct markets because they have different catches both in speed but also in the ability to debug and look at things. At the same time, one of the very strengths that our verification platform has, is that it can be used very much as a continuum. Meaning that one can do parts of the design in the VCS software simulator, one can do part of it in emulation or in the prototyping boards. And we will continue on that track, because if we can execute well on that, while each one of these products from version to version will get faster again and higher capacity, the fact that they work well together is actually an asset for Synopsys.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. Great. When I look out a few years, in my mind the big drivers, digital drivers of IP, the China IoT market, automotive and software integrity. Curious if you think those are the three biggest drivers that you have and the relative strength do you think of each?", "Aart de Geus", "Well. As you were listing them, I kept thinking about all the other products that are positively impacted too. Because while things like IoT, machine learning, automotive are going growing very rapidly, they pull with them an unbelievable need for more capacity and everything that connects to the cloud, to a massive amount of computing and therefore the bandwidth and the storage that goes with that. I think that is why, as much as a lot of people call this the age of internet of things, the internet of things is almost more a catalyst to growth in all of these other dimension than anything else.", "Now if you look at our products, there is no question that some of the products that have done particularly well happened to touch the areas that you mentioned. And so IT is particularly relevant in people that want to very quickly do complex systems where they don\u2019t want to build all the blocks themselves. And our IP blocks have literally been honed over many, many years and are constantly pushing the state-of-the-art. I mentioned already the verification of this intersection between hardware and software.", "For us the promise of the software space, we originally got into that by realizing that software complexity was starting to rival hardware complexity, and that the penalty for errors was rapidly moving up. Penalty for errors in hardware has always been high. Software, as I said, you could get away with patches. But that\u2019s not the case when the software drives things of very high value all the way to cars and human lives and so on.", "And so you amend that with the very fact that there is a world of hacking that really with nothing good in mind. You can see that the need for high degrees of discipline in the software space is a necessity, even if it will take some time before development flows get there. And so that is the mission that we are on. While this is a new market, it\u2019s particularly rewarding now as we start to see that we are interacting with companies that literally five years ago we would never have dreamed of talking to. And we\u2019re talking insurance companies, health companies, banking consortia, and so on. And these are all people that use software and use it in the context of very high-value propositions. So they need to be safe and they need to be efficient.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay, great. Trac, when you look at some of these new drivers for the Company, does that fundamentally change the model over the next few years as they become a bigger percentage of the overall mix?", "Trac Pham", "The emulation, Tom?", "Tom Diffely", "Like software integrity.", "Trac Pham", "Oh, software integrity.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes.", "Trac Pham", "Certainly, as we \u2013 and that\u2019s factored into the overall mix. We\u2019ve talked about that segment growing in the 20% to 25% range we are cognizant of how that grows as an overall mix. And so when we talk about the long-term growth rates and earnings growth rate, that\u2019s factored in.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then finally, when you look at some of the impressive numbers you have, 19 of the 20 top semiconductor guys for placement, how much of those positions are sold positions versus shared positions with other employers?", "Aart de Geus", "For many, many decades most positions have always been shared in various ways. There are a few that are sole positions or there are a few that where one or the other company is massively dominant. But we are in field where constant advances are constantly being explored. And we have been very fortunate to do very well in this. But our investment continues to be at the high speed and to race forward. Customers will look at anything that helps them but they are also increasingly benefiting from the collaboration that comes out of fairly deep long-term relationships. Yes.", "Tom Diffely", "All right. Thanks for your time today.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re most welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Krish Sankar with BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Yes, so thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of number one hard to track. If you look at your last quarter, did your EDA software revenue come down year-over-year? I\u2019m trying to figure out, because given we\u2019ve been talking quite a bit about digital share gains and I\u2019m trying to see if that is actually impacting the numbers quite yet. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive situation and if EDA software revenue is down? And then I had a follow-up.", "Trac Pham", "Krish, revenue is actually up. When you look at the year-over-year comparison on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s actually up very healthfully, 8.5% year-over-year and then 6% on a trailing 12-month basis.", "Krish Sankar", "Okay, all right. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive situation you are having?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, we compete intensely for this market that continues to push hard and in some cases accelerate their need for technical advances. And so as you know, there are not that many players in our field. And so it\u2019s a healthy and good thing that we are both pushing hard. Synopsis has had the benefit of having a portfolio that is both well-anchored and quite complete and increasingly very well integrated in platforms that are helpful for the customers time to market and risk reduction.", "All of these are probably statements that some of our competitors would make about themselves as well. And we never underestimate them, but we are both providing tools that are sort of similar to race cars, the faster they go, the better for the customer.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. And then, can you give us an update on like \u2013 all this like FASB ruling that\u2019s coming up, that\u2019s being implemented next year? Looks like some software companies are moving away from ratable model, but the EDA companies and a few other security companies seems to be believing that the ratable change will not impact them. Can you tell us where you stand in that spectrum and what gives you confidence the ratable model will continue? Thank you.", "Trac Pham", "Hi, Krish. You\u2019re referring to 606, the new revenue recognition rules. We have been working on this for a number of years and working closely with our auditors as well as the regulators. And first of all, let me remind you that this won\u2019t take effect for us until FY2019, so there\u2019s a lot of time for us to implement it. But right now, based on the work that we\u2019ve done, we feel very confident that most of our ratable models should stay in place.", "Krish Sankar", "Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Just one moment, thank you. Mr. Vleeschhouwer, we\u2019ve got your line open, please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay, thank you. Aart, I\u2019d like to ask you about future growth potential within specific parts of core EDA, but excluding hardware, and where you might possibly see some positive inflections. There are times when there are certain categories within EDA that foreseeably might grow or grow again. If you go back a few years, four or five years, it was fairly foreseeable that the PCB category would see a reinvestment or retooling cycle, which it went on to do for a number of years.", "You are not in that but just making a point about some predictability in this space. Implementation has seen some renewal, obviously, with ICC and Cadence\u2019s business there. So when I think about your references to DC and VCS and signoff, those are for the industry altogether about $1 billion of total EDA revenue. So I\u2019m wondering if, after a fair number of years of somewhat flat results in those categories, there might not be in any or all of those, some new inflection over the next number of years?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think at a macro level, if you look at all of these products taken together, they\u2019re fundamentally anchored at least to a large portion, not entirely, in the semiconductor industry. Per an earlier question, notwithstanding the year-to-year differences, the semiconductor industry has had a fairly steady growth rate and with steady R&D expenditures, and therefore fairly steady EDA growth all in all. Within individual product groups, and especially when you connect them together in coherent platforms, there are actually very big changes in products in a matter of two to three years as on moves to the next generation.", "And these changes invariably are around finding a way to dramatically improve one of three characteristics. Either characteristics of the quality of results, meaning the power of the chips or the performance of the chips, or the time to results, meaning make the product run much faster, or the cost of results which is reduce the area of chips. These evolutions are not linear because often you work for two or three years on a set of profound algorithms and then suddenly it makes a difference. If you look at a little bit higher level, and this is where sort of intersects with the strategy for a Company, the big inflection points from my perspective have been the addition of the IP business to EDA.", "And this, of course, now already quite a number of years ago but now it is a significant portion of our business. I\u2019ve alluded the last couple of years to the inflection that is coming with the addition of the software side of hardware-software. And it\u2019s not a surprise that so many of the verification expenditures are increasingly focusing on that. And then we have predicted that the software side itself would go through this by virtue of the complexity growth.", "And so that is how we are looking at our opportunity space. And to the earlier question of how does our financial profile evolve, be it in growth and profitability, while we\u2019re managing Synopsys as a portfolio of a number of specialty areas that are very related but somewhat independent in their growth spurts. And in large arrangements with customers, the allocation of the individual revenue streams can be somewhat fuzzy just by virtue of accommodating how the customer wants to look at it. I\u2019m not sure I completely answered your question sharply, but I did give, I think, what I think are the big things that actually bode well for us for a number of years to come.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Second question with respect to software integrity. At the investor luncheon in New York back in October you made two interesting points about that business. Number one, that you were seeing or would expect to see more large deals in that business. So the question is if you are in fact beginning to see that?", "And secondly, that business would necessarily have a services component to support customers pre- and post-sale and so forth. You addressed that with the Cigital acquisition but the question is, do you think that makes you sufficiently capacious in services? Or do you think you need to do more building, organically or otherwise, in services to support the SI business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, listening to my predictions through your mouth, I almost feel clairvoyant because indeed the deals did get larger. And that\u2019s not surprising because this is the same history as EDA many years ago or many other fields where automation and verification takes hold. And yes, it takes hold faster with people that look forward and so on. But really it happens very often when people have a catastrophe or an issue to deal with. On the services side, you\u2019re right, we mentioned that then.", "And to be honest, I don\u2019t recall if we were completely engaged with Cigital at that point in time already. But we have felt for a while that the issues around security are so large that when you get the opportunity to talk to, let\u2019s say, the CIO or CSO or CTO of a large Company, and they tell about all the security issues, the next answer is, well, we have this one product, why don\u2019t you just buy some, feels pretty shallow.", "In that context, the Cigital acquisition was great because these are people that are accustomed and knowledgeable about reflecting the broader picture than advocating what is sort of a good approach for the Company to deal with it, while not necessarily pushing for individual products. But of course, now highlighting what we have. And so in that sense, I think that we will first learn how to run that business well. And assuming that goes well, my guess is that this will broaden more and more on a world-wide basis.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thanks for taking my question. My first question is related to your recent law suit against ebiquity. And secondly, if you can talk about how big of issue is policy of software for you.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, if you don\u2019t mind, we don\u2019t want to talk about individual legal situations, so let me more generalize. From time to time we obviously see glaring cases of misuse of software. And we try to respond forcefully but gracefully to it. It is always better if we can guide a customer towards a healthy long-term solution, if I can call it that. Every thoughts and that\u2019s more difficult and maybe legal situation is resulting from that. We\u2019ve had a few of those in the past, they have been resolved, I think, professionally and positively. Let\u2019s hope this yields the same.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. My second question is in regards to just the overall China market. Are you seeing like increased growth in \u2013 coming from China design companies? And just in relation to that, why isn\u2019t your Asia-Pacific revenues as a percentage of mix not growing?", "Aart de Geus", "If you looked at our distribution of revenue over many, many years, you would see that Asia-Pac for decades has been growing substantially faster than other parts of the world. Asia-Pacific itself has multiple components and Taiwan and Korea have been big parts of that for many years. In the last number of years China has grown immensely, and of course the potential to continue to do so.", "Simultaneously, we know by virtue of having been in China since really the early 90s, how the competence of the engineering teams and the companies that have grown and some have merged and have grown again, have progressed quite superbly. And so in that sense, a number of companies that do state-of-the-art design in China just like anywhere else in the world. We have been very fortunate to be, I believe, the largest contributor to that from an EDA space point of view.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And then my last question is on the competitive dynamics, Krish talked about it earlier. But just \u2013 can give us a sense of like where are we in terms of adoption of IC compilative? And do you think that can be a driver of share growth for you? And also if you can touch on the on the IC Compiler on the custom side.", "Aart de Geus", "IC Compiler II has seen, actually, an enormously rapid adoption rate which continues. And which is solidified more and more by the fact that we are also getting increasingly excellent results, especially when used in conjunction with some of our other tools. And so from that perspective, while I certainly don\u2019t want to be negative on any other competitive products, we have a high degree of competence and confidence, I should say, in this product line and we expect it to continue to grow.", "Your second question was on Custom Compiler. There too, this is a smaller product, less visibility and typically a slower adoption rate by virtue of the longer history that people have in the custom space. And our focus has been primarily in the more advanced node, the FinFET technology. And we are seeing some very good adoption, especially in the last few quarters. So we will continue to watch this space.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jason Celino", "This is Jason on for Monika. Thanks for take my questions. My first question relates to maintenance and service revenue. I\u2019m showing that it\u2019s up 20% quarter-over-quarter. Is there any reclassification of revenue in this?", "Trac Pham", "No, Jason. The maintenance and service line should reflect the strength in IP. And then, in this quarter when we completed the Cigital acquisition, that business should flow through that line as well.", "Jason Celino", "Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then my next question was to the stock buyback. How are you guys thinking about doing the rest of the $325 million for the rest of the year?", "Trac Pham", "As I said, we will look at what\u2019s necessary to bring the share count down to the guidance range. And we continue to evaluate whether or not it\u2019s expense to do an ASR or an open market. But that remains to be determined.", "Jason Celino", "Okay. And then my last question, with Siemens buying Mentor Graphics, have you seen any change in competitive dynamics in the market? Do you see competition increasing, decreasing because of the acquisition?", "Aart de Geus", "For starters we certainly don\u2019t underestimate what the change can do for Mentor. I certainly can not say that we\u2019ve seen an increase in competitiveness. But let\u2019s see what the future brings. It\u2019s a very capable Company with very capable products. Maybe if I can toot our own horn, I think that we are \u2013 we have very capable products too, and increasingly a lot of our top customers reflect on the strength of our platforms. And that will certainly be a continued angle for competitiveness in this regard.", "Jason Celino", "Great. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mitch Steves", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. And I guess, I\u2019m going to look at the linearity, not from a top-line perspective, but for operating margins here. Typically the back half you get a lot of operating margin expansion, so I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re essentially saying that the operating margins will be down on a year-over-year basis in the back half.", "Trac Pham", "Hey, Mitch, this is Trac. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. We typically don\u2019t see it necessarily increasing through the year. And it will vary depending on the profile of revenues and that could flow depending on hardware or IP services. And then throughout the year, what we\u2019ll see is the change in variable comp as it \u2013 particularly on the commission side as it ramps up depending on shipments. So I would not interpret that as something \u2013 a longer-term trend.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. And then one quick follow-up. On the IP business in your software investment, it should be growing materially higher than kind of the rest of the Company. So I\u2019m curious if this means for the next couple of years here, that you will see revenue re-accelerate if it\u2019s going to come down in the back half?", "Aart de Geus", "I\u2019m not sure if we understood the question. You are saying that we will see the software business and the IP continue to grow well. And what was the question attached to that?", "Mitch Steves", "Right. So, essentially if the back half comes down low single-digits by the implied guide, will you then re-accelerate because of a much higher mix of essentially software assets and IP?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, if you\u2019re referring to the profitability part, obviously these businesses as we grow them, we also have in place a discipline to make them gradually more profitable. And the question is always when you have something that grows very fast, is it better from a \u2013 both competitive position, growing the value of the Company over time, to push on growth or on profitability. That decision gets made sort of on a continual basis. But fundamentally we follow a belief system that says once a business starts to grow, it also has to increase it\u2019s profitability. And so while the high-growth businesses are less profitable than the lower-growth businesses, in aggregate I think we\u2019re actually in a very good balanced portfolio situation.", "Trac Pham", "Mitch, let me just add to Aart\u2019s comments. I would not take the second half of the year and annualize it in any way or extrapolate off of that. We are very comfortable with the overall business and the growth that we said we\u2019ve identified from core EDA, IP and software integrity. And those trends, I think, remain intact. They shift from the back half to the first half of the year is really the timing of the hardware and IP. But overall, I think you look at business over a multi-year trend, those growth rates that we previously communicated for each of the segments remain intact. Does that help?", "Mitch Steves", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And I\u2019ll turn it back to our speakers. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I guess we have reached the end of the hour. Again, thank you very much for attending the earnings call. We had a very strong quarter and we look forward to Q2 with a fairly high degree of confidence and a strong year as well. And as usual, we will be available for the after call phone calls.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call will include commentary regarding our Q1 fiscal 2014 results and also the definitive agreement to acquire Coverity, both of which we announced this afternoon. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results, our expectations about the timing and likelihood of closing the acquisition and about the potential benefits of a culmination. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, today\u2019s earnings press release and our press release announcing the definitive agreement to acquire Coverity. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m happy to report that we began fiscal 2014 with a strong Q1. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, we made excellent progress preparing for a number of important product announcements over the next couple of months, and half an hour ago, we announced Synopsys\u2019 entry into the software quality, testing and security tools market through the acquisition of Coverity. Before introducing you to this major move, let me first summarize our results. We delivered revenue of $479 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59. For the year, we\u2019re tuning guidance on the revenue side, raising operating margin and reiterating our non-GAAP earnings per share targets. Our guidance excludes any impact of the Coverity acquisition. Looking at the semiconductor landscape around us, there is remarkably little change in our customers\u2019 cautious behavior. While there are clearly a number of companies that are doing noticeably better than others, on average, the various confidence metrics continue to show uncertainty while technology advances continue unabated. These economic and technical challenges drive companies to be cautious in their spending, demanding in their needs, and in some cases, to consolidate their businesses with others for efficiency and market position. While none of these pressures are new, the length of this period of uncertainty is notable in light of the continued intense drive for state-of-the-art design to meet unforgiving market windows.", "Fortunately for Synopsys, the technical and time-to-market pressures make great EDA and IP solutions absolutely essential for success. In Q1 we were the beneficiary of this trend, with one of the top global fabless companies increasing its spending with us through a substantial broadening of product adoptions, which brings me to some highlights, starting with core EDA.", "From a technology perspective, our leadership in advanced design, including FinFET transistors, is evident. As we\u2019ve often reported, we track the first 450 to 500 designs at each emerging process node. This quarter, we see 20/22 nanometer designs increasing somewhat, and a definite acceleration of activities at 14/16 nanometer, driven by the quest for substantial performance, low power and area benefits. Our design platform is relied on for nearly 90% of the 20/22 nanometer and below projects. This is not by accident, as our TCAD 3D simulation of process and transistor devices is used well ahead of these technologies becoming available to the design community. This early modeling information, an increasingly comprehensive collection of IP, ranging from logic libraries, to memory blocks, to advanced interfaces; and a complete set of digital and analog/mixed signal design tools, makes Synopsys the solution of choice for FinFET design. Indeed, through our customers, we see how FinFET-based chips will impact a growing number of products entering the market in late 2014 and significantly in 2015. This rapid advance in chip complexity brings enormous challenges to designers, but also to the core design tools. Please stay tuned this quarter for Synopsys to launch a major new capability in design tools. The outcome of many years of work, we have demonstrated excellent results with early partners, and I\u2019m looking forward to discussing the impact later in the quarter.", "Moving to verification, we see an even bigger need for solution breadth and productivity increases. Be it in simulation, emulation, prototyping, verification IP, or debugging, the complexity challenge is growing faster than Moore\u2019s law. With approximately 70% of advanced digital designs counting on Synopsys tools, and virtually all of the top semiconductor companies relying on our analog circuit simulation, we\u2019re driving a very promising solution. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve made excellent progress towards building our next-generation verification platform based on both organic development and acquired technology. This quarter, we intend to roll out our long-term verification vision, introduce two major new products, and deliver a unique set of productivity improvements resulting from our massive integration investments. Now to IP and systems, where demand is strong. In Q1, we launched a number of new products, including an ultra-low power, non-volatile memory for internet-of-things applications, and a multiprotocol 12-gig SERDES for the data center market. In the Ultra high-definition TV space, Realtek, Synopsys and UMC announced first-pass silicon success of an award-winning chip utilizing Synopsys IP, tools, and professional services.", "Meanwhile, our customers continue to adopt our USB solutions, which are now shipping in many millions of chips. For example, Microsoft uses our USB 3.0 IP in the Xbox One game console. In an industry first, we also demonstrated the next-generation USB 3.1 controller at CES in Las Vegas. It delivers end-to-end transfers of 10 gigabits per second. This is twice the data rate of USB 3.0. Our customers will be designing the new USB standard into products over the next year, and as contributors to the development of the spec, we already have IP ready to go at these early stages. As mentioned earlier, our FinFET footprint is rapidly widening, with releases of key FinFET optimized IP titles at several foundry processes. As we grow in IP, customers are signing up for larger and more wide-ranging agreements and several that include some technologies still in development. Because of this, as well as the timing of orders in 2014, we\u2019re seeing a slightly different profile than planned of how and when IP bookings translate to revenue. This results in a small amount of 2014 revenue now being scheduled in 2015, and while our annual bookings plan remains unchanged, we\u2019re tuning our \u201814 revenue outlook slightly down.", "Consequently, we\u2019ll drive ops margin slightly higher and maintain non-GAAP EPS guidance. From a multi-year perspective, we continue to see IP and systems as a low-double-digit growth space. On the system side of this business, our FPGA-based and virtual prototyping products did particularly well during the quarter. While rewarding, this is not a surprise, as many of our customers are significantly increasing their focus on the simultaneous development and verification of hardware and software. Which naturally brings me to the very important announcement we made today. Synopsys is entering the emerging software quality, test, and security market. While this market is directly adjacent to our present position, it simultaneously extends to customers that Synopsys had no interaction with in the past. Today, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Coverity, the leading provider of software quality, testing and security tools. The $375 million transaction, which is approximately $350 million net of their cash, will be funded with a combination of U.S. cash and debt. Subject to HSR regulatory review and other customary conditions, we expect to close the transaction in our fiscal Q2.", "Coverity fits well with the Synopsys high-tech, customer-obsessed DNA. Its 300 employees have built a solid business, with 2013 revenue of approximately 75 million in a recurring revenue model, and an average growth rate of 20% per year. The acquisition is important for two reasons: First, it\u2019s a natural adjacency and expansion of our total addressable market within our existing customers that are seeing growing amounts of software embedded in their products, and an ever-increasing number of engineers dedicated to that task; Second, the market for software quality extends well beyond the semiconductor industry to all software developers in all industries, thus opening a long-term growth opportunity beyond our existing customer base, in a fast growing market we don\u2019t address today. Let me quantify the opportunity. IDC today places Coverity as number 1 in the Software Quality Analysis and Measurement market segment, currently at approximately $500 million, with estimated 2017 market revenue of nearly $1 billion. We believe the increasingly complex development and deployment environments, including mobile, cloud, and embedded, could drive the CAGR to 20% or more in the next few years. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, today\u2019s electronics are differentiated by a combination of chip design and, increasingly, software. Semiconductor companies today typically hire more software than hardware engineers, and the importance of software goes well beyond the semiconductor space. With more than six million professional software developers in the world writing at least 60 million lines of code every day, productivity, quality and security tools serve a rapidly growing market.", "Traditional techniques for testing code, many of which have not changed for decades, are no longer sufficient. In that regard, Coverity is a leader in a new age of software development tools. The company spun out of a Stanford research project 10 years ago, pioneered a disruptive technology that finds defects by inspecting the code itself, rather than running the code and waiting for bugs to appear. This allows developers to fix quality or security defects early in the process. Since early fixes are relatively cheap compared to discovering defects in final quality assurance or, even worse, shipping defective software, the economic benefit of this technology spans cost, quality of end product, and time-to- market. Coverity has built an impressive customer base, large, global companies such as Adobe, SAP, Samsung Electronics, Citrix, Dassault Systems, Panasonic, Raytheon, Expedia, and Comcast use Coverity today. Its customer base of more than 1,000 includes; nine of the top 10 software companies, eight of the top 10 global brands, six of the top 10 semiconductor companies, and seven of the top 10 aerospace and defense companies. As a matter of fact, Synopsys itself has been a Coverity customer for almost a decade, and for the past several years, we have mandated that Coverity be run on all of our software.", "Bringing the two companies together has the potential to create incremental revenue opportunities in a couple of ways; one, through increased sales to current Synopsys semiconductor and systems customers. While these customer logos overlap, Coverity tools are sold to different buyers and different budget. Two, using Synopsys\u2019 broader reach and brand to increase penetration in industries new to Synopsys, and where Coverity has only just begun to serve; applications software, financial services, banking and trading platforms, government services, and basically any industry using software to power their operations. In addition, we see a pathway to expanding even further into this space, and building a substantial presence over the years, similar to what we did first with EDA, then IP. Coverity will be managed by John Chilton, one of our most senior executives who is well known to many of our investors, and who built our IP organization from the early stages. We\u2019ll integrate Coverity carefully into Synopsys, taking advantage of opportunities to leverage Synopsys\u2019 reach, while utilizing the already-successful practices and perspective of the Coverity team. In summary, we delivered strong results in Q1. During Q2 and through the next 12 months, we\u2019ll be launching compelling new technology in both core design and verification. And we\u2019re excited to embark on our new journey as we complete the acquisition of Coverity.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to, Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year of 2014, and provide some financial details of the Coverity transaction. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. As Aart highlighted, in the quarter we continued to execute well, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. In addition, business levels were strong. We repurchased $55 million worth of Synopsys stock and our balance sheet remains healthy. Total revenue increased slightly to 479 million, well within our target range. About 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for just over 11% of first quarter revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.6 years. We continue to expect average duration for FY14 to be approximately three years.", "Turning to expenses, Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were 419 million, which included 28 million of amortization of intangible assets and 18 million of stock-based compensation. Q1 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were 370 million, down 6% sequentially and slightly below our target range, driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses, including some delayed hiring, along with overall cost control. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter. For all of FY14, we currently expect non-GAAP operating margins to increase over FY13 levels by about 100 basis points. We continue to focus on operational efficiency and this year we will adjust our planned expense levels slightly to achieve our targeted FY14 non-GAAP earnings. Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.59, which was above our target range. So now looking at our cash flow, as expected, there was a Q1 net operating cash outflow of 74 million, due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments. We continue to target operating cash flow of 425 million to 450 million in FY14. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $98 million. During the quarter we purchased about $1.4 million shares of Synopsys stock for $55 million and we have approximately $445 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 893 million, with 32% onshore and 68% offshore. DSO was 47 days and we ended Q1 with approximately 8,690 employees, with about one third in lower-cost geographies.", "Now turning to the Coverity acquisition. As Aart mentioned, we anticipate funding the acquisition with a combination of U.S. cash and debt, the specifics of which will be determined over the next several weeks leading up to the close. Coverity generated approximately $75 million of revenue in 2013, is roughly breakeven on a non-GAAP basis, and is slightly cash flow positive. While we will not update our specific guidance until after we close the transaction, at this point we would expect its revenue contribution to be approximately $20-25 million in 2014, and increase substantially in 2015 as we work through the deferred revenue haircut. Our aspiration is to grow revenue in this space to more than $100 million over the next two years. Now due primarily to the impact of purchase accounting and the associated deferred revenue haircut, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.10 dilutive on a non-GAAP basis in FY14, reach breakeven in the second half of 2015, and be accretive in 2016. Now without the impact of the deferred revenue haircut, we would expect that the acquisition would be accretive in 2014 and beyond.", "So now let\u2019s address our second quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. None of this guidance includes the impact of the agreement we announced today to purchase Coverity. After the acquisition closes, which we expect to occur in our second quarter, we intend to provide updated guidance. So for the second quarter of FY14, our targets are; revenue between 505 million and 515 million. Recall that there is increased variability in quarterly revenue, driven by factors such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue, timing of IP consulting projects and royalties, and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due. We continue to expect a revenue model that\u2019s approximately 90 % time-based. Total GAAP costs and expenses between 422 million and 444 million, which includes approximately 19 million of stock-based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between 377 million and 387 million; other income and expense between 0 million and $1 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.33 per share to $0.41 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 per share to $0.62 per share.", "Now our fiscal 2014 outlook, again, excluding the impact of Coverity; revenue of 2.03 billion to 2.065 billion, which reflects the timing and profile of IP revenue that Aart mentioned. Other income and expense between 8 million and 11 million; non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.83, which includes the impact of approximately $77 million in stock-based compensation expenses. We are reiterating non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60; capital expenditures of approximately $130 million; and we continue to target cash flow from operations of 425 million to 450 million. And finally, to assist in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be a bit higher than our first half revenue, with Q4 higher than both Q2 and Q3, which are similar. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly towards the second half of the year. So in summary, we\u2019ve achieved another quarter of solid financial performance and execution.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. First, we\u2019ll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen and congratulations on the transaction.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you, Rich.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "So first just wanted to clarify in terms of the expectations for Coverity ex \u2013 any deferred I mean so you had 75 million baseline sounds like in \u201813. So ex-deferred revenue effect you would have expected that revenue to be about 20% higher in \u201814 is that an accurate statement?", "Brian Beattie", "No we\u2019re not giving what\u2019s the estimate, we\u2019re just saying based on not having a deferred revenue haircut and looking back at what 2013 looked like, it would be accretive if we didn\u2019t have to do a pretty significant typical deferred revenue haircut. The key there Rich is there is about 75 million of deferred revenue that we will anticipate acquiring when the deal is approved, and again just very typical deferred revenue haircut. We think it\u2019d be close to about 80% of that would be lost in the accounting treatment. So we just want to highlight that if we didn\u2019t do that, we would be actually in breakeven immediately for \u201814.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "You mentioned it was a recurring revenue model is it a SaaS like model or is it more of the typical subscription that you currently do with your customers?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s more like typical subscription license model.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "Gotcha.", "Brian Beattie", "And very similar to ours as well.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "Gotcha. And just trying to think about how you\u2019re thinking about this from a sort of synergy perspective, Aart. I mean as you mentioned a lot of overlap in customers from the high level corporate standpoint, but clearly very different groups. And I would think you\u2019d kind of need different people calling on them so I\u2019m just wondering do you envision sales synergies here or do you really view this as kind of \u2013 is it somewhat separate operation that let you get more wallet share within some of your big customers as well as other customers outside your traditional domain?", "Aart de Geus", "That\u2019s an excellent question because we are very much looking at this. I think the first thing we have to do is really learn well how they did it. Obviously, we have experience dealing with these large customers. We have a lot of experience doing very large transactions, but we also know that sometimes it\u2019s very good to be able to sell different budgets to different people under different premise. And so, we will be quite careful before we integrate too forcefully, because Coverity clearly did a number of things very well as they grew their initial market presence. But there is benefit of being able to go to these large companies and already have a strong brand. They may be the second comment and why I\u2019m personally so ecstatic about this is that on one hand, it\u2019s absolutely adjacent. And I can say that many ways because you have seen us invest a lot in number of years in tools that all are heading towards this hardware software interaction. And of course, we know very well that our customers up to market are embedding more and more software on chips themselves are multi-prophesying, little miracles of silicon. And so right there, there is a degree of complexity that is entering the software world that used to be very well known in hardware for many years but now is really starting to play there. At the same time, beyond this adjacency, software of course is a broad term and in many of the end applications financial systems to take just one example, you can see that the complexity and the security is becoming a very real issue. And so being able to apply A, the newer techniques that Coverity has pioneered, but B potentially over time to bring some of the techniques that EDA has pioneered, I think it\u2019s just very promising, but it\u2019s going to be rolled over for discovery. So want to be careful to not overemphasize the future, but I think again in the short term this is just a fabulous extension for Synopsys.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just wanted to follow up on your trimming up your revenue guidance for \u2013 I guess it sounds like pushed out IP revenue. First want to clarify that the revenue from your non-IP businesses unchanged that\u2019s what I would sort of infer from your comments. And then just hoping you could give me some color on, why your customers are pushing out these projects and kind of how this sort of changed relative to your original expectations?", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah so, on the core tools the picture has not changed where it\u2019s always very difficult to exactly predict what one will do four quarters from now. In general, I don\u2019t think that we would say anything fundamental has changed. On the IP and actually some of the other products that tend to be much more turn oriented, meaning you do a transaction and you will turn that some of that transaction to revenue within 12 months. About a quarter of the Synopsys business falls into that category, which is by definition always make a little bit more noise on how to predict that transition. In that context, the IP deals have become more complex and are relying on a broader set of products, some of which gets delivered when the customer wants them. And the very fact that they predict that they will want something this year or next year is a function of where they are going, and some of it is predicated on when the development is finished. And the positive in that is that a number of customers are really relying quite heavily for us on all the FinFET technologies and those have their own timeline. And so as we did our own modeling which we do on a continual basis, looking forward with all these it became clear that tuning the revenue a little bit was the right thing to do. At the same time, we have said many times we focus on the earnings per share and so we manage that company for that commitment.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC", "That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, Aart.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll go to line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yeah hi. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I just wanted to clarify one thing did you say that the goal for Coverity is to go to over 200 million or was it 100 million in two years?", "Brian Beattie", "It was 100 million over the next two years, Krish.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. All right. And then one other question I want to find out was, it seemed like if you used your onshore cash to push this transaction, you\u2019ll be left with like almost no onshore cash. So this assumes that buybacks are going to cease at this point or?", "Brian Beattie", "No, let me help you clarify. First of all, we\u2019re looking at funding this with our onshore U.S. cash as well as debt and the exact balance of that is something we\u2019re working through as the deal closes. And we\u2019ll let you know what that ultimate breakdown is in the next within the next quarter as we close this transaction. And so again that is access in using our line of credit which we\u2019ve had in place for over a year. And that is totally available for these types of transactions. And then on the question of buyback, it really comes up to the same position we\u2019ve had. We said from the use of cash that M&A is our number one priority and that stays consistent and that\u2019s in line with its announcement that we made today. Secondly, as far as buybacks that\u2019s another option we\u2019ll continue to evaluate, continue to look at the best use of our cash relative to M&A relative to other buybacks, relative to paying off a little bit of our debt and we balance all those things altogether. So, that\u2019s where we balance and I\u2019ll give you the details over the next quarter of how much this will be using U.S cash and how we\u2019ll be using our line of credit to help fund it.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then final question from my end on your emulation business, the EVE business what kind of goals do you have for this year? Do you expect revenues from the business to increase, double any kind of color on that will be helpful?", "Aart de Geus", "Well we never disclose individual products, but clearly we see this as an opportunity to grow our business and our company overall. Most importantly, we also see it as a key ingredient in our verification strategy and a lot of the technical effort right now is focused on the integration of that product line with all the other technologies that we have. Stay tuned there will be more information coming out about that specifically in not too distant future, and it\u2019s clearly a field that continues to evolve very rapidly.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks, Aart. Thanks Brian.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll go the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah good afternoon. First a question when you talked about how you\u2019re trimming the revenues a little bit raising the margin, what are the dynamics behind the margin going up higher than you initially had them?", "Aart de Geus", "Well that\u2019s called management. The fact that we, to the best of our ability set a plan for the year and then during the year, we continually readjust that. And of course at any point in time, there are many variables that go in sometimes only you can have fluctuations in currency exchange for example, and we\u2019ve seen a plenty of that in the last few years. You can see that some product lines move faster than others, in other words, there is variability. The reason we have always communicated to you the first variable to be the earnings per share, specifically the non-GAAP earnings per share, is that it\u2019s sort of our way to say, hey we will do our best to rebalance if any of these variables for whatever reason, changes. And so in this case, we make sure that we\u2019re focusing on driving the ops margin by controlling the expenses or looking at the growth of our population for example, we are growing company, so there is many things we can do there. But it is a proactive act of management and it is good to see that as a team we can align behind that but very quickly as it is indicated.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. So simply if you have a lower IP level IP\u2019s lower margin that helps your margin overall?", "Aart de Geus", "No, no I wouldn\u2019t go at it from that angle. At any point in time, any of our businesses we always like to do more business. So don\u2019t worry about your variable levels of profitability of any of our products. In general, as long as product is positive it\u2019s a good thing for the company. Now having said that, when we look at variances or rebalancing of the products ever slightly so, we still look at the aggregate expenses for the company. And if not at all with that thing from time to time to focus on that because one can always find things in the drawer that\u2019s one hasn\u2019t thought spending money on. And that is exactly what we have been doing and that\u2019s why we were able to do this point in time guide for the same earnings per share guidance that we had in the beginning of the year.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. All right. And then looking at Coverity, and maybe I missed this earlier, but on a longer term basis do you see Coverity as still standalone product separate from EDA or do you integrate that technology into your EDA tools?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes and yes, I guess it\u2019s probably the best answer, because at this point in time there is no question that with some of our existing customers, there is technology that will be of interest coming in from Coverity. At the same time, my hope is that many of the deep algorithms that we have pioneered in the hardware world for many, many years will also be of high value to Coverity\u2019s products then applied to a much broader set of potential customers. And so the reason we are cautious on stating too strongly how we want to integrate is because we are facing very interesting new market for us, growth market that we want to learn as much as possible from the Coverity team. And then of course, hopefully bring some of the experiences at Synopsys had over the years to benefits of accelerating the penetration in that market.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then may be one more question on IP, when you look at it from a broad based, are you starting to see more overlap with companies like Cadence or other IP vendors or is there still really the internal production that you\u2019re trying to displace?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s in the internal that is the biggest opportunity space for us. This is a growing market and as I think I mentioned in the preamble that we see the growth rate on multi-year basis really not having changed for us. There is lots of opportunities with customers that have probably barely outsourced 50% of the building blocks that are easily outsourceable. So there are space to do things there. And the other thing is that with the increasing complexity of these blocks, I think we\u2019re going to see more customers that actually if they wanted to, can no longer do them themselves. And so, that in itself over time will provide good opportunity for us.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. But customers are cautious right now with spending, does that make it easier or harder to sell IP? If they look into decrease your cost structure or is it you just don\u2019t want to spend any money?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s an interesting question because in general, you would all would say when customers are not cautious they spend more money, but it\u2019s hard to point to the years where customers are not to some degree cautious. And IP outsourcing is particularly interesting because more often than not actually customers come at this from an economic perspective rather than technical perspective, because outsourcing IP 10 years ago was absolutely taboo. Today, it\u2019s actually a great way to accelerate the product development with state-of-the art blocks, that otherwise would be difficult to do for them and not necessarily be differentiated. In other words, they would have to spend their most competent engineering time on it, without necessarily getting differentiation. So, we\u2019ve seen in various downturns that each one of those brings about a rethinking on the side of the customer, as to what they should do and what they should not do. And the very fact that we have a very strong I think track record of quality and also support of the customer it served us well, when people want to explore outsourcing and it comes as [inaudible].", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then last question for Brian, the tax rate at 24%, do you still view that as your long term tax rate or does that change in the years to come?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah it is. We\u2019re still on the 24% range I just remind everybody as all of the CFOs look at projecting tax rates for 2014 and beyond, we have not factored in the R&D tax credit into any of our assumptions.", "Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Tom.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys. It\u2019s Zachid[ph] here for Sterling. Aart, you touched on this on a prior question, but just wanted to dig a bit deeper. In your prepared remarks, you talked about how customers remain relatively cautious, despite a lot of technological advancement. What do you think is kind of driving that disconnect? It seems like it\u2019s been a few quarters or more than few quarters, but what are some of your updated thoughts there?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think you have to start with the big picture which is of course in the last four, five years global GDP has languished. Semiconductors has done significantly better than that, but semiconductors are not growing enormously fast. However, the technology demands are growing enormously fast. And so, in many ways, customers are for starters, between this squeeze off, how do I get the money and how do I pay for all the new good stuff? Secondly, there are some markets where there has just been increase in concentration, all the way to some markets that tend to be sort of winner takes all, in terms of behavior. And so there, another dynamic is at play which is how do customers do create critical math. And that often results in either acquisitions within a product line or outright company mergers for math and for size and so all of these changes are relatively difficult to execute well. And so that is why if you look at some of the what\u2019s called, the confidence in indexes that look at semiconductors exact [inaudible] month are you it\u2019s quite remarkable how these things isolate between 48% to 52% and 50% of the intermediate between happy or unhappy. So, that life in the semiconductor lane right now and so it\u2019s not a surprise that customers are cautious, may be cautious is not even the right word, they are just managing within the budgets that they have. Now having said that, I think we have Synopsys only executed in terms of growth over quite a number of these years and we expect to continue to do that. But we have hard work and that\u2019s our job.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then on the IP push out of IP revenue, is it fair to say that most of that is customer driven meaning that they are pushing out their own product introductions which in turn, trickles down to you?", "Aart de Geus", "Somewhat, I think certainly there is number of cases where what you said is absolutely correct. There are number of cases where they do larger VPAs where either the take up of the IP or the availability on part of the IP is impacted by both their timeline and our timeline. And so those are sometimes very difficult to predict, they are good signs because they are signs of customers trusting us with their future. But sometimes it\u2019s just a little bit more difficult to predict. And as you surely can see from my earlier comments around the stress levels of technology, for our customers they moved to FinFET is a pretty big decision. We see the large guys have all gone to it after investing. This is the next segment of customers that\u2019s just now sort of moving into that domain.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then on Coverity, it sounds like they are selling to a bunch of different verticals, but can you disclose about how much they generate from the semi-vertical even if just a range?", "Aart de Geus", "Let me not do that, partially because until this is closed, I should not really speak about that company beyond what is reasonably public knowledge. What I can say certainly is that more than half of their customers today, are in the semiconductor segment that we know well. And that\u2019s of course where we initially encountered them, but it is quite interesting that at least quarter to a third, are pretty far away from where Synopsys resides. But you can immediately see how important quality is in software is just taking out the financial services or banking services, but we\u2019re also taking about people doing oil research or aeronautics research. There is a lot of software being developed. And I think the interesting insight here I hope that plays out going forward, for a number of decades the level of quality for hardware have to be extremely high, because an error can force people to redo their chip. And right there is often a multi-million dollar decision. Whereas an error in software could also be fixed by a patch, well that is true if your software is not too complicated. When the software becomes very intertwined with many other things, so we have truly systemic complexity, which we know well on the hardware side, and that is why my hope is that over time, a number of the techniques that Synopsys has pioneered will also apply to the broader software world.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re more welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, a couple of questions to start on Coverity, could you talk a bit about how the dynamics of that business differ from what you\u2019re used to in the EDA? For instance, with over 1,000 customers they would seem to have an average amount of spent per customer or may be $0.75 million or so considerably below what you\u2019re used to in EDA. Assuming that number isn\u2019t scalable for customer, would it be fair to say that much of the growth would be dependent on new customer acquisitions vis-\u00e0-vis Coverity? Also if you think about Coverity in a larger context of systems design, not just on the software quality level but more broadly does it then become also important for Synopsys to have a strong position on custom IC? I have a couple of follow ups.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. So for starters, it\u2019s interesting that the numbers that you cited, when we started Synopsys, we would have loved to have numbers like that. And it took quite a while to build up the transactions and relationships that we have with our customers today, it took many years and of course, the sales approaches quite a bit what for us has been like 25, 27 years or so. Having said that though, I think you\u2019re still pointing your finger at an interesting set of questions which is there will be a number of questions that initially are brand new customers that are new to using tools around software. And there one will gradually penetrate that market, there are some customers that very quickly will realize if the software works well and its impact how can they move to larger volumes, how can they broaden the utilization or how can they even do what we at Synopsys did, which ultimately mandates the software utilization? Now I don\u2019t think that there is much correlation between this and what we do in the custom world, except for the one area that I think is interesting in long term which is the intersection between digital and custom is clearly visible in the Internet of things. The Internet of things is full of things that have software embedded and so when you look at that in aggregate, this is precisely what I always refer to as systemic complexity very multi-dimensional set of things. I think right now this is all looking far forward. The way we should look at Coverity it is new time that is existing today on the very focused area of quality and testing and security of software. And just focusing on that alone will be our first challenge. The reason I said some of these other things is just because I see a natural adjacency for both our technology and market position.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Couple more for you Aart, regarding the bigger picture of the market. You mentioned that you are seeing some improved penetration or consolidation on some accounts, with your largest customer you clearly have the large majority of the customer spent. The question is are you seeing a trend where you are now have become the majority of a greater number of customer spend? Is that a trend at all? Go on, sorry.", "Aart de Geus", "In general, our objective obviously is to grow with our customer and to grow into customers where we are not well represented. Ultimately the EDA industry is relatively stable, but within that Synopsys has done I think well. For those customers that are really impacted by our tools and it tends to come from the advanced site of the spectrum, all people knew very large volumes very high complexity, low power designs, that\u2019s our natural home. And so, the fact that our tools are increasingly performance and \u2013 increasingly performing very well together I think is one of the reasons that a number of customers have broaden their footprint with us. But you have to earn that every day and it\u2019s a field of continued change so we\u2019ll keep pushing on that and opportunity for us.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Lastly, geographic question for you and in terms of the whole industry, Asia-Pac has been by far the fastest growing market over the last a number of years and in fact decade. Not just on the too side, but increasingly on the IP side if you do a 10 year CAGR analysis, it looks like Asia-Pac for you, has been a mid-teens growth business and all other regions, low to mid-single digits. The question is do you see any risk that could potentially decelerate or disrupt the kind of above average growth that you\u2019ve seen in Asia-Pac for these last many years? And conversely, are you seeing any sense of it bottoming in Japan outside the currency effects, are you seeing any signs that the long slow erosion in that market as far as EDA is concerned is beginning to bottom out?", "Aart de Geus", "Well let me start with the top of the question. Of course, the growth of one region comes out at the expense of another within the profile of the overall growth of the semiconductor industry. And so, if you grow higher than the industry then some other region must better finish and grow lower. And you\u2019re absolutely correct that Asia-Pacific initially coming from almost nowhere, has grown to become a very, very market. It is also a market that has invested in technology and invested in this cooling of technologist i.e. engineers substantially. So that reason alone makes it an interesting place. If you have add to the fact that some of those economies specifically China has the potential to grow its own image as a customer base substantially, surely one would believe that, that can continue for a while. If you look at Japan, I do think that they are a number of positive while very difficult changes and you can see it in companies that are restructuring, that are refocusing and of course at the national level, there has been a high degree of emphasis on stimulating the economy and utilize currency as one of the mechanisms to do so. I think the feedback tends to be a little up and down from one quarter to another you only have to read the newspapers to see that. But I am still a believer that in aggregate, the structural changes that industry is going through are necessary. They are being fooled, they will take some time, but over time, Japan hi-tech if I put it on the umbrella will emerge stronger.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Sorry can I squeeze one in for Brian, on the IP business. In Q1, would it be fair to say that there was a close correlation between the $10 million or so drop in IT revenue in Q4 and the $10 million drop or so in your services revenue in Q4?", "Brian Beattie", "I\u2019d say that as far as one of the changes for our IP business as we saw in Q1, that the services part is down and that just again reflects the timing of the bookings of when those transactions came in the breath of the larger contracts and in fact coming through as well. So, you\u2019re right, it is IP, it is related to services line which is different. And again, remember this is contract by contract, account by account and it varies by quarter to quarter. We had anticipated some reductions in terms of IP business going from Q4 to Q1 as we let everybody know at last year. And then as we look ahead to our guidance for Q2, again it looks like a stronger business based on the projections that we have at this point for Q2.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And no one else is queuing up with the question.", "Aart de Geus", "So at this point in time, let me thank you again for joining us for this call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)  Today\u2019s call will last one hour.  Five minutes prior to the end of the call I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference.  As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "", "Lisa Ewbank", "Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.  During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.  While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our 10-K for fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, and in our earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 issued earlier today.  In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information, can be found in our first quarter earnings release and financial supplement.  All of these items are currently available on our website at synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon.  I am pleased to report that our first quarter of fiscal 2009 was capped by solid financial performance, continued technology momentum, and visible customer success.  Let me begin with our financial results.  In Q1, we delivered revenue of $339.8 million, 8% growth year over year.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50, well above our target range.  We achieved these results under a predictable business model with more than 90% time-based revenue.  With the recession in mind, we continue to focus on expense controls and operating efficiency, and we expect our earnings to be solidly on track for the year.  Finally, we excited the quarter with $842 million of cash and no debt.  ", "Turning to the overall landscape, we see that in the deepening recession, our customers are de-risking every aspect of their business, and our strong position clearly sets us apart from other suppliers.  In other words, because of our financial stability, we can and do continue to invest in technology development and provide vital support.  This customer scrutiny of vendor stability is unlikely to change anytime soon.  I just spent a number of weeks traveling to customers in the US and Europe and attending world economic forums.  As I tally the perspectives of the nearly 100 executives I talked to, most believe that the recession will be deep and are preparing for it to last well into 2010.  It\u2019s fair to say that all customers are battening down their hatches and focusing on reducing risk and even more importantly reducing costs.", "At the same time, many of our customers are also keeping an eye on the future.  These companies are explicitly using this difficult time to streamline their processes and better focus on the most important customer, technology, and current projects.  Fortunately for the EDA industry, semiconductor expense cuts have been mostly on the manufacturing side.  Our gross margin is sensitive to chip volume.  On the R&D side, design is clearly continuing, albeit with some caution.  Many customers are reassessing their design flows with the goal of coming out of the recession streamlined, more efficient, and recovery ready with compelling new products to sell into an improving economy.  ", "This trend plays well for Synopsys\u2019 strength, and we fully intend to emerge as an even more viable partner for our customers.  Not only are we their safest bets based on our financial stability and the completeness of our product portfolio so that we can actually help them attack their total cost of design, and with our advanced methodologies and tools help ensure that they remain technically robust.  The proof of this trend is evident in our steadily growing number of primary partner relationships.  Today for example, we announced that LSI has joined a number of other key companies in selecting Synopsys as its primary EDA partner.  Across our portfolio ranging from digital design to digital and analog verification to IP and low power solutions, LSI is betting on Synopsys to jointly drive design cost efficiency and technology leverage.  ", "Meanwhile, we\u2019re actively working with several other important companies on transitions to similar partnerships.  While we intend to weather the storm and expect to come out of the recession in an even stronger position, we are very mindful of the economic uncertainty and of the challenges our customers are facing.  Since January, we have seen a couple of companies filing for bankruptcy protection and an increase in late payments.  Bookings were lighter than expected, and we anticipate that some customers hesitant to make commitments with little visibility in their business will renew contracts closer to their expiration.  ", "Our business model is well suited for times like these.  Timing of orders is less important enabling us to focus on what is best in the long term for our customers and ourselves.  The economic outlook is uncertain though, and we are aiming to deliver continued solid earnings.  We\u2019ve already taken a number of expense mitigation steps contributing to solid Q1 EPS.  Having said that, our top priority is to avoid any disruption to our customers in either technology or support.  So we continue to systematically reduce expenses in non-differentiating areas and invest those resources to drive long term customer success and commitment.  With this approach, we feel confident we\u2019ll be prepared if the market continues to soften.  If the market starts to improve, all the better.", "Now, let me turn to our technology which has been a critical factor as customers select their key partners.  We have a comprehensive portfolio built over many years from the system level through design and verification of both digital and analog mixed signal chips and down to manufacturing.  Our leading IP portfolios span the key connectivity protocols today, and our global engineering force is unmatched in terms of talent, scale, and expertise.", "We continue to invest strongly in R&D and are delivering technology enhancements across our core portfolio, focused primarily on performance and cost effectiveness.  In physical design, IC Compiler features a new router that delivers 10X faster performance and better quality of results.  Based on a large amount of customer feedback, we feel that our physical solution is stronger than it has ever been, and we\u2019re seeing significant competitive wins.  In December, we delivered the much faster multicore version of PrimeTime.  In addition, we are collaborating with companies such as ST Microelectronics to develop leading edge methodologies and flows for low power and high performance cells.  We now have multi-core capability throughout the digital design platform, a key differentiator for Synopsys.", "In verification, we delivered major performance and ease of use advances in VCS that have already driven competitive win with both advanced and more mainstream customers.  In manufacturing, our TCAD is increasingly used by customers developing process technology, especially advanced modes.  TCAD simulation is able to reduce a good amount of expensive hardware based experimentations and thus helps to get better technology at lower costs.  ", "Looking forward, we see a strong technical pipeline as well.  In March, at our San Jose user group conference, we will be introducing many new capabilities.  First a single solution for custom simulation that combines accuracy and speech features into one flexible easy to deploy solution.  Second, an extension of our multi-core capability to VCS functional verification, and finally we will introduce a brand new top-down approach to helping customers reduce their total cost of design.  That is streamline their design projects, optimize EDA investments, and manage projects to get faster and more predictable results.  This new design system is architected for easy of adoption providing both mainstream and advanced users a more efficient, low-risk foundry ready path from design to silicon.  Stay tuned for more details.", "I\u2019d like to now highlight two of our strategic investments\u2014custom designs and system level solutions.  In just the first few months of limited customer availability, our new analog mix signal design solution custom designer has generated a substantial amount of customer interest and new orders again in Q1.  While small companies with legacy cost structure were the natural initial target customers, we\u2019re increasingly seeing interest from larger customers wanting to evaluate our solution.  General availability is currently on track for the spring.  ", "At the system level, we are addressing the accelerating demand for more effective yet powerful hardware based verification solutions.  Last week, we introduced an expanded rapid prototyping platform, Confirma.  It already includes the recently acquired CHIPit technology which significantly improves the economics of both embedded software development and system validation.  Synopsys now delivers a comprehensive software to silicon verification solution, from system modeling to rapid prototyping in virtual platforms to functional verification and analog mix signal simulation.  ", "To conclude, while the economic weather became more turbulent, Synopsys began the year with solid Q1 results.  In addition, a number of customers have increased their reliance on Synopsys as they ride out the tempest.  While transitions are never simple, we are helping them reduce their total cost of design while capturing the benefits of a more streamlined design methodology.  As the saying goes, never let a crisis go unused.  Together with our customers, we\u2019re doing exactly that. ", "In summary, our strategy for \u201909 is to weather the recession and emerge even stronger by being fiscally conservative, competitively aggressive and strategically focused.  ", "With that now I will turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "", "Brian Beattie", "Good afternoon everyone.  In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance.  As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website.  In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year over year unless I specify otherwise. ", "We executed well in the first quarter to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth, strong operating margins, and our balance sheet remains very healthy.  Total revenue increased 8% to $3339.8 million, at the high end of our target range, with greater than 90% of Q1 revenue coming from beginning of quarter backlog.  One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue.  ", "Turning to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $272 million, which included $11.8 million of amortization of intangible assets and $14.1 million of share-based compensation.  Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $250 million, an expected year over year increase due mainly to our Synplicity acquisition but also slightly below our target range due to companywide cost control and timing of quarterly expenses.  For the balance of the year, we expect typical quarterly expense profile with a sequential increase in total expenses in both Q2 and Q3 and a traditionally higher Q4.  For all of 2009, we continue to expect total costs and expenses to increase generally in line with or slightly less than our targeted revenue growth.  ", "Non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 26% during the quarter, a very good start towards achieving our goal of 23% for the full year.  We intend to aggressively manage expenses to reach our margin targets and prepare for an uncertain outlook in 2010 while at the same time aligning resources to where Synopsys will add value to our customers.  ", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.37.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50, exceeding our target range.  Earnings outperformance was driven by solid topline growth and expense control, higher than expected other income, a slightly lower than expected tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26% for the quarter.  For modeling purposes, we think that a 27% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for the full year.", "Our revenue visibility remained strong.  Upfront revenue was 5% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%, even with the inclusion of hardware sales.  The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.7 years.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items, our balance sheet remains very healthy with $842 million in cash and short-terms investments and no debt.  Of this balance, 53% is held within the US.  As expected, there was an operating cash outflow of $82 million in the quarter due primarily to the timing of our annual incentive compensation payments.  For all of 2009, we\u2019re closely monitoring cash collections as we\u2019ve seen a recent increase in late payments from some of our customers; however, at this time, we\u2019re maintaining our FY09 operating cash flow target of approximately $200 to $220 million.", "Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $8 million in the quarter, and for the full year, we expect to reduce capital spending by 15% to approximately $30 to $35 million.  We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $210 million remaining on our current authorization. Also recall that we acquired CHIPit assets of Prodesign during the quarter in an all cash deal funded from a combination of our international and US cash balances.  As always, we will evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter including company operations, investments, and stock repurchases.", "Our strong cash balance has served us well in the current environment, and in the near term, we value the flexibility that our cash provides.  We\u2019re also pleased with the high quality and conservative risk profile of our cash investment portfolio. ", "Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $150 million, and we maintained industry-leading DSOs of 40 days.  Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $609 million.  We ended Q1 with approximately 5700 employees.  This was an expected year-over-year increase due primarily to our acquisition of Synplicity, but also slightly down from our Q4 headcount.  For all of 2009, we currently expect headcount to be about flat with year end 2008.", "Now moving on to guidance, for the second quarter of FY '09, our targets are revenue between $332 and $340 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $280.5 and $296 million, which includes approximately $15 million of share-based compensation expense, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $257 and $267 million, other income and expense between zero and $3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between 142 million and 147 million, GAAP earnings of $0.25 to $0.30 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.39 to $0.41 per share.  We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2009 outlook:  Based on what we know now, we expect revenue of approximately $1.37 to $1.40 billion, other income and expense between $6 and $10 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between 144 million and 149 million, GAAP earnings per share between $1.11 and $1.27, which includes the impact of approximately $60 million in share-based compensation expense. Given the uncertain environment, we\u2019re maintaining our non-GAAP earnings per share, of $1.60 to $1.72; however, after delivering solid Q1 earnings, we have more confidence in this range and expect a penny or two of our Q1 over-achievement to benefit full year earnings driven primarily by higher than expected other income.  As I mentioned earlier, we are still targeting cash flow from operations of $200 to $220 million.", "In conclusion, I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter execution given the many challenges in the global marketplace.  We delivered solid financial results highlighted by top and bottomline growth and continued solid operating margins.  We exited Q1 in a strong financial position providing us the flexibility to best position our business for long term growth during this difficult period.  ", "With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera with Needham and Company. ", "", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham and Company", "Aart, just wanted to ask a question on the bookings front.  You mentioned that booking were a little lighter than expected in the quarter.  I know last quarter you had mentioned you were still seeing some increasing run rates on your renewals.  I just wanted to get your sense of what was it that caused the light bookings in the quarter.  Was it lower run rate renewals or was it just some companies deferring their actual orders into future periods?", "Aart de Geus", "Rich, it was clearly the second.  The run rates are flattish.  The reason people tend to renew sluggishly, if that\u2019s the word, is that they\u2019re clearly not having much visibility themselves, and so what I expect will continue to happen over the next many quarters is that people are just gradually going to drift more towards the end of the contracts because at this point in time making no decision is often easier than making any decision. ", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham and Company", "With respect to the duration, which was the lowest seen in quite a while, do you think there\u2019s anything to that?  Do you think customers are less willing to make long-term commitments now, or is this just noise in the statistics?", "Aart de Geus", "I think it\u2019s mostly noise, although I think you\u2019re still aiming at a very interesting question because I think that we\u2019re going to see more binary behavior, meaning that we clearly see some customers that want to do business with us and that are banking on us wanting to actually at times do longer deals whereas people that are not sure will just try to minimize any decision they have to make, and so I think the sample set was not all that relevant in this case, but nonetheless, I think it\u2019s not indicative of a major trend yet.  ", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham and Company", "Last quarter, you gave us a qualitative bookings guidance that you expected book to bill to be slightly less than 1 to 1 for the year.  Would you care to update that?  Presumably maybe you would expect it to be slightly weaker than that.  I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be willing to add any color to that previous guidance.", "Aart de Geus", "Largely, I don\u2019t want to do that partially because I don\u2019t think I have necessarily the color.  I think there are an enormous number of moving pieces right now in the economy, and so it is possible that a number of people suddenly decide to want to do longer deals with us, and it is also possible that we see a number of people just waiting for their contracts to end, and thus be back more next year or the year after, and so frankly I don\u2019t have the answer.  I think we\u2019re in a good situation that from a business point of view we\u2019re well placed, and from a business model point of view, we\u2019re of course in an outstanding position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Brian, a question for you.  In the $2.6 billion of backlog that you exited last year, I notice in your supplement what looks like a new note highlighting the fact that there may be some risk to the backlog, and I\u2019m wondering if you could expand a little bit on whether you think you have exposure in the backlog and what it is that would move in these what I thought were contractual commitments with customers.", "Brian Beattie", "The contracts that we have as bookings are all firm commitments, legally binding, no escape clauses, so they\u2019re really locked down.  What we saw in the quarter was a couple of our customers filing for protection under Chapter 11 under the bankruptcy court, so in that case, to the extent there is some of their business still in the backlog, then we will de-book that as a conservative approach to take our any forecasted revenues and any forecasted bookings that will come in there.  Up to this point though, it\u2019s a very immaterial number for our total backlog, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor it, continue to look at cash payments, collections, and credit status of the customers, but as you know, the majority of our customers are very large semiconductor companies who are financially pretty stable, albeit with some uncertain times in front of them.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Aart, abstracting away from some of the detail in the quarter, etc., the semi industry and certainly the capital equipment side the worst downturn ever.  I\u2019ve heard people Mike Splinter suggest that we\u2019re going to see profound structural changes in this industry.  There\u2019s obviously a push to consolidation, etc.  How do you think, and maybe it\u2019s too early, but what do you think happens to the industry and what are the implications of likely consolidation and some of what\u2019s going on in EDA and specifically Synopsys in your view?", "Aart de Geus", "First, I agree with Mike\u2019s perspective that the entire semiconductor industry is going to shift towards a more efficient model one way or another, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique at all to the semiconductor industry.  It\u2019s clearly part of a massive recession that initially had nothing to do with semiconductor industry, so having said that, the first call there is that many of the products that are on the market today may have a hiatus or may be working down on their inventory, but over time, it\u2019s an industry that will come back and will continue to deliver and develop many new products.  Having said that though, I think that the entire industry looking for efficiency will also look at how to do better design, and fortunately, we\u2019re in a very good position because we started to focus on total cost of design already a few years ago, and you certainly have heard me say many times that includes much more integrated design flows, it includes better utilization of the most advanced tools and technologies, and gradually a more consolidated spending picture.  In that context, next month in March, we\u2019ll be rolling out specifically a tool set around making the design flow much more manageable, so we\u2019re very much aimed at how do we help not only the technology future but also the cost equation of our customers.  So notwithstanding that, there are huge economic waves around us.  I think our ship happens to be particularly robust at this point in time.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "How do you think about M&A in this environment?  You clearly indicated that you\u2019re going to be very careful with cash, that cash is king.  I think that\u2019s good.  There are a lot of really wounded companies in this ecosystem here that you can almost buy for free.  Is this something that you still consider or you\u2019re not really looking at M&A at this point or is indeed a mechanism that you can use to get even further ahead in the short term?", "Aart de Geus", "We\u2019re always keeping our mind open and looking at everything.  At the same time, in M&A right now, the A in many cases stands for attrition, meaning that there are a lot changes occurring with companies that I don\u2019t think will survive period, and of course one may be tempted to look at spending money on those, but upon closer inspection, often one finds that it will take more money than it brings in in the future.  Having said that, I think that it is very difficult to predict the whole makeup of the recession going forward.  We will be careful.  We\u2019re fiscally, I think, at this point very conservative, because we realize full well that in these waves one needs to be very careful with the cash.  Having said that, I think we just acquired a small asset this past quarter, CHIPit, that fits particularly well into our offering in an area that is seeing very great customer demand which is rapid prototyping, and so I think it shows you that we will be open to interesting opportunities, but we\u2019re certainly not rushing into things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Petkun with D.A. Davidson & Company.", "", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Brian, on the expense line, that was where we saw some of the upside obviously in Q1, and you did mention that there were some cost cuts.  Looking to the guidance for Q2, I know you said to expect expense growth as revenues grow, but it looks like revenues this quarter could be flattish but we\u2019re still going to see about $11 million in crease in non-GAAP expenses.  Can you help us understand where we\u2019re going to see that increase?", "Brian Beattie", "The expenses are going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, just given the levels of accruals we make, the business levels of activity that we close in a quarter, and it\u2019s going to move around a little bit, and this is pretty typical for us.  Q1 typically is a lighter quarter, and then as various teams hit various compensation levels and so on throughout the year, the expense base and commissions and so on gradually increases until basically you\u2019re into an accelerated mode in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re representing as far as the profile we expect for the rest of this year.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Any commentary, Aart, you might be willing to share in terms of the pricing environment, especially in light of your commentary about maybe some competitors facing more pressures?", "Aart de Geus", "I think there\u2019s no question that some people will fight for survival at this point in time, and will try to do that at the end of the day with pricing.  At the same time, it\u2019s also clear that quite a number of customers have now become very concerned about a variety of suppliers not just in our domain and would be weary even if things are very cheap to commit their future on companies that they\u2019re not sure are going to be around, and so that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no price pressure.  There has always been, but it\u2019s also clear that we have the opportunity to keep investing.  In fact, we have the opportunity by the way to also keep supporting on a global basis many of our customers, and that has not gone unnoticed.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Aart, on the last call you will talk about the opportunity with maybe a specific deal on a specific consolidation scenario where you guys might have an opportunity to improve your standing.  Have you see that business come in this quarter, and is there any way you could elaborate on that?", "Aart de Geus", "Actually one of them was, I believe, announced today which is with LSI where we had worked closely with them over a period of time to see how we could help them optimize their overall design flow and solution, and they clearly picked us as their primary partner for the future, and so there are quite a number of these types of situations that we\u2019re working on.  As you can imaging, every company is different by virtue of their history, their type of designs, etc., but the common denominator in all of those things is the same, which is how do you I stay a the leading edge from a technology point of view and how do I simultaneously rein in the cost, and that is the dialogue that is the dialogue that we absolutely seek with our customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of K.C. Rajkumar with RBC Capital Markets", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "You guys mentioned that you expect people to drift closer to the contract renewal date as the year drags on.  Can you just comment on how many or what fraction of customers you expect that to happen to and if that places any pressure on the target bookings which you have fiscal \u201909?", "Aart de Geus", "", "From a sales force point of view, there\u2019s always pressure on booking because that is their main role in the company.  At the time, precisely because we have a business model that has been crafted over many years, we can plan ahead and sort of see what is going to happen in the economy and prepare the company.  If the downturn worsens, then we can plan ahead from an expense point of view.  If it starts to look up, we can take positive strides from there.  Be it as it may, I think we\u2019re in a relatively solid position, and not likely to be sort of held hostage at the end of a quarter, if that\u2019s the right terminology.  I think if one doubles up from that picture, I think we fundamentally have to realize that this is very deep and long recession, and therefore for us the most important thing is really how do we help our customers do well during this time, how do we help them focus on their total cost of design, and at the same time make sure that the business we do is healthy for the long term, and I think if we follow those premises, Synopsys will fare just fine.", "", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Is it fair to assume that as and when your customers renew closer to their contract expiry, some of those contracts would simply slip into next fiscal year and probably therefore that has now placed your fiscal \u201909 guidance into any jeopardy?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, these are bookings contracts, and typically if you take a round number for all three years, while the contract is running, fundamentally we keep reporting on revenue on a completely ratable fashion, so it really doesn\u2019t matter technically if a booking is on this side or the other side of fiscal quarter or fiscal year.  Now from a sales point of view, of course, we drive our sales force to continue to work the customer interactions and close booking, but from a revenue point of view, it is all a very smooth transition, so I think as I said earlier what is very unique and very powerful about this business model is that it allows us to plan much further ahead and take preemptive action if necessary well ahead of the time that there may be challenges.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Aart, you made a comment earlier which goes \u201cnever let crises go unused.\u201d  Can you elaborate what you mean by that comment?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, and pardon if this is a little bit too popular management, but many people will say that crises are opportunities to make changes that companies have wanted to do or should have done a long time ago, but so often the daily urgency takes precedence on the long term imperative, and so as many of our customers are forced to relook at their P&L and are very much compelled to look at their cost equation, they also realize that not just the spending in EDA but how they spend in EDA is often suboptimal including a lot of internal work that could be reduced or could be improved upon, and so one of the key values we think we can bring to our customers is to explain and show them how they can substantially streamline their design flows, follow some standardization in IP use for example that allows them to cut the amount of expenses they have around these flows, and what happens in crisis situations is only high level management has a much higher degree of attention for these types of proposals than in the past and thus there is a better opportunity for us to advocate that perspective, and indeed we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re having quite a number of high level dialogue with customers to help them save money in the long term and in the process build a very strong relationship with Synopsys.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Maybe this is way too early to ask this question, but for those customers who are due to renew next year, what are you guys hearing from them?  Are they coming back to you guys and tell you that they expect that things are still on track or is it too early to ask that question.  I guess what I\u2019m getting at is what is the sense that you guys have on your customers who are due to renew next year?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Frankly it\u2019s not always not the best idea to start asking customers that renew way in the future now what they think as everybody is looking at a recession that is not fully understood, and so there is no reason to rush forward on that, and I think it\u2019s also fair to say that it is very difficult to predict what will happen.  The stimuli may have some impact in the short term, but maybe it\u2019s just sufficient to keep the economy going rather than prospering again.  Be it as it may, my own sense is that we probably do well to be very conservative and careful at this time and that an assumption of thinking that the recession could go well into 2010 is probably wise as we look at our resources, our cost base, and how to support our key customers, and so if the weather looks up before that time, all the better, but meanwhile I think we are very solidly on top of having all the mechanisms of cost control works out, and if necessary, we will have the courage to take action.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with JP Morgan", "Saket Kalia - JPMorgan", "Aart, would you be willing to disclose how many primary EDA relationships you have worldwide?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Actually we have disclosed a few explicitly over the years, and I think it\u2019s five that we have talked about.  We can get back to you specifically with those that were announced.  De facto, we have a few more that have been either de facto or have been accomplished without any communication, and then we have a slew of other relationships that are progressing in that direction.", " ", "Saket Kalia - JPMorgan", "", "For Brian, sales and marketing was down pretty significantly in the quarter over the last quarter.  Just wondering how much of that decline was related to the lighter bookings than you expected versus expense control done in the quarter.", "", "Brian Beattie", "", "When you look at the spending in sales and marketing expense, the headcount is relatively flat if now down a little bit, so the rest of it really relates to commission expense that as I mentioned earlier hits accelerators typically in the fourth quarter, and then in the first quarter, you start accruing a new base, if you like, so as we achieve that number, as I mentioned, continues to grow throughout the year, so from an ongoing expense perspective, we\u2019ve held the operating margins where we are, we are shooting at the 23% mark and did very well in the first quarter with 26%.  We\u2019re looking at keeping the expenses as tight as we can going forward, but we did give you the profile of the expense increase from Q1 to 2 and 3, and then based on achievement of the targets in the fourth quarter, that expense does go up.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.  Please continue.", "Aart de Geus", "Given that there are no more questions, as usual Brian and I will be available after the call.  We appreciate your support at this time that is to say the least very interesting.  I\u2019d like to reiterate that although we see quite a number of clouds on the horizon, Synopsys is actually in a very good place to advantage of our position, and we will continue to communicate very directly and frankly with you.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "During the course of this conference call, we may discuss forecasts, targets and make other forward-looking statements regarding Synopsys and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current estimates of our future results and performance, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter and in our fourth quarter 2006 earnings release. In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in our fourth quarter earnings release and financial supplement. Our earnings release, financial supplement and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter are all currently available on our website at Synopsys.com. ", "With us today we have Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO; and Brian Beattie, CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart.", " Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. Today\u2019s call comes at a good time for Synopsys. We not only had a strong quarter and a very successful year, but we are also eager to share our expectations for top and bottom line growth with you, and how we are moving the company to the next level. Q4 fiscal 2006 was excellent for Synopsys. We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth, solid cash flow and overall business results that were notably above plan. ", "On the product side, our technology initiatives are clearly improved with accelerating momentum in customer adoptions and strong new product rollouts. Let me briefly summarize our financial highlights. ", "Revenue for the year grew 10.4% to approximately $1.1 billion. Q4 revenues were $283 million, an 11% increase over last year. We continued to manage expenses very well. Overall non-GAAP expenses for the year grew just 2% as we offset acquisitions and compensation increases with targeted cost reductions. ", "For the quarter, we came in at $242 million, at the low end of our target range. Non-GAAP operating margin was 14.1% for the year and 14.5% for the quarter. Both were nearly double the same period last year and higher than beginning of year guidance, even after factoring in several acquisitions. ", "Non-GAAP earnings were $0.77 per share for the year and $0.21 for the quarter; again, nearly double the same period last year. During the year, backlog grew to an industry high $2 billion which provides unprecedented stability and visibility.  Looking forward, we plan to pass the 20% operating margin mark during the second half of fiscal '07. Beyond '07, in the next several years, we will drive to a mid to high 20s target as the next milestone. ", "Before I describe our strategy to achieve these objectives, let me comment on the overall environment and provide some technology highlights. ", "Looking at semiconductors, we hear some level of caution as the industry settles into a high single-digit growth rate for the year.  Longer term, the semiconductor industry appears quite stable. The growing wave of video and consumer applications will increase the demand for processing power, bandwidth and storage. Although our customers remain quite sensitive to their product cost, especially for the consumer segment, the technology race is clearly on. The move to slower geometry certainly shows no signs of slowing down. Spending on EDA appears to be improving as our industry has an impact on both product differentiation and manufacturing costs. As the leader in advanced IC technologies, Synopsys is particularly well-positioned. ", "Moving on to our technology, business for the full year was strong across every product line. In Q4, IP as well as analog digital verification were especially strong. Starting with core EDA, Galaxy, our implementation platform had another strong orders quarter and hit a number of major milestones. ", "As mentioned last quarter, our field force has completed its migration to IC Compiler support. Innovations and adoptions have accelerated and the product ramp is right on track. In Q4, we passed the $100 million mark in IC Compiler orders. The tape account is mounting rapidly with recent successes at companies like Toshiba. Many more tape-outs are in the pipeline. ", "Customers are indeed seeing promised improvements in performance and time to results. During the quarter, we displaced the competition at four companies. At several more, we gained entry into a competitor\u2019s domain. The technology in our latest Synthesis release is very strong as well. The resulting adoption of our high end Design Compiler Ultra accelerated in Q4. In fact, we displaced competitors at four companies and doubled our position at a fifth company, one that had previously experimented with another Synthesis tool. ", "Now, to Discovery, our analog and digital verification platform. Discovery did extremely well, both in Q4 and throughout the full year. The move to smaller geometries and higher complexity chips has accelerated the demand for verification tools. In fact, Q4 was our largest ever quarter for VCF, our core digital solution. The migration to System Verilog accelerated as well. The maturity of the tools and the efficiency of the language are now clearly proven. For example, Enterasys, a provider of security-enabled network infrastructure, chose Synopsys after an extensive competitive evaluation. The move to System Verilog with VCF doubled their verification productivity. With this kind of performance differentiation we are winning business from our major competitors. ", "During the quarter, Freescale, a global leader in the design and manufacture of embedded semiconductors signed an agreement to continue deployment of Discovery for System Verilog based verification. ", "In analog mixed signal verification, Q4 business was also well above plan. We continue to be the clear choice for mixed signal verification with superior performance and productivity. For example, Virage Logic adopted H5 as it's global simulator for it's 90 nanometer and below AFAT logic library. ", "Turning now to our high growth adjacencies, let's look first at manufacturing. Our strategy is to grow a powerful position in all key technologies in the design to manufacturing chain, and to link them together by bringing data from the fab up into the design process. This is especially important as customers move to 65 nanometer and below. During Q4, we shipped the first orders of Prime Yield, our first product that integrates advanced manufacturing data into design. Last month, we announced yet another linked product family called process aware DFM. Targeted at custom and analog design for 45 nanometer and below, these new solutions integrate TCAD derived manufacturing data into physical design tools. The impact is better results and fewer resends. ", "On the lithography side we announced a collaboration with Nikon to develop and deliver next generation manufacturing aware models for 45 nanometers. We're also leveraging advanced 3D lithography simulation from our recent acquisition of Sigma C. ", "Moving up to our other adjacency, system level design, we are realizing the benefits of our investments in connectivity IP more and more. With momentum in both digital and mixed signal cores, customers are committing to buying our off-the-shelf high quality IP to accelerate their time to market. In fact, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for designware cores. This success was led by our standards-based IP, especially USB , wireless USB and PCI express cores. ", "In particular, our analog mixed signal cores are doing very well. With speed requirements increasing, analog design has become much more difficult at smaller geometries. PCI express and SATA are good examples of this growing technical challenge. Our investments in this direction are now paying off. Synopsys delivers very reliable and differentiated mixed signal IP for this complex protocols. ", "Turning to systems, we completed the integration of Virtuo and are sharing a compelling road map with our customers. With our virtual platform, software engineers can develop and validate their software up to a year before the hardware is actually available. Our vision is not only to drive incremental growth in system level design, but also to streamline a complete system to design to manufacturing flow. This flow will reduce risk, power consumption and time to market and will yield higher performance for our customers. ", "Finally, let me briefly outline our overall strategy to move the company to the next level. We are now building on a very solid foundation after completing a set of major changes over the past several years:", "With all these changes completed, our focus is now squarely aimed at getting more value for what we provide. Our priorities for '07 and beyond are:", "You'll hear more about these initiatives in the next several months. The organizational changes, our technology strength and the momentum in our results have energized the entire Synopsys team. We feel that we have entered a new phase of the company and we are strongly focused on capturing value and share and expanding our business reach. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian who will provide more detail on the financials.", "Brian Beattie  ", "Thanks, Aart. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. ", "Our results in Q4 and the full fiscal year were excellent. Q4 revenue was up 11% year over year to $283.4 million. Non-GAAP operating margin nearly doubled to 14.5% and earnings per share were $0.21, all beating our internal targets. ", "For the full year, revenue was up 10.4% to approximately $1.1 billion, while at the same time, we increased backlog by $100 million to a record $2 billion with a book to bill ratio of greater than one. We also generated more than $200 million in operating cash flow.", "Now as Aart mentioned, the changes we've made over the last couple of years not only allows us to function more efficiently but also to focus on new ways to grow our business. We're already seeing the benefits. Let me provide some additional financial details.", "We continue to have excellent visibility, approximately 93% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and more than 80% of FY '07 revenue is already in hand. GAAP earnings per share were $0.07 in Q4 and $0.17 for the full year. COGS and expenses totaled $273 million in Q4 and $1.067 billion for the full year. For the year, GAAP results included $120 million of amortization of intangible assets, in process R&D and stock-based compensation. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.21 in Q4, more than double the same period last year, and we earned $0.77 for the full year. In Q4, we held non-GAAP expenses to $242 million, even factoring in an expected increase due to acquisitions and one-time items such as severance and increased variable compensation. We successfully offset much of this upward pressure with a reduction in our expense base from the headcount actions and expense management. As a result, we enter FY '07 with a lower base expense run rate than we did in '06. ", "For the year, we held our non-GAAP expenses to $941 million as we offset increases due to acquisitions, inflation, and severance by cutting expenses by offshoring and a broad cost discipline.", "Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 14.5% in Q4, an increase of 7 percentage points over last year. For the full year, it was 14.1%. The non-GAAP tax rate was 31% in Q4 and 32% for the full year. We continue to have a stable contract mix with 95% of Q4 product orders booked as time-based licenses and 5% booked as upfront. For the full year, 6% were booked as upfront, well within our target range of less than 10%. ", "One customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter and for the year. ", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments remains healthy at approximately three years. We're seeing the benefits of our ratable model in a couple of ways. First, excellent visibility and also in our customer engagements. It gives us the flexibility to continue to work with a customer on an agreement and not feel forced to close it before the end of the quarter. Q4 was a good example. We have continued negotiating several deals that started in Q4 so that we could increase the value for both parties. We did so and we're still able to exceed our target for the quarter.", "Turning now to cash. Operating cash flow was $100 million in Q4 and $206 million for the full year which was above our target. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and $48 million for the full year. Cash, short-term investments increased $61 million to $573 million. Now, that strong cash balance was achieved even with a very active stock repurchase program during the year. ", "In Q4, we purchased 1.6 million shares for $30 million. For the full year, we spent $200 million purchasing more than 10 million shares of our stock and have approximately $237 million left on our authorization. Primarily as a result of this repurchase program, Q4 diluted share count decreased 2 million shares sequentially and 5 million shares compared to Q4 of '05. As always, we will continue to evaluate the best uses of our cash each quarter including company operations, investments and stock repurchases. ", "Q4 net accounts receivable, totaled $123 million and our DSO's remained very healthy at 39 days. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $499 million, a slight increase sequentially. We expect this to increase again in Q1 similar to last year 's pattern due to a large customer scheduled to pay a year in advance.", "At the end of Q4, we had approximately 5,100 employees. This was a slight drop sequentially as we reduced our North American workforce by more than 2%, offset by hiring elsewhere. We also renewed our credit facility in Q4 and increased it to $300 million, also at much better terms. This revolver provides excellent flexibility in our business operations.", "In addition to the changes that Aart talked about, I'd like to give you just a few examples of the changes we made during the past year on the expense front. First, every function cut back on planned hiring in 2006. ", "Second, we've streamlined some of our infrastructure operations, outsourcing certain non-core functions and offshoring others. For example, we outsourced our entire procure to pay process to a best in class service provider that works with seven of the top ten Fortune 500 companies. Once this is fully implemented, we expect to save between $2 million and $5 million per year.", "We have continued our redeployment of certain functions. For example, some IT support was moved to some lower cost locations. We now have 30% of our employees in low cost regions, ahead of our plan. Not only does this provide us cost savings of approximately $4 million per year, but it moves us closer to our customers, allowing us to better meet their needs. ", "Third, we completed a thorough review of our international operations and tax structure. As a result of some structural changes we've made, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to drop from 32% in 2006 to between 28% and 29%. We're certainly not done. We'll continue to update you throughout the year on further changes we are making to improve our earnings power.", "Turning now to our financial targets in FY '07 and beyond; first some general commentary. Almost two years ago, we committed to passing a 20% operating margin during FY '07. We're confident that we'll reach this goal in the second half of this year. We expect revenue growth of between 8% and 10% in FY '07 with less than 10% of our business coming from up front orders. We expect to hold expenses down to just a slight increase in FY '07. As a result of cost controls and actions we've taken, we're almost entirely offset the upward pressure on expenses due to acquisitions, inflation and an extra fiscal week that occurs for us every seven years and that happens in Q1.", "Regarding our long-term operating model, as Aart mentioned, beyond '07 our next operating margin is in the mid to high 20s which we'll work to reach through a combination of sustainable revenue growth and expense control. Our goal is to limit expense growth to less than half of our revenue growth and this philosophy will allow us to both increase our profitability and provide future technology and business growth. As we increase our earnings power we'll grow our cash flow to higher levels as well. ", "Now on to the guidance. For the first quarter of FY '07, our targets are: ", "For fiscal 2007, our targets are:", "In summary, we had an excellent Q4 and fiscal 2006 and I'm really looking forward to the next year. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets. ", " Stuart Muter  - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon and congratulations on some nice numbers and guidance. First, in terms of business conditions, a question for Aart. We're hearing about a substantial slowdown in 65 nanometer wafer starts but there seems to be a fair bit of design activity. Could you talk a little bit about what you're hearing from your customers on 65 nanometers?", " Aart de Geus", " Sure. I think there is absolutely a difference between wafer starts and design activity largely because the design activity simply starts about two years before major wafer starts. I can tell you that if you look at the 65 nanometer designs that we're watching, it went up again considerably from last quarter. Last quarter, I think I reported that we were watching 243 designs, this quarter it's 282 and if you want to look at the tape-out account it went from 80 to 109 so that's moving forward actually quite well. By the way, we see exactly the same trend in 45 nanometer, of course on smaller numbers. ", "So, I've been watching this carefully now for a number of years and I'm very positive that on all of the advanced designs, the clock for new generation happens to be exactly two years and so there's no slowdown from that perspective.", " Stuart Muter  - RBC Capital Markets", " Okay, that's helpful. With the 45 nanometer activity that you see now, I'm sure it's pretty limited, but are you seeing the same kinds of demands? Is power a major driver or is there a new theme emerging on 45 nanometer?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, power became a fairly big issue at 90 nanometer, a bigger issue at 65 and a bigger issue at 45 and it's just accompanied with now an increased focus on yield variations in the design. We're getting closer and closer to physical phenomenon that before were negligible. I expect that to continue and as a matter of fact, we're already starting to track the first 32 nanometer designs which shows that the span of the most advanced developments is quite broad, and there will just be more of that.", "But you're absolutely right. Power is important. The other reason power is important of course, which is that the drive of consumer products is very, very strong in many of these advanced technologies and consumer products want to be portable.", " Stuart Muter  - RBC Capital Markets", " Excellent. If I can, a couple of questions for Brian. What do you think the expense guidance would be without that extra week? I mean, should I just do the math in terms of the percentage or would it be a little bit different?", " Brian Beattie", " Yes. You can do the math just based on the guidance for revenues and margins and the EPS numbers we gave you.", " Stuart Muter  - RBC Capital Markets", " Okay. The share count guidance, it's kind of ticking up. Is there anything going on there?", " Brian Beattie", " Well, our share count includes of course the impact of the 10 million shares we bought back in the year, but it's also a factor of looking at the numbers, we've bought back more than double the amount of new options or new stock issued during the year and we expect to continue that trend going forward. Another factor that comes in as well is as the price of the stock goes up, clearly there are more shares using the treasury stock method that are included in the denominator.", " Stuart Muter  - RBC Capital Markets", " Okay, excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Seth - Cowen & Co. ", " Raj Seth  - Cowen & Co.", " Thanks, Aart, a couple questions for you. First, a follow-up on Stuart's question about the strength in EDA. You talked about in your prepared remarks, I think you said EDA appears to be improving. Is this in your view something that really is indeed sustainable, or is this a cyclical trend around some of the node transitions we've just gone through? 65, 90 becoming mainstream, or is this EDA growing again consistent with R&D spending?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, I think it's probably fundamentally consistent with R&D spending; however, the node transitions have been coming across like clockwork in the last four or five years, so that I expect to continue. I think the definition of EDA has been broadening gradually because we're definitely spending much more attention to all the things that touch manufacturing, and you can view DSM as a subsegment, or you can say some of that is directly reflected in the core EDA. ", "Be it as it may, there's no way to do the advanced chips with some of the older tools at this point in time that don't take into account various forms of signal integrity and variation and DSM and this and that. So I expect that the investment level will have to continue for all the people that want to play.", " Raj Seth  - Cowen & Co.", " So more of a secular trend there than something cyclical?", " Aart de Geus", " I would think so. I've never been a strong advocate of cyclicality when you deal with design flow evolutions and design cycles that are much longer than the ups and downs of the semiconductor industry. Secondly, in addition to that we have a business model that is very much I would say three-year centric and so that makes for a very stable, steady industry.", " Raj Seth  - Cowen & Co.", "You mentioned in terms of your priorities for next year, you said something about sharpening segmentation, mentioned pricing and a move into the mainstream. Can you elaborate a little bit on what your objectives are there? What is it you're trying to do and maybe a bit about what you plan to do?", " Aart de Geus", " Sure. There's one common word to all of this, it's the word value . I think that we are strongly back into a position where on many fronts we're quite differentiated and our objective is to make sure that this differentiation gets translated in something that's both measurable and appreciated by the customers as helping them differentiate themselves.", "One way to do that is to know better what are the concerns of the customer and the other aspect is to know better what are the differentiations that you have internally and match the two. From that perspective, the increased focus on the centralized marketing will be one of the mechanisms to do that. ", "I think following up on that, we will then tune the sales approach, the go to market approach to be reflective of it. We feel that we have a lot of strong technology and we can probably do better at getting value for it.", " Raj Seth  - Cowen & Co.", " Do you expect, or should we expect that you'll tier your products in the way that Cadence has? Good, better, best? Is that the direction you're headed?", " Aart de Geus", " We've sort of always thought that all of our products were best but I understand what you're saying. The reality is that we have always had a tiering of products. There's always been Design Compiler and Design Compiler Ultra and in many products, there are additional ways to get additional functionality which is a form of tiering that is both a form of pricing and packaging but it's also a way of meeting the needs of those people that are at the very high end or are more in the mainstream. ", "Having said that, I think we can do better. A lot of this has been an almost 20-year-long evolution step by step and this is a good time to rethink entirely how we want to do it. I don't think that it is quite as simple as just saying well, there's a low, medium, and high end. I think it has to be understood more in terms of the needs of particular constituencies.", " Raj Seth  - Cowen & Co.", " Sure, that's helpful. Thanks, nice results.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley. ", " Harlan Sur  - Morgan Stanley", "Great job on the financial results. You talked about mixed fundamentals within the semiconductor industry. I think one of the near term bright spots has been the memory sector -- DRAM especially -- so maybe you can just refresh us as to how Synopsys has leveraged memory design activity and maybe some of the trends you're seeing in this segment of the market space.", " Aart de Geus", " Sure. Well, first, I think it's clear one of the reasons that memory is doing well is by the time you start looking at most content becoming video, you've just multiplied dramatically the amount of data, and I expect that to massively continue. It's interesting that I now see many of the semiconductor executives spend a great deal of attention on what happens with YouTube and why are these guys so interested in this? I think they are all smelling the fact that the video content is just an enormous driver. ", "Now, memory is sort of the obvious thing of which you have never enough and interestingly enough we actually do quite a bit of business in the memory segment. First and foremost, through our simulation and very fast simulation and now increasingly also through the DSM side of the equation and so this is a good example of a segment, if you can call it that, that may have very direct needs in terms of the products that we can provide and that we'll pay more attention to going forward.", " Harlan Sur  - Morgan Stanley", " Okay, great. As you see obviously more 65 nanometer design activity here in digital, where are your customers seeing the challenges as they tackle these complex designs? Is it timing closure related? Is it process variability? Multi node, multi corner analysis? Is it power? How would you rank those priorities?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, I'm tempted to just say yes. They are all sort of at max demand, partially because if they were not, immediately people would say well, why can I not do better? I'm increasingly of the mind that project length is almost fixed and then you just do the best you can with that. ", "Having said that, the center of gravity of all electronic design to date is timing, has been for the last 15 years because it brings together all of these phenomenon and all of these other things are almost like perturbations that you have to work through and so you will try to achieve your timing and then minimize the power, optimize as much as possible for the profit variation, the multi corner analysis, and others, all techniques that are used to achieve that. So design is definitely more complex, but people will always push this envelope of timing. For consumer designs, there is a high emphasis on cost and therefore, the area will remain key as people still try to push more and more onto fewer chips.", " Harlan Sur  - Morgan Stanley", "Along those same lines as you speak with your customers that are working on these 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer designs, is the percentage of silicon success going up or down relative to prior generations of technology?", " Aart de Geus", " It's a difficult question because the chips are substantially more complex and I think there are fewer of them, but all in all, the move to 55 nanometer has gone quite well because many people feel that the transition 90 to 65 was rather well executed from a manufacturing point of view. I think a transition to 45 will probably bring some tougher challenges as we are now talking about things like emersion and photolithography, et cetera. So there are a number of customers that have been working at 130 that have barely touched 90 and are essentially saying, can I go straight for 65? That's I think why this tempo is being kept up so well in terms of going to new generations.", " Harlan Sur  - Morgan Stanley", " Okay, great. Thank you, Aart.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams. ", " Dennis Wassung  - Canaccord Adams", " A few quick questions on some of the segments of the business here. First, if you look at the segment breakouts, and you actually had very strong growth across the Discovery platform, the IP, and DFM areas, but the Galaxy side of the business was only up about 2.5% year-over-year. Just any commentary you can give us on that side of the business? As you look forward, do you expect to see that line return to a more solid growth rate? Do you see IC Compiler driving that or is that just a market that has just been tough on the pricing and in terms of competition that's going to be hard to just maintain?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, we think it's the first, meaning that as IC Compiler starts to become a larger portion of the existing large technology pools that are in these deals, it will start driving Galaxy forward. Typically there's some delay between a major product and seeing the impact of it. We are expecting that in '07 you will therefore see a high growth rate on Galaxy because IC Compiler is doing very well.", " Dennis Wassung  - Canaccord Adams", "In past quarters you've talked about the transition of your customer base to IC Compiler. I think you mentioned that you've got over $100 million of bookings so far to date. Anything else you can give us in terms of quantification, how far along in terms of converting the installed base? Is there any metric you're working toward at this point?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, I think we told you about a year ago, even a little bit more, that we expected 80% conversion over a three-year period. We think that we're quite well on track with that, and so I think that we are going to see an acceleration now and the reason is that many of the people that are reporting good results with IC Compiler took 18 months to go through a complete design cycle. As they've done some sophisticated chips as the product simultaneously has matured substantially, they are now saying okay, this thing is ready for broader deployment, not just for the fighter pilots inside of a company. From that perspective, I think we're now entering the acceleration phase of adoption.", " Dennis Wassung  - Canaccord Adams", " Okay, and then when you look at some of the other segments of the business, the DFM side obviously has been a nice growth driver for you. I'm curious how that revenue kind of parses out. I know you don't break it out but I'm wondering if you're seeing a broadening of that revenue base across multiple areas and OPC is obviously a big driver, TCAD and some others but how would you classify that revenue picture today and how do you see it migrating over the next year?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, the very fact that we are so broadly and well represented in all of these segments is very helpful because at the limit, some of them do overlap and it's precisely that overlap that ultimately we think is a major asset for us as we link the complete loop from manufacturing back into design and vice versa. So our own thinking is that we have been able over the last few years to carve a position into the manufacturing area almost independently of the DFM, the design flow manufacturing, which is really the linkage, and we plan to push on both, the manufacturing and the DFM connection. Not independently, but with certainly interesting financial objectives in both.", " Dennis Wassung  - Canaccord Adams", " Okay and then the last question for me. You've alluded to pricing a couple of times and you talked about it in your prepared remarks, improving the pricing and being more diligent on pricing as you move forward. Any comments on the environment for pricing? Has it been the same as it has been over the last year or so and as you move toward this value methodology or further along that line, how do you plan to keep the pricing in place or improve pricing?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, I think all in all, the pricing has not materially changed one way or another and it's a little bit of the same story which is, if you had differentiation you can hold your pricing if you don't, then it becomes a cost equation. Having said, that I think that we have substantially increased our differentiation in the last 18 months, now we need to learn how to advocate the value that we are providing. ", "I do think that we're not the only ones in the EDA industry that are realizing that the value we do provide to the overall semiconductor industry is quite substantial and so I have good hopes that as an industry, we use the word value more often and set this into the right direction.", " Dennis Wassung  - Canaccord Adams", " Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company. ", " Matt Petkun  - D.A. Davidson", " Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions. First, Brian, I just wanted to clarify. You said that there were a few deals that you were able to hold off at the end of Q4 and continue working on now here in Q1. Then you also said in your commentary that you exceeded your target for Q4. I just wanted to clarify, did you exceed your internal bookings target for Q4?", " Brian Beattie", " Yes, we did.", " Matt Petkun  - D.A. Davidson", " Okay. And then also to clarify, you said you expect a book-to-bill above 1 for 2007?", " Brian Beattie", " That's correct too, yes.", " Matt Petkun  - D.A. Davidson", " Okay. A question for Aart then, just in terms of the strength that you're seeing, not just in terms of growth but also competitively in the verification space. Aart, what would you really point to in terms of your own internal technology there? Is it maybe better support for System Verilog, superior test bench technology, verification IP, why are you winning with VCS and with Discovery in general?", " Aart de Geus", " For the last 25 years it's been one word, speed. Now, speed is becoming more complex meaning that it's speed of many aspects but fundamentally, if you can verify a design faster than somebody else, given that there's almost no end to the needs in verification, that is how you win; and in many, many situations, we can actually demonstrate a 4X to 5X improvement over other solutions. ", "Now, having said that, we have simultaneously in the last couple of years invested substantially in the notion of debugging. So in the broader term that says well, if there are problems how do you find them? It's not just raw cranking through vectors. It is what you do with them, how do you analyze it, how do you find out the issues, and there are things such as much stronger language such as System Verilog but also many of the debugging mechanisms that have been built into the platform of high value, but at the end of the day, it's a little bit the horsepower of the car is where everything starts.", " Matt Petkun  - D.A. Davidson", "Last quarter, you announced Joe Logan heading up sales. I wonder if there is any changes you guys have made or are looking to make maybe internally in terms of sales and perhaps marketing and how maybe from a strategic perspective you've changed things? Or has Joe just basically taken over the new role of sales but not a lot of other strategic changes to how you guys are approaching global deals?", " Aart de Geus", " Sure. Joe has been very quick to align his organization and the yearly boundary is actually a very effective moment to do that because then you have all of the old quota that get finished for the past year and then you start fresh going forward. ", "I think that has been actually very electrifying to the sales team and as these changes now percolate through the organization, we're actually in the process of rolling out our plans for '07 and I think that's going quite well. ", "At the same time, you alluded to marketing and I mentioned that we had pulled out all the marketing out of all the BU's in the entire company, put it under one leader and there clearly the objective is to articulate our value more in terms of solutions given that from an engineering point of view, we have been working for now quite a while in making the things work well together, and we are seeing the technical benefits of that. We need to articulate the value that comes with it. ", "Finally putting the two together, John Shelton who runs marketing and Joe Logan in sales are aimed to be joined at the hip in making this happen in practice and there of course how we work with our customers, how we articulate better and deliver better the values at the essence of creating good growth.  Matt Petkun  - D.A. Davidson", " Okay, great. Thanks so much and congratulations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch. ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer  - Merrill Lynch", " Thanks, good afternoon. Aart, I'd like to ask you about the connection between the technology evolution you've undergone in the last few years towards more integrated platforms and your bookings profile. In other words, is the integration of multiple products biasing deal sizes larger? When you look back over 2006, for example, and the range of deal sizes which you had once described at an analyst meeting, are you in fact seeing more large deals on average as a result of technology completeness, let's say? ", " Aart de Geus", " I would think so because the completeness takes at a minimum two forms. One is that we actually have more capability than the sales force in back meaning that we go further into DFM, that we have additional capabilities around optimization and the other that we actually can demonstrate higher value, higher quality of results with the integration that we have done. As you all know, the integration was actually a fairly painful, long investment but it was more than integration. We've created a platform that is better set up for optimization of many different things from timing to area to power to DFM to test all at the same time.  I think we're now starting to see a rapidly increasing body of evidence that the quality of results is indeed better and that the overall effort to get there is reduced. Those are the two angles that really help the salespeople articulate the value.", " Jay Vleeschhouwer  - Merrill Lynch", " When you look at the business in the last year by product segment or with respect to your expectations for the next year, in which product areas or specific products did you see the most increase in net capacity or where might you see large increases in net capacity? Would it be IC Compiler or was that just a swap out of PC and Astro or are there other areas in which you are in fact seeing increases in licenses?", " Aart de Geus", "It's actually fairly across-the-board but there are areas that really stand out. Maybe the best example is actually verification because the complexity of the chips being built makes verification almost impossible, which sounds strange because chips still come out working pretty well. One of the reasons is because the amount of verification that's being done has grown incredibly in the last few years. Now, partially because the verification tools, the simulators have improved significantly, but partially also because of the number of simulators being used on large compute forms has grown substantially. ", "So that's a good example where you can clearly see the number of tools growing. And things like IC Compiler, it's too early to tell because we're in this replacement of PC Astro and then we'll see where that leads afterwards while simultaneously, the depth of the product is much higher, so there it's more of the advanced guys are now jumping on it and then we'll see how it percolates through the company.", " Jay Vleeschhouwer  - Merrill Lynch", " Following up on the earlier question with regard to segmentation, that might suggest more specialty or niche-type applications. Would that perhaps result in some smaller deals on average or are you targeting the segmented products like Cadence towards perhaps smaller design shops, fabless customers and the like, not necessarily the majors?", " Aart de Geus", " Not really. As much as it's desirable to go to all of the smaller shops, by the time you add it up, that's nothing compared to being able to make the difference on some of the medium or larger companies and really highlight better the value. So when we talk about value, we really want to put it in terms of how our customers differentiate. So if you can reduce the area of a chip by 10%, 15% and this happens to be a reasonably high volume chip, you have had a major impact on the cost, right? The same is true on any percentage change in manufacturing yield which is still a little harder to measure but we'll get there over the next few years. ", "It is stating those value propositions against how the customers view their own differentiation that I think we want to hone more and then make sure that we are really aligned in terms of presenting well what we have and listening well to what the customers need.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vashal Soluwa - Soleil. ", "Vashal Soluwa \u2013 Soleil", " Hi, thanks for taking my question. Aart, could you please give us a preview of you\u2019re your product flow in '07 might look like? Brian, on the issue of working some deals in Q4 and having them slip, can you give a sense of your level of confidence around ultimately being able to close those deals, hopefully at higher values?", " Aart de Geus", " Regarding the product flow, of course we don't communicate products that we aren't ready to announce, but the best way maybe to respond is to look at how the landscape will shift in terms of the design starts that utilize many tools, and so there's no doubt in my mind that in '07, we're going to now see a substantial increase in 65 nanometer designs and we're going to see a substantial increase of work around 45 nanometer. When I say work, there's a lot of people that are doing the initial cores on 45 and are tuning their 45 nanometer rolls and libraries and all of this is preparing for then ultimately going there with full production. ", "So if you look at 65 and 45, the word power absolutely comes to mind over and over again, but so does the word yield and therefore the connection to DFM will start to increase in importance as it manifests itself in our tools.", " Brian Beattie", "Relative to the deal flow, we're very confident that the deals we're working at the end of the year will get closed. We're aiming hard to get those closed specifically in this quarter. Again, it's really used as a highlight of our ratable business model that the fact that we had 95% of that business coming from backlog this quarter, it tells you when you get to the end of the quarter, in our case, the end of the year that the pressure to close the deal for the quarter, having minimal impact on revenues, allows both parties to get the most value from the agreement and so in that case, we just keep working this one through and are very confident we're going to close it in the short-term.", "Vashal Soluwa \u2013 Soleil", "Thanks a lot. Great quarter.", "Operator", "We currently have five minutes left in the conference. Would you like to entertain one more question?", " Aart de Geus", " Give us one more question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - JP Morgan. ", " Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", " Brian, in terms of the margin improvement that you look at through '07, should that progress linearly through the year or do you think you get a step function in the second quarter and then you hit the 20% goal in the third quarter?", " Brian Beattie", " Yes. We indicated the 20% exceed number is in the second half of 2007, so it's something that we've given specific guidance for the Q1 and expect to be over 20% in the second half and track upward from there.", "  Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", " Okay, but again, you made some comment about a significant step down in expenses in the second quarter; is that correct ?", " Brian Beattie", " Yes, that's right.", " Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "What do you expect for CapEx in '07?", " Brian Beattie", " Well, in our case, it's about flat year-over-year, so this year we came in at about $48 million.", " Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "As you look at the business that you did in '06, how much of that would you of classify as taking the renewals or existing customers and selling more seats into existing projects or teams? How much of that would you say was further expansion and gaining presence within those customers?", " Aart de Geus", " Well, by definition, the world of customers is actually reasonably well defined, although there are still new companies popping up. Financially, they don't hit the radar scope very quickly. It just takes time for them to grow, if they do. Having said that, therefore, most of the business is coming from existing customers and I think the expansion is both in the core EDA largely because our main engines, the Synthesis and the verification are all doing quite well, but then there's also the expansion down towards the DFM which is new for a number of customers and by the way also up into the IP. ", "IP I think will be one of those steady growers because people need more and more IP blocks that become harder and harder to build which doesn't mean that some can't build them themselves but for many buy versus build, they are so much better off buying if they can trust the IP and I think we have high reliability, high quality IP today. ", "So that's how I see this developing and I think the good relationships that we have with many customers are very conducive to be able to introduce them to new technologies.", " Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", " So the growth is more than just hiring on to teams that are already using Synopsys tools. You're saying it's expansion of some of the new tools and the new areas and garnering more seats in other areas of those customers?", " Aart de Geus", "Absolutely, yes. ", " Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", " Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "With that I'll turn the conference back over to you for any closing comments you may have.", " Aart de Geus", " Sure. Well, I appreciate your time as usual. I think we're looking back on a strong year '06 that in many ways concludes somewhat one phase of the company. As a little aside highlight, in a couple of weeks we will have our 20th anniversary and for fun, I tracked where we were in technology 20 years ago and we have literally gone through ten generations of Moore's Law which is 1,000X in complexity. While I'm a little hesitant to say let's go for the next 1,000X, we hope to have you on calls in the future.

Earnings Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Kerrie. Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. ", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our first quarter fiscal year 2007 earnings release. ", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in our first quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at Synopsys.com. ", "With that I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. ", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I am happy to report that after a very successful 2006, we continued our excellent execution with a strong first quarter of 2007. In Q1, we delivered excellent revenue and earnings growth, solid cash flow and strong business across the board. On the product side, momentum continued with technology advances, competitive wins, and customer adoptions. ", "Let me briefly summarize our financial highlights. Business was strong across all product lines. Revenue for the quarter was $300.2 million, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Non-GAAP expenses for the quarter came in at $247.1 million, well within our target range. We made excellent progress, on increasing our earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.7% for the quarter, significantly strengthening our confidence in reaching our target of 20 plus percent during the second-half of the year. Non-GAAP earnings in Q1 were $0.30 per share, a 65% increase over the same period, last year. ", "The reason for our continued strong results stems from our clear focus in recent years. One, implementing the most predictable and transparent business model in the industry. Two, systematically growing a culture of cost management. Three, delivering important core products, around a well integrated set of platforms. And four, building strong positions in adjacent growth markets. ", "Starting with the operational efficiency of the company, let me highlight some specific improvements. We have streamlined many of our infrastructure operations, including outsourcing procurement and accounts payable. We have organized some of our field operations to serve our customers in a more cost effective way. We've increasingly started projects in low cost regions when appropriate, and we are systematically tuning our internal processes in search of additional cost efficiencies. ", "For the foreseeable future, we will keep expense growth of less than half the rate of revenue growth, to drive towards the post '07 objective of mid to high 20's operating margin. With cost control now clearly part of our culture, our focus has turned to revenue growth through technology innovation and new go-to-market strategies. ", "As a backdrop for our opportunities, let me give you a sense of the market environment. The semiconductor industry continues to evolve. The market feels quite solid, as consumer hunger for electronics continues unabated. Consumer demand creates many opportunities for our customers of course, but also tough technical and economic challenges. Take the latest mobile products; a phone now also contains a music player and a camera, and a video display and GPS and Wi-Fi access, all in a small package with a long battery life. ", "The challenges are tremendous, huge amounts of constantly increasing functionalities, top flow power requirements for mobile battery use and heat minimization, high cost sensitivity accelerated by demand in global markets and tight market windows demanding faultless product scheduling and delivery. These challenges are opportunities for Synopsys. We've always been leaders in optimizing speed, power and area, with our design and verification platforms. ", "Our design for manufacturing solutions, predictably and safely move designs into the complex phase of high volume manufacturing. Simultaneously, our IP and system tools, squarely attack the productivity challenges of very complex designs. ", "A good example of our differentiation success is Wolfson Microelectronics, a global leader in mixed-signal chips. After an extensive evaluation of competitive solution, Wolfson selected Synopsys for their high performance analog mixed-signal chip, because of our complete implementation, verification and IP Solution, which brings me to the products highlights for the quarter. ", "Starting with Core EDA; Galaxy, our implementation platform, had another strong quarter. The productivity benefits of an integrated platform are increasingly visible, as the three components of Galaxy, synthesis, physical design, and sign-off, melt seamlessly in to the highest performing digital design flow. ", "Nowhere is this more tangible, than with the number one design problem, low power. Synopsys today delivers the most complete solution on the market and our service and support chains are highly qualified to assist customers in advanced low power designs. As an example, Cypress Semiconductor used our complete integrated Galaxy Low Power Solution to tape-out the complex 3G/3.5G mobile phone chip. ", "One reason for our strong results is our continued commitment to technical innovation. In Design Compiler Ultra, for example, we have the industry's only topographical synthesis technology. It lets our synthesizer predict what the downstream physical design will look like, thus eliminating many costly design iterations. ", "As an example, FP has deployed DC Ultra in its 90 and 65 nanometer ASIC design flow, to speed up the design cycle for both its internal design groups and for external customers. ", "In Q1, DC Ultra won literally all benchmarks, resulting in multiple competitive displacements. ", "In physical design, IC Compiler had another excellent quarter as well. The product ramp is right on-track with evaluation, tape-out and production adoptions all increasing. Designers continued to report 40% to 50% faster time-to-result and 8% to 10% better quality of results. These statistics are compelling customers to choose Synopsys for physical design. ", "For example, after a detailed competitive review, Silicon Optix selected IC Compiler for its 90 nanometer video processor design. Progate, one of the largest design service providers in Taiwan used IC compilers to tape-out an advanced mobile communications chip ahead of schedule. ", "Let me now move to Discovery, our analog and digital verification platform, which also did very well. As we've highlighted for the past year, the demand for verification is exploding, as massive chip complexity requires faster and more comprehensive bug finding. We foresaw and in fact led the movement towards a speedier verification language, System Verilog. Simultaneously, we invested in a much faster verification solution, VCS, our core digital simulator. ", "We're now seeing the return on these investments, as VCS is driving excellent business for us. Renesas is a good example. It's one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, focused on mobile, automotive and audio/visual markets. Renesas adopted VCS for its next generation of advanced chips, in networking, peripheral and consumer applications. ", "Demand for analog mixed-signal verification also continues to grow. Here too, we are innovating and Synopsys remains the clear choice for superior performance and productivity. As a result, we delivered another very strong quarter for analog mixed-signal verification. ", "Turning now to our high-growth adjacency, let's look first at design for manufacturing. The physics of smaller geometries, especially, in 65 and 45 nanometers are causing unavoidable problems. To guarantee good yield and thus good profitability for advanced products, DFM is now mandatory. Our investments in the recent years have put us in leadership position. We've grown strong positions on both the design and the manufacturing side and are now systematically linking the two. ", "We are the only company with true end-to-end visibility. We're deeply engaged with the design community, with the mask shops, the process development teams and with the fabs doing the manufacturing. By bringing data from the fab up into the design process, we can anticipate and mitigate potential manufacturing issues, during design, and thus improve the resulting yield. ", "On the design side of DFM, our new franchise sign-off solution, successfully modeled variability and manufacturing. We're now seeing the first real chips using a variation-aware PrimeTime VX. ", "PrimeYield, our integrated design-to-manufacturing solution, is moving through its maturation process and its connection to IC Compiler is driving business for both. For example, a large Japanese semiconductor company adopted PrimeYield for 65 nanometer, driven in large part by its link to IC Compiler. ", "On the manufacturing side, there's good progress as well. Customer reaction to our new process-aware DFM Solutions, has been excellent and our TCAD continues to perform very well. We displaced a competitor at a major foundry in China, as we consolidated their TCAD business on Synopsys. ", "On the lithography side, we won a key competitive benchmark on the 65 nanometer design due to better accuracy and speed. We're also seeing success with our new advanced 3D lithography simulation tools; in one case, displacing the competition at a large wireless chip supplier. ", "Moving up to our other adjacency system level design, our investments in IP are bearing fruit. ", "Today, Synopsys is the clear leader in analog and digital connectivity IP. Our products span all the key standards such as USB, wireless USB, PCI Express and others. ", "For our customers, make or buy decisions for IP are increasingly contemplated, as a time-to-market benefit, as well as the risk and cost advantages are more and more evident. Selection of an IP partner is based mainly on the performance and the quality of the available IP. Our years of systematic investments in very high quality IP, are now really paying off. Our analog USB cores for example, are in more than 200 million chips, primarily in consumer electronics. ", "Let me now turn to our key objectives going forward. One, we are continuing our strong operational cost management. Two, we are increasing our focus on technology innovation. And three, we are reenergizing our go-to-market approach with a clear objective of revenue growth. ", "Towards this end, we made substantial organizational changes last year, which we completed in Q1 with the appointment of Wolfgang Fichtner, as head of the Silicon Engineering Group. We now have five energized business groups with strong leaders, including a new analog mixed-signal business unit. We have centralized all marketing functions. We have combined the design services and support, and we have new sales leadership in place with a strong commitment to driving growth. Again, the uniquely high visibility business outlook and with renewed vitality in our team, our objectives for this year is to completely revisit our go-to-market strategy. ", "Clearly, we and the rest of the EDA industry are delivering essential value to our customers. With fresh thinking ranging from better advocacy to creative segmentation and packaging to innovative product development, our goal overtime is to increase the return that we get for the value we deliver. We look forward to sharing with you some details on our progress at our Investor Day in late March. ", "In conclusion, Q1 started 2007 with great execution. We delivered strong financial results in terms of revenue, earnings growth, solid cash flow and very good business across the board. We're seeing excellent technology in product momentum and we're making progress on our new initiatives to drive increased value. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, who will provide for detail on the financials. ", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thanks Aart. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We provided a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. Q1 was another strong quarter for Synopsys. We continued to execute well against our financial targets and expand our earnings power. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin, rose almost 300 basis points sequentially to 17.7%. And earnings per share were $0.30, an increase of 65% over last year. ", "Now let me provide some additional details. As a reminder Q1 included an extra fiscal week that occurs every seven years. Total revenue was $300.2 million, up 6% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Compared to last year, core EDA, which composed of Galaxy Design and Discovery Verification, grew more than 12%. Our high growth adjacencies, DFM and IP, grew 27% and 39% respectively. Professional Services grew 8%. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our Q1 revenue. GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 in Q1 with costs and expenses totaling $280 million. This included $30 million of amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.30 in Q1 above our targets due to strong execution and the lower than expected tax rate. Non-GAAP expenses were $247.1 million, an expected increase, due mainly to the extra fiscal week. Excluding this extra week, our expenses would have been lower than Q4, of 2006. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 17.7% in Q1 and we're well on track to reaching 20% plus in the second half of this year. ", "The non-GAAP tax rate was 23% in Q1, eight percentage points lower than last quarter. Now about half of the draft was from optimizing our international operations and the remainder was due to a one time R&D tax credit. As a result, we are able to lower our annual tax-rate guidance as well. ", "We continue to have one of the most transparent and predictable business models in software. With 95% of Q1 product orders booked as time-based licenses and 5% booked as upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments remained healthy at approximately three years. ", "Turning now to cash. Our operating cash flow was $56 million in Q1. Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments increased $107 million sequentially to $680 million. This increase was driven by increased option exercises and in annual payment made by one large customer. ", "In Q1, we purchased 700,000 shares of our stock for $18 million and have approximately $219 million left on our authorization. Our diluted share count increased 6 million shares during Q1, primarily as a result of a higher stock price. Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $141 million and DSO's were 46 days well within our historical range. ", "Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $584 million and expected increase to the large annual payment that I just mentioned. And as we've seen in the last several years, we expect deferred revenues to decline through the year and this payment rolls in the revenue. ", "At the end of Q1, we had approximately 5,100 employees a slight drop sequentially. In a second quarter in a row we reduced our headcount, as we continue to tightly manage our resources. From a broader perspective we continue to drive cost control initiatives throughout the company. ", "As we mentioned last quarter we have outsourced our entire procure-to-pay function and off shored a number of IT functions as well. We have also begun studying virtually all of our policies, everything from travel to cell phones to consulting fees, all designs control expenses and you will have to reallocate those resources to drive our new growth initiatives. ", "Now for the guidance. For the second quarter of FY '07 our targets are revenue between $285 million and $295 million. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $255 million and $276 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $230 million and $245 million. Other income and expense items between 0 and $5 million. A non-GAAP tax rate between 27% and 28%. Outstanding shares are expected to be between $145 million and $151 million. GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.17 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.29 per share. ", "We expect more than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. For fiscal 2007, we're raising a bottom end of our revenue range with our new target between $1.185 billion and $1.205 billion. A non-GAAP tax rate between 26% and 27% an improvement of 200 basic points from our previous guidance due to the R&D tax credits we mentioned earlier. Outstanding shares between $145 million and $151 million. GAAP earnings per share between $0.64 and $0.77, which includes the impact of approximately $70 million of stock based compensation expense. We are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share range by $0.03 with the new target of between $1.23 and $1.31. ", "We continue to expect to hold our non-GAAP expenses down to just a slight increase in FY \u201907. Over the next four quarters we expect approximately $980 million of our beginning of quarter backlog to turn to revenues. We expect cash flow from operations to be greater than $275 million. In summary we continue to execute well in Q1. With strong results I am looking forward to the rest of the year. And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, (Operator Instructions). And first we will go to the line of Harlan Sur of Morgan Stanley. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon. Good job on the quarter, Aart despite a mixed environment for many of your customers I think the move to 65 nanometers appears to be in full force. And with many of these customers having a step up to R&D spend fairly significantly. First, can you just maybe update us on the number of 65 nanometer design starts and tape-outs you are track in the first quarter. And then secondly as it relates to the step up in the R&D spend I am seeing with your customers I am just wondering how much of that is related to EDA product spend in your view versus just larger design teams, higher mask tooling costs, etcetera? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, first of all regarding the design tape-outs we continue to track those and so for 65, you are absolutely right. The numbers are growing now quite rapidly, we are tracking 373 active designs and 151 tape-outs so far. And by the way, we're seeing pretty rapid growth from 45 nanometers as well, with 47 active designs and several tape-outs. And so that's moving along just fine. You may have noticed also that a number of semiconductor vendors are literally looking at how to reallocate their R&D spending, because as some of them have decided to the more fab light, it's undoubtedly because they're now looking at differentiating more on the design side. And so I would not be surprised if we saw gradually the EDA portion grow, because after all EDA is what allows you to differentiate on the design side. My guess is that the entire EDA industry is already feeling some of that. We certainly did very well, based on being close to the leading-edge design. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "So Aart, sounds right, so you said 373 cumulative design starts? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah. Active designs. We track all the active designs that go to -- ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "That's a big jump up from the previous quarter. I think a 30% jump up. ", "Aart de Geus", "32% actually. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Okay. So activity is pretty robust, it seems like. ", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, it is. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "My next question is, as the industry moves more towards the fabless business model, what is the longer term impact as it relates to your DFM business. The manufacturing base is clearly shrinking. I'm just wondering, does it have a positive, neutral or negative impact as it relates to the DFM opportunity in your view? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well clearly, it's the realization that developing new technology is not an easy thing. And that will bring about more utilization of the DFM tools, especially at an age where the DFM simulation capabilities are now some of the economically rivaling well, what it would cost to go through experimentation. But in other words, anytime that you can take a process or a device and simulate it, rather than test and build it, you can save a lot of money. So that's good for us. ", "Secondly, I do think that we will see gradually a consolidation around certain number of centers of excellence that we already work with. But many of our customers are going to rely more and more on us to help them have a safe bridge into manufacturing, so to speak. But in other words, where we provide the mechanisms and the data coming from manufacturing that allows them to, if not predict, at a minimum, optimize the yield. And so in that sense I think we're very well anchored at that place. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great Aart, thanks. And then one last question for you, Brian. I know that the team was still working on a few deals exiting Q4, so I guess did you close those deals and did you get the economics you were looking for in the first quarter? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, we did. There were a number of deals that were on the table at the end of the quarter. And those closed the first quarter or so in good shape. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Great, all right. Thank you very much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Thank you, good afternoon. Aart, I was just wondering if you could talk about the competitive dynamics in the fast SPICE simulation market. I am sure you know Magma has a new product in that area. And it's an area that you're very strong in, through a couple of different product areas. Can you just talk about how you see that market in general and how significant it is, and if there is any change in the competitive landscape there? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, I think in general, verification has clearly grown more rapidly in terms of need, as anything else because it follows a sharper curve than Moore's Law. And that applies certainly also to the analog, and analog mixed-signal arena. I don't think that I've ever heard of Magma having anything in that area. I knew they had purchased something, I believe, but the main competitors really, are clearly Cadence and Mentor for us. But in verification, we do very, very well. And we see a broad set of applications ranging from the very high definition accuracy spikes, that solution all the way to the very fast spikes, all of those have been growing well for us. And our areas that we continue to invest in from an innovation point of view, so I would say that's an area to stay tuned on. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "All right, and then just with respect to Galaxy, it had been pretty modest growth in the last couple of quarters of last year and it looks like you saw some decent year-over-year growth this quarter. Is that what you would expect of for the balance of the year you expect to see Galaxy continue to grow at a pretty decent clip as you get that IC Compiler rolling out over the course of the year? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. We had said all along that IC Compiler had been doing pretty well. It takes time until you see that in the numbers when you have a multiyear business model. And of course at times it competes a little bit directly with our verification that often is bought at the same time that customers buy all of our core EDA tools. But IC Compiler having done very well, it will help Galaxy and I believe you're starting to see that through the numbers this year already higher than certainly last year. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Brian, how should we think about the longer term tax rate? Should we think about it more like your second quarter guided tax rate than your full-year tax rate here because you have hit that one-time R&D? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, that's right. Clearly the impact of the first quarter does translate the benefits for our full-year tax rate and that's what we've factored into our guidance. I think on an ongoing basis, we say that 27% to 28% for the second quarter is appropriate for us. And it should stay in that range over the next three years. Something in the next, the high 20s, let's say, is the range that we're going to be aiming at. That's really there as a result of the work we did in restructuring some of our international operations and also getting this R&D tax credit approved by the government at the end of 2006, I think was November. So that has allowed us to capture that impact for all of '06 and get factored into the Q1 numbers. So the overall year it's pretty significant improvement from that 32% that we saw effectively in place for all of 2006. So now it's a 4% or 5% improvement ongoing. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Great, one more just quick one if I could. With respect to the share count, you saw the big jump this quarter as the stock moved up. Assuming the stock was level let's say for the next quarter, would you expect to be in there buying shares and maybe bring that share count down a bit again back towards the mid 140s level? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah. Rich, as I mentioned, the impact this quarter really was primarily related to the price. So therefore with our treasury stock method, we have more shares that we have more options that we count in that fully diluted basis. So going forward again, we are very committed to a buyback program. We've been very active with our buyback over the past few years, very high percentage of our cash flow being dedicated to that. So we're still committed to buybacks. Again we'll do what we can to minimize those shares outstanding and provide those return to shareholder that we expect. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Merrill lynch. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, good afternoon. Aart, could you elaborate on what you mean by fresh thinking about the go-to-market model and your focus on revenue growth? I guess the multipart question is. What do you think your organic growth can or should be? As backdrop, you've probably seen that we've calculated for the top three vendors in the group, Synopsys from 2000 to 2006 appears to have had the slowest compound average growth in book-ins in the low single digits. Your next 12-month revenue backlog was flat sequentially at 980, and according to your 10-K, your largest customer modestly reduced its spending with you, 2006 versus 2005. Maybe that's anomaly, given how big they are. I guess the point is, what, what kind of an uplift you think you can or should achieve given the last six years or so of average history? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, commenting on your editorial. Clearly, the objective for us is to take advantage of the, the positive news we see out of all of our technology investments. For the last four or five years we've made many changes to the Company. Obviously, the most profound one is the business model from the financial side, but from a technology point of view, we have not only invested in complete platforms and new tools within it, that I think are doing quite well right now. We've also broadened our position to adjacent markets. Much of that has been investment very much from the technology side. And we've realized that the value that we provide to many of our customers is quite substantial. And so that begs the question, can we do better in how we roll out these technologies going forward? And we have dedicated this year to try to reanalyze how do we do business? How can we be better at getting return for that? Now, in many of the areas that we have invested in, actually or business is up. And at the end of the day, the only metric of success is the revenue. And for this year, I think, so far we've done certainly very well and last year we did quite well. So I expect that we will be able to continue on that track. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Brian, could you comment on your book to bill in the quarter? Was it above one or below one? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. We're not commenting on specifically in the quarter. It was a good quarter. We're very happy with the performance and the way that came through. Also, to clarify on your point of the next four quarters, we said we had $980 million of revenue already booked for the quarter. That also, as you must know, excludes that extra week we had in the first quarter, right. So, the number is the same but you really have an extra week in the first number, so the 980 does really represent a nice increase over the next four quarters, about 8% there. The other thing, again, keeping in mind our book to bill for 2007, we've already indicated that that will be a positive number and, therefore, you can see that the bookings are expected to be pretty strong with a nice growth on a year-over-year basis. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "And then lastly, over the years, you've made obviously a number of acquisitions besides Avanti, Numerical and Silicon, what was left of Monterey and so forth, Vertio, any way you could describe the of return you think you've gotten in the aggregate, Aart, from all those various investments in terms of returns, market share, revenue, et cetera? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, absolutely. I think many of these acquisitions made it possible for us to build strong positions in adjacent markets. And probably the best example of that is actually the DFM arena, because that's an area that has grown very rapidly, is very complex. And I think, today we have by far the most complete solution there in terms of touching all of the pieces and now having the opportunity to close the loop there. And of course on one hand, we want to maximally invest internally. At the same time, sometimes new technologies do emerge at other places and we're certainly not hesitant to use M&A as appropriate. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Aart. Thanks, Brian. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to Terence Whalen of Citigroup. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. My question relates to; in December, we had a meeting, introducing new heads of sales in marketing. In that meeting you mentioned that you would take more of a portfolio oriented approach in managing product development. And I just wanted to know if there were any preliminary conclusions in doing that product portfolio analysis? And I have a follow-up? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yes in many ways this also attaches a little bit to Jay's question of the whole go-to market approach. I think we're becoming increasingly sensitized that by looking at our own product portfolio, there are probably many ways to package and price things better. Roll them out more appropriately for certain segments that have specific needs. And potentially expand a little bit more away from not doing only the top ends, which we catered to very, very well, but gradually also to a little bit more of what some people would call the mainstream. So, all of these things are in fairly rapid evolution. It's a little bit one of those, once you put your attention to it, you learn more every time you look more. And in that sense, it feels like we're really changing the company. ", "I do think that it will take this year to become much more proficient on that, but it's a good time, because it's a time where the entire EDA industry has an opportunity to almost become more conscious of the value that it provides. And so that's a good time to rethink. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Thanks, Aart. And then I have a follow-up for Brian. Brian, you made some nice progress on the operating margin side this year. Clearly, the 20% for fiscal '07 for the second half looks very achievable. I was hoping a comment, looking beyond that, you have a goal of above 25% mid-to-high 20s. Is that goal for fiscal '08 specifically, or is it simply beyond fiscal '07? Thank you. ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, you are welcome Terence. It is a target for us, which is our next target. So as you recall, we've set the greater than 20% earlier and we're on track for that as we mention in '07. And then for the targets for our next area, we'll be in the mid-to-high 20s that we set. So specifically, it's not 2008 targeted, something that's beyond '07, that's what the whole company is focused on driving for. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Raj Seth of Cowen & Company. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Hi, thanks, just a couple of quick ones. Aart, you've talked a lot about value, getting better value for products, etcetera. You seem to want to avoid the word price. I'm just curious if, do you feel like you're getting better pricing. Is pricing improving in this industry? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, I think there's always price pressure because of course there is competition and they provide a lot of value as well. Maybe the reason that I like to emphasize the word value more than price is that if you only talk about price, you end up very quickly within a stuck budget, where the customer has one primary objective, which is lower is better. Whereas, if you talk about value, you can start thinking about what are all the things that we do that really increase the differentiation, could reduce their costs downstream, for example, could reduce their costs sideways in other groups, etcetera. And I'm just surprised myself that as we start to do this more and more, how little we've done of it in the past. And partially maybe it's because we're coming out of a long period of time, literally, multiple decades where just, faster tools, or slightly better tools was always the right next step. And I think right now, we should take a more economic look at how our customers can do well. And if we can engage with them on that basis, our opportunity, our tam, clearly can increase. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "A couple others if I might. You mentioned strength in 65 nanometer starts and tape-outs and then 45 was beginning. In general, is the infrastructure there for most of your customers to do design at 45 or is that another wave of investment that starts? And if so, when does that start for the mainstream? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, clearly, for most people, 45 nanometer is one bridge too far. And today, many people are just getting into 65. The fact that there's so many designs, means that those that really need it, and they tend to be people doing very advanced chips and chips that are very high volume. They have really race car driving designers. So, with the [rest] it follows a little later. So, 65 is really now the wave that is moving into production, I would say. 45 from my perspective is at least another 18 months out before you see broad production. But you can never generalize from the total to an individual customer, because some people really are trying to differentiate. And by the way, we're already engaged and working with a number of people at 32 nanometer. So there's a spread among the customers. But I would say the move from 90 to 65 is really where the bulk of the action is today. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "And so, if tape-outs start 18 months from now, you used a different word than tape-outs. But at 45 does that imply, given design cycles of around a year that within six, nine months, people need to begin to put in the capability to do design at 45, and that drives a little bit of a cycle in EDA or am I reading that wrong? ", "Aart de Geus", "No, you're reading it right. What it means is that the people that will need it first already started about 6 months ago. And so we're already well involved with many, many libraries, with many, many design rules for 45 nanometer for quite a while. I think at the same time for those people that are aiming towards, let's say production in 18 months, they are really starting to become serious about it. I would say this summer and fall. And so you see, again, this spread out the most advanced people being always the ones that will also invest first in some of the technology-specific needs. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Right. Last one for Brian. Brian, you've talked a little bit about buybacks, etcetera. How do you think about the appropriate capital structure for a company like this? Now that margins are getting back to where they've been, you're starting to gush cash. How much cash do you need to run a business like this? It doesn't seem like you'd need $600 million. ", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, we continue to look at that and try to optimize our capital structure. It is very, very strong balance sheet right now, with no debt, with a very strong position on cash flows being generated. So we're in a very good position. I'd highlight as well, though, as I said, if you looked on a percentage of cash flow generated, we are one of the highest companies in the area related to the amount of buyback we do as a ratio to that amount of operating cash flow we generate. So we are already up there. And as you know, we bought $200 million worth of stock last year and that was over 10 million shares, which is more than twice the amount that we issued through the programs of option grants or stock units and so on. So that has been our approach over the last year and we continue to focus in on that. But, we're going to continue to look at all the different opportunities for us and positive use of that cash, whether it's for investments in our operations, our buyback is really strong, or whether that required for M&A, all of it again focused on how we can support the growth for the Company. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Would you ever consider taking on some debt and buying back a lot of stock? Cadence has got, obviously a different structure here, where net cash is lower, and it seems to be a trend in a lot of companies, especially those that have cash generation profiles like yours. Is that something you'd ever consider, even more aggressive buybacks and maybe taking on some debt to do that, or no? ", "Brian Beattie", "We, of course, are approached by a lot of people with the offering. There's a lot of capabilities available to do that. And all of those are at our use, and our discretion, if and when we decide to use it. So I think we're in pretty good shape. We'll continue to valuate those best uses of our cash. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Thanks, appreciate it. ", "Brian Beattie", "All right. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Matt Petkun of D.A. Davidson & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Hi there, Aart. Just as a follow-on to your conversation with Raj, about the transition to 45 and what you're seeing at 65, would it be fair to say, our is it perhaps too soon to say that the transition from 65 to 45 should be a little bit easier than the transition from 90 to 65 has been? ", "Aart de Geus", "I don't think so. I think that the transition from 90 to 65, although challenging, went reasonably well, and as a matter of fact, we've even seen some customers go straight from 130 to 65 because they really like what they heard about 65. I think 45 is a different kettle of fish. I think, now we're talking about the geometries that have a lot of physical side effects that have high degree of valuability, and it remains to be seen exactly what the power issues are going to be. You may have heard that there's been some interesting new announcements around new materials to reduce leakage. But these announcements on top of what is already a very big leakage problem. And so, I think that 45 will be quite challenging. But the good news is now we have already taped out the chips so, as usual, so far, we're the enabler to Moore's Law. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then, of on your earlier comments, and another caller asked about the payback that you've been getting in M&A. How successful do you think the M&A in your IP business has been in terms of return on investment? And we've seen a little bit of a flatline in that line item over the last couple of quarters. Should we expect more M&A to fuel future growth in that business? Do you need to achieve more critical mass? Or do you feel pretty comfortable where you are in that business? ", "Aart de Geus", "So, I think that our IP strategy actually has been very successful including a number of small acquisitions that we have done there. Because we've been able to systematically bring these acquisitions up in terms of the quality. Most of these companies that sell IP fail all on the same thing, which is they sell very cheap something that's of poor quality and the customer pays a momentous price afterwards. We have really changed that. So today, we've been able to build the second largest IP business behind ARM, which is of course very specialized on processor cores. And I think that this position will be very valuable to keep growing with. As a matter of fact, over a longer period of time, we actually have seen our IP grow quite well. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "How successful do you think, I know ARMs a partner but, how successful do you think they've been with their physical library? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, it added an angle to their business that was really beyond what the processors had done. They've been able to focus on a few areas, especially by the way, working with Synopsys on low power, specifically, that have been quite interesting. It's not for me to comment, really, on their sub-businesses, overall ARM is very strong partner of Synopsys and the company that we certainly admire for what they've been able to do overall. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then last question, Brian, just of looking at your guidance for next quarter, it implies of at the midpoint a flattish operating margin. Maybe a little bit down but relatively flattish. I'm wondering, which line items you might expect to see a reduction in expenses in? Should we see R&D flattish or down on an absolute basis, or is there going to be more leverage in sales and marketing? ", "Brian Beattie", "I'd characterize when you take all the elements of our Q2 guidance into alignment that you've got to recognize that there's one week less of revenues, one week less of expenses. And as a result, you might see a little bit of downward pressure from Q1 just associated with that extra week in the accounting process. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "You don't get a week less of revenue? ", "Brian Beattie", "You do, yes. A week less revenue and a week less of expenses than the first quarter. So, considering revenues are greater than expenses that generally translates into a little bit lower guidance that we provided for Q2. We're seeing 26 to 29 compared to the 30 that we did in the first quarter. That's only related to the week. If you really look at the expenses, and get into the details of it, taking into that account, the mid point of our expense range is quite a bit lower than the first quarter. So, therefore, you see the impact of all these programs that we're talking about relative to getting that cost down and keeping the expenses tight. And continuing on track to be greater than 20% operating margin in the second half of this year. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Brian Beattie", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And next we'll go to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Market. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Just to follow up on that operating margin question. Sir, would you be able to get 20% operating margin by keeping the expenses flat for to second half or do you have to cut the costs to get to the 20% operating margin or better than 20%? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, I'd say again, our impact on spending in 2007, we're holding everything to a very slight increase compared to 2006. And that's even with this extra week if you want to be picky as an extra 2% of spending on a year-over-year basis. So we're keeping it very tight year-to-year. And of course then when you combine that with the revenue growth that we provided for guidance, obviously, drive revenue up, drive costs down, all of it drives it's greater than 20% margin very significant impact on a year-over-year basis. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "And then the question for Aart, in your IP strategy, are you considering any to enter into the new market in the connectivity arena like HDMI for the consumer product? Is that something we should look to? ", "Aart de Geus", "We are always looking at all of the new markets as they appear. And it's invariably slightly tricky question to know exactly when to jump and when not. Because, on one hand you want a standard to be sufficiently standard so that we can actually sell many copies. On the other hand, you want to be early enough to be the chosen one that can really grow the position first. And so, I think at this point of time we have a pretty well honed engine of continually looking at a portfolio of IP that we have plus the portfolio of potential IP, and then invest just in time, so to speak, to make sure that we have very high quality IP. And that is really the most important consideration. And so as an example of that, last year we diagnosed that there was a high likelihood that wireless USB was going to be important, and yes, indeed, I think it's starting to now really appear and the interest is growing, and we're employees with both the digital analog side with a high quality solution. So that's how we go about it. So absolutely portfolio approach. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "But can you give me some more insight into how do you think about HDMI, because it's so widely adopted and it's pretty much of that in any consumer applications. So, is that something you think you will enter soon? Any color you can provide, that would be helpful? ", "Aart de Geus", "This is one of those situations where I wish you ask me a question on synthesis because I'm a lot more confident on that than our IP direction. For more detailed questions on some of those IP maybe we can connect you with the people working on it. I don't think that we have any announcements on HDMI at this point in time, but I concur with you that the whole, the whole video area is of very high interest going forward. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "So, let me ask, give it a try on the synthesis side. Not a technical question. Just, how are you using your market share in synthesis to win verification market? Is that something, are you able to put some hooks into your synthesis platform, that enables your verification platform, or that motivates the customer to choose your verification platform as opposed to your competitions platform? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, let me give you a good example. We have been certainly one of the key leaders in bringing about System Verilog on the market. And we have to realize more and more that, as much as one can have a great solution around the language or so, unless one has a complete solution, the customers really even more stock, like introducing a great new car and the only thing that is still missing are the tires. You still have nothing to drive in. And this is true throughout EDA, meaning that, if you want to drive a leading solution, you need to be able to go through all of the tools. And so System Verilog was a good example where the initial need came absolutely from the verification side. But customers were somewhat reluctant until it was also really good synthesis, really good form of verification for it, et cetera. Of course we have that today. And I think that is a good example where the sideway leverage is very much by providing a really reliable and complete solution. Power is a good other example of that. The unified power format is now well entrenched, and these are the type of thing that really bring all the tools together, in many cases also from multiple vendors. And we certainly are very much driving open standards around these things. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have a follow-up from the line of Terence Whalen of Citigroup. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Thanks, I have two quick product related questions. The first, there's a competitive offering to PrimeTime out in the market now, and was wondering if you had seen that at all competitively, and if you would like to comment on what you're seeing there? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well there have always been many timing verifiers, and many different tools use different things. At the same time, at the end of the day, there's a gold standard against which you make sure that your chip actually will work. And so, in technology just as in everything else, it's all about trust, and so PrimeTime is clearly the tool that is trusted to verify the timing of the chips. And by the way, PrimeTime itself is evolving continually at a very, very rapid pace, where today already we have variation aware capabilities in it, for example. So, from that perspective, I don't think things have changed much in the last decade. There will continually be other products seeking to do the same, and our objective and job is to make sure that we have the best product. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Great. And then a quick follow-up, Aart, to your comment on the common power format. I think a competitor of yours surprised people by rather quickly integrating their CPS into their digital design, is common power format actually integrated into your digital tools now, and what's a timeline that we can expect for that? ", "Aart de Geus", "We're actually talking about unified power formats, and there are many tools that are being aligned on that including many tools outside of Synopsys. This is a much broader industry coalition that is working in that direction, which is necessary. Because one should not underestimate the amount of work that people have to do that put together libraries, for example. And one should not underestimate the necessity to have a vary degree of accuracy and be able to measure things. So from that perspective, the success of all of these things, and this is not any different than library formats many years ago or language standards, such as system analog, they are often predicated on the success of many people to work really well together. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. Speakers, I'll turn it back to you. ", "Aart de Geus", "In that case, we appreciate your time spent with us. We think that we just concluded a very strong quarter and that we are well set for this year. As usual, Brian and team are available for questions after the earnings call. And we hope you have a good rest of the day, bye-bye. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

Davidson & Company ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Synopsys Incorporated Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter Of Fiscal Year 2007. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions). ", "As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Pamela. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys and Brian Beattie Chief Financial Officer. ", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may make forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for our first fiscal quarter, and in our earnings release for the second quarter. ", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. ", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that Synopsys had another very strong quarter, which further solidifies our outlook for the fiscal year. We continued our excellent business execution with strong revenue and earnings growth, solid cash flow, and our very predictable business model. ", "In technology, we see momentum. With new product introductions and customer adopting our complete platforms. We also continue to evolve our go-to-market approach for value capture and simultaneously invest in future growth. ", "Let me begin with some financial highlights. In Q2, we delivered excellent earnings growth. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share, more than double the same period last year. As a result, we are raising our earnings guidance for the year. Revenue in the quarter grew 7% year-over-year to $293 million. We managed costs well. Non-GAAP expenses were $229 million. ", "Our plan is to take a portion of these savings and invest in growth initiatives while holding total expenses for the year to a slight increase as we had planned. With our revenue and expense performance, we met our 2007 operating margin target ahead of schedule. It was 22% in Q2. We anticipate the full year operating margin to be approximately 20% as we drive towards our mid to high 20s target over the coming years. ", "Before delving into technology highlights, let me comment on the overall semiconductor landscape. Interacting with our customers we see a broad spectrum of challenges and expectations. Whereas some companies are doing very well, with solid results and expectations, others are reporting tappet results. While it's difficult predict short-term fluctuations, we are optimistic about the industry's long-term growth prospect. ", "Technology drivers, such as, VoIP, Internet video and consumer electronics in general, all provide a solid basis for sustained growth in semiconductors. Our view is supported by continued growth in advance design starts, driven by the demand for complex multi-faceted consumer devices. In fact, in the last six months, the active 65-nanometer designs we track have increased more than 50% to 441. ", "Even at 45-nanometer, we already track more than 50 designs and 9 tape-outs, virtually all relying heavily on Synopsys. The migration to 65 and 45 nanometer is visible, not only in logic SoC design, but in the memory sector, as well. ", "At the same time, customer budget pressures are intense. Technology development and capacity costs are making customers rethink how they differentiate. Recent announcements show a shift by some IDMs to a fab-lite business model. Some are also forming manufacturing consortium as a way to share costs. ", "Synopsys is well positioned to help customer meet their new requirements. During Q2, we saw a number of companies increase their commitment to Synopsys. In fact, we expect business for the year to be stronger than our initial plan. ", "STMicroelectronics, who present a great example of how we help customers, solved the competing challenges of extremely demanding technology with the need to minimize the cost of high volume. In fact, ST achieved first silicon success for a complex 65-nanometer consumer chip by using Synopsys throughout the entire flow, from IP, to implementation, to verification and final signoff. ", "Complex chips especially benefit from using our complete flow. Only powerful integrated platforms can truly tackle the maze of interrelated design objectives. Our investments in these kinds of platforms over the last few years are paying off. ", "This brings me to the product highlights for the quarter. Let me begin with our Galaxy implementation platform. Galaxy integrates the industry's de-facto standards in both synthesis and sign-off with state of the art physical design. ", "In synthesis where we have a clear market lead, our new topographical technology is having major impact. It has an uncanny ability to accurately predict and avoid downstream place and route issues. This capability, which I like to refer to as Clairvoyant synthesis, substantially reduces costly physical iterations. ", "Design Compiler topographical is not only consistently winning benchmarks, but customers, such as Hisilicon and Cypress Semiconductor are seeing great improvement in correlation and performance. ", "STMicroelectronics is adopting DC topographical in their 90 and 65 nanometer ASIC design flow for both internal design groups and external customers. ", "In physical design, IC Compiler is performing well. Our upgrade ramp is right on track, with more than 100 engagements, and many tape-outs and active designs all the way down to 45-nanometer. As an example, after carefully evaluating all options Renesas chose IC compiler for their production IC design flow. Our product had better quality results through multi-mode optimization, much faster turnaround time, and overall ease of use. ", "In sign-off, we continue to enhance our gold standard technology by integrating features, such as, low power and variation aware design. Fujitsu standardized on PrimeTime and Star-RCXT as their sign-off solution for their 65-nanometer design flows. ", "Meanwhile, Synopsys is the leader in advanced low power designs. Thanks to a comprehensive end-to-end solution that optimizes for powering every phase of the design flow. In Q2, Synopsys and ARM announced an IT compiler base joint flow for high performance low power applications on advance design. ", "Another key challenge at the most advanced technology nodes is yield. The latest consumer products are all built on the latest technology nodes. Companies are forced to quickly ramp production of hundreds of thousands or even millions of devices to satisfy channel demands. ", "Fortunately, we anticipated this a number of years ago, and began to assemble key technologies in both the design and the manufacturing domains. We have integrated the two domains to enhance yield at 65-nanometer and especially at 45-nanometer and below. ", "Today, our design for manufacturing strategy is bearing fruit with DFM revenue growing in the double digits. Our first integrated product was PrimeYield, which links data directly from the fab into the designs. ", "During Q2, we announced several technology advances; ease of use and performance enhancements to PrimeYield, a single user interface for physical verification PrimeYield, Mask Synthesis and TCAD, and we linked our Proteus lithography technology with our mask data prep. This linkage reduces run time by 20-30%. ", "During the quarter, we also announced the availability of an advanced Hercules physical verification suite. This suite supports the latest release of 65-nanometer design kits from IBM. ", "Now to discovery, our verification platform, which is also doing very well. A number of years ago, we made four predictions; one, verification needs would grow faster than Moore's Law; two, next generation verification and debugging had to be broader, more integrated and faster; three, support for the System Verilog language would be key; and four, smaller geometries would bring a greater need for analog and analog/mixed-signal verification. ", "We systematically developed our technology around these predictions. Our recent business successes with double digit growth are evidence of our vision and our momentum. In digital, the rapid migration to System Verilog supported by the raw speed advantage of our verification solution accentuates our differentiation. ", "Today, Synopsys is by far the leader in System Verilog Solutions. In analog/mixed-signal, we've had great technical end market progress, as well. In Q2, we introduced AMS 2007, which allows users to easily balance accuracy and performance. Past solutions were either more accurate, such as, HSPICE or faster, such as, NanoSim and HSIM. With our new technology, customers can have both. In addition, with AMS 2007, we improved the links between our analog and VCS based digital verification. ", "Moving now up to systems and IP. We've had good momentum as well. This adjacency is growing at about 20%. We're both participating in and benefiting from a rapidly evolving IP industry, as more and more large customers are outsourcing their IP needs. ", "Internally developed IP, unless it is highly differentiated, is no longer economically viable. Instead, companies, such as, Synopsys become the partners of choice, especially in standard space IP. The keys to the IP business are reused competence, quality, and long-term trust in the supplier. We do well on all three count and have spent years developing a strong portfolio. Today, we are one of the top IP companies in the world and number one in the connectivity IP with standards such as USB and PCI Express. ", "Over the past several quarters, our analog connectivity IP has been especially successful. In fact, we were recognized this quarter by Analog Zone, a premier source of information for design engineers as having \"The Best Connectivity IP.\" We received this recognition for our analog mixed signal IP course for the PCI Express, SATA and XAUI standards. ", "Against this backdrop of excellent financial results and technology momentum, we are tuning our go-to-market approach to capture more value for what we provide. That includes expanding our products and focus to better address new markets, such as, mature technology nodes of 130-nanometer and above. Connecting better to customers by segmenting their needs, and offering them solutions optimized for those needs, and improving our communication of the value we deliver to customers. ", "As part of our strategy, we just introduced a new product. IC Compiler Express targeted to the more mature technology nodes. We have long been viewed as the leader for the most complex designs. We believe this new target will expand our addressable market. IC Compiler Express is currently in limited availability, and we already have our first customers. ", "In addition, we are refining our sales approach to demonstrate the value of our complete platforms, and get fair compensation for the critical role we play in getting chips to market on spec and on time. ", "To wrap up, all around us we see encouraging indicators of momentum. Synopsys won the prestigious IBM Beacon Award for \"its complete EDA solution that supports and complements our advanced process technologies, and enables our clients to meet their manufacturing needs.\" It was the first Beacon Award ever for the IBM Samsung chartered Common Platform ecosystem. ", "In the first half of the year, we are seeing record attendance at our User Group Meetings across the globe. In fact, we have to move our San Jose venue to accommodate more than 1,500 engineers, a 20% increase over 2006. ", "Finally, our expertise in advanced designs and DFM is cementing Synopsys as the trusted advisor while semiconductor companies tackle the intricacies of migrating to 45 nanometer designs. ", "Summarizing Q2, it was all about strong execution. We delivered strong earnings growth and cash flow, and we are moving into the second half of the year with greater confidence in executing our plans and commitments. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, who will provide more detail on the financials. ", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you Aart. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. ", "Q2 was another quarter of solid execution for Synopsys with strong revenue, earnings and cash flow. More than two years ago, we committed to improving our operating margin to greater than 20% during fiscal 2007. ", "In Q2, we've reached that goal ahead of schedule, achieving 22% operating margin, a sequential increase of more than 400 basis points. While some of these increases are due to timing of expenses, I'm nonetheless extremely pleased with our expense discipline and our ability to meet this operating margin objective early. ", "Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials. As a reminder, our fiscal first quarter included an extra week that occurs every seven years; Q2 obviously did not include that extra week. ", "Total revenue was $293 million, up 7% year-over-year and down slightly compared to Q1 as expected due to that extra week last quarter. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our Q2 revenue. ", "GAAP earnings per share were $0.28 in Q2 with costs and expenses totaling $255.6 million. This included a $26.2 million amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation. Also included in our GAAP earnings is $12.5 million of other income related to the legal settlement with Magma. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.35 in Q2, above our target and more than double the same period last year. This overachievement is due to both the timing of expenses through the year and a very good expense and tax management. As a result, we are raising our annual earnings guidance. ", "Continuing with expenses, non-GAAP expenses were $228.6 million for the quarter, a sequential decrease of 7%. R&D was $85.3 million, sales and marketing $75 million and G&A came in at $20.3 million, all of which were down sequentially. This was mainly due to the extra fiscal week last quarter as well as normal quarterly expense fluctuations. ", "However, as Aart mentioned, we also had some expense savings in Q2, which we will be able to reinvest in targeted business initiatives while keeping our annual expense target unchanged at a very modest 2% to 3% growth. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin increased to 22% in Q2. ", "For the full year, we now expect our operating margin to be approximately 20%, an increase of about 600 basis points over last year. As expenses fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, we expect our operating margin to dip a little in Q3 and then increase again in Q4. ", "The non-GAAP tax rate was 24.1% in Q2, reflecting our restructuring of international operations and resulting in an improvement to our annual tax rate for FY '07. ", "Turning now to bookings, 93% of Q2 product orders were booked as time based licenses with only 7% upfront. We continue to have one of the most transparent and predictable business models in software. ", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments in Q2 was 2.6 years, which is within our historical range. Regionally, Asia Pacific had the strongest quarter, thanks to excellent execution from the team. ", "Turning now to cash. Cash and short-term investments increased $88 million sequentially to $768 million. Our operating cash flow was also $88 million in Q2, which includes $12.5 million related to the settlement with Magma. ", "In Q2, capital expenditures were $13 million and we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our stock for $63 million. As we announced during the quarter, our Board increased our buyback authorization to $500 million. ", "Our diluted share count increased slightly to 150 million shares due to a combination of higher stock price and the timing of share issuance and buybacks. Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $167 million and DSOs were 52 days, which is within our historical range. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $606 million. ", "At the end of Q2, we had approximately 5,100 employees, a slight drop sequentially and the third quarter in a row in a row we reduced our head count. On a year-over-year basis, our head count is flat, as we have offset acquisitions and growth in low-cost regions with reductions in some of the higher cost areas. ", "For the third quarter of FY '07 our targets are: revenue between $295 million and $305 million. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $268 million and $284 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $243 million and $253 million, an increase due to timing of expenses through the year. ", "Other income and expense between $3 million and $6 million, a non-GAAP tax rate between 26% and 27%, outstanding shares between 146 million and 151 million, GAAP earnings of $0.13 to $0.20 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.28 to$0.31 per share, and we expect more than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. ", "Now looking at the total year of 2007, we're raising the bottom end of our revenue range with our new target between $1.19 billion and $1.205 billion, non-GAAP expenses to be between 2% to 3% higher than FY '06, on a non-GAAP tax rate between 25% and 26%, an improvement of 6 to 7 points over last year. ", "Outstanding shares between 146 million and 151 million, GAAP earnings per share between $0.78 and $0.89, which includes the impact of approximately $69 million in stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.33. We've increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.04 and the top end by $0.02, and this of course is up from $0.77 in 2006. ", "Operating margin for the year of approximately 20% and over the next four quarters, we expect approximately $970 million of our beginning of quarter backlog to turn to revenue. We expect cash flow from operations to be greater than $275 million. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) First we'll go to the line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon. Good job on the quarter. Aart, first question for you. I know you started off by providing us with an update on 65 and 45 nanometer design starts. Still pretty strong, I think it was up about 18% sequentially for 65. Can you also give us the 65-nanometer tape-outs you tracked in Q2? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. 194 tape-outs for Q2. And yeah, I think it is up quite strongly. As a matter of fact, we of course have also the data for 90 nanometer. And it tracks; it's virtually identical to 90-nanometer delayed by eight quarters. And 45 is identical again delayed by eight quarters. So far the advance nodes are moving along just fine. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And the environment for your customers as you mentioned in your opening remarks as well, continues to be mixed and in some cases fairly challenging. So is the team seeing any signs of softness out there within your customer base as it relates to tool spend? ", "Aart de Geus", "I don't think so. I think that people are cautious because it's a turbulent sea. At the same time, its a little bit winners\u2019 take-all type of market where you have to bet otherwise you can't play. And so the advance designs demands a lot of tools, a lot of technology, and that's of course where we are primarily in and advance designs by definition is part of the winners' crew. ", "In general, though, I think we'll see some up and downs for some of the customers. And we will be careful to invest especially in those people that we see as winners. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. And on the Galaxy platform, there's been, recently there have been a few very high visibility bake-offs or evals for physical implementation at 65 or below. And I think Synopsys and competitors are right now involved in a pretty big bake-off as one of the biggest founders of semi companies in the world. So question for you, Aart, is how has IC Compiler faired in some of these recent evals? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, IC Compiler is doing great right now. I'm not sure which eval you're referring to, but in general we never comment on individual customers anyway. Their evals is sort of this continuing effort. And frankly there are a number of customers that sometime call an eval just finishing their chip. And more often than not, we've seen that somebody has had challenges in getting closure with a competitor and then under the guidance of an eval, they ask us. Hey. So what can you do? ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Right. ", "Aart de Geus", "We partially like those, partially feel that it's a little bit overusing our good will. But what is always clear though, is that the most difficult chips we can finish and we are finishing many, especially the ones where there is a combination of timing challenges and low power. And that's absolutely where our strength is. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. And quick question for you, Brian; nice job on the team for controlling expenses in Q2, but for Q3, the expenses are growing at twice the rate versus revenues. Then it does look like op margins will probably drop below 20% as you said. So maybe a little bit more color from the team in terms of, I think you mentioned investments in growth initiatives. What sort of programs are we talking about here? ", "Brian Beattie", "Well, I put all of that in context of good expense management through the quarter. And leading into Q3 and the rest of the year, our total year guidance as we said is with revenues growing in the range of 8.5% to 10%. We committed pretty early on to limiting the growth for all of '07 to 2% to 3%. And in fact, to highlight that point, 2% of that is due to the extra week we have in 2007, compared to last year. ", "So you've got to look at us holding expenses flat for the year while driving up the revenue growth of 8% to 10%. You're going to get some fluctuations from one quarter to the next, just based on timing of expenses, how they come through and their profile for the quarter. So I'd really kind of focus on the trends and the expense management to show our continued focus on the op margin improvements. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And just any color on growth initiatives maybe from either you or Aart? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well the growth initiatives are, well, I think the main focus for is clearly been that putting together tools in more coherent flows and platforms is absolutely starting to pay off. And so as we can illustrate to customers that by using a more complete solution from Synopsys, they cannot only significantly reduce their time to market risk, but in many situations get better results. That is a great way of moving us forward from a business perspective. ", "The other thing that we're doing in this tuning of our sales force to the market is to get a much better understanding of what are really the key concerns of the customers. And although very often they formulated as technical concerns, very, often it is business concerns and business direction. And that ties to my earlier comment of seeing fairly choppy waters in the semiconductor market. And the more we can be responsive to the needs of those customers as they decide where to go, the better. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Thank you Aart. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Aart, in your prepared remarks, you referred to a new analog mixed signal product, which I think you said combined sort of the best of HSPICE NanoSim, sort of the accuracy of HSPICE with the speed of. NanoSim. Can you go into a little more detail on that product? Is that a combination of these two products? Or is that a completely new product? ", "Aart de Geus", "Val it good its right you've highlighted. Because my comments were rather simplified compared to the technology on need base. What we're referring to here is what we call the XA option to a number of tools that allows them to dial up or down accuracy versus speed in a much more continuum fashion, between the HSPICE we won, which is very, very precise, to the NanoSim or HSIM, which is very, very fast. ", "And a number of customers have always had this wish of well, you know, I would be willing to give up a little bit on accuracy if I could just get a lot more speed. And being able to navigate that space in a continuous fashion is what this capability offers. And we have decided to offer it as an additional option to these existing products because that's the best way to get a quick return on the value that we provide. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "So, it is actually sort of both products essentially, and you have a way of sort of seamlessly switching between the two to trade off speed and accuracy? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah, it is more set of algorithm that have been implemented in those products and allow one of the products to take over a couple more capabilities of the another that\u2019s maybe the best way of thinking about it. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Understood. And Aart, you mentioned that IC Compiler was doing well and that Galaxy was, but that segment was only up about a 1% year-over-year it looks like, which is pretty modest growth relative to the rest of your business. ", "Should we expect that to, you know, I thought sort of once IC Compiler got sort of going on the upgrade cycle that we might see better growth out of that. Is this just sort of a lumpy quarter? And should we expect to see that growing at a higher rate for the balance of the year? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, two comments. First, you're correct about the quarter, although, if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's already pretty excess. And the other thing is if you look core EDA, which actually combines with the verification, it's about 9.5 or so percent. So the reason I'm saying that is because very often in the larger deals, the products tradeoff within a pool of technology. ", "And at times that makes our own general managers unhappy because who deserves the credit and it's not always completely to reveal to allocate in those polls. However, all in all, IC Compiler's are actually doing very well. And we also see that by the rate of adoption in production and the still very high degree of support. I think most of our physical support has now entirely switched from DC Ultra to IC Compiler. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Is the modest revenue growth to do with pricing? Is the pricing continuing to be quite aggressive in the digital implementation area? ", "Aart de Geus", "I think that pricing in any form of large deals will absolutely stay aggressive. That is precisely one of the reasons, of course, why we're investing in adjacency that leverage off of the core EDA. Although core EDA this year is doing better than it was in the last few years and largely due to the fact of having both technology, strength and implementation, IC Compiler but also synthesis and Synopsys and a very strong verification offering. ", "So I think that's the way to look at it is that core EDA tends to be more linked to the existing budgets of the customer migrating gradually whereas all of the adjacencies are our opportunity to sell on top of those budgets. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Okay. Just one final one, if I could. You guys nicely provide this metric of bookings turning to revenue over the next 12 months and that had been sort of going up for several quarters and it sort of flattened and actually ticked down for this quarter. Is there anything to read into that metric? ", "Aart de Geus", "No. As a matter of fact, the thing to understand is that as we are completely or right at the end of our move to a ratable model, you sort of get the gradual balance between the two. And secondly, I think we'll see reasonably large fluctuations quarter-to-quarter just as a function of what\u2019s the, deals are that come in the second quarter. ", "Let's assume you have some very large deal. Well for the next six to eight to ten quarters after that by definition, the bookings ratio will be down. And that is just fine as long as we our run rate with these accounts. And that is really the thing that we\u2019re focusing on. And I'm absolutely on the side that one should not pay too much attention to the bookings number, much more to how we grow the revenue over time. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Fair enough. Thank you very much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Hi, thank you. I just had one quick one. Brian, you've got just under 800 million in cash. You talked about buyback being refilled this last quarter. I'm curious when you think about this business, how much cash do you need to run the business? And if you might think about, it certainly seems like have the opportunity to more aggressively buyback and still leave plenty of cash on the balance sheet given the cash generation characteristics here. How do you think about that? Cadence is obviously is a little bit more levered up? Is that something you would consider? How does the thought process work? ", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah, I think, we're in really good shape in terms of the cash flow. It's just a critical asset to the company and getting close to 800 million it\u2019s an excellent credit to all of the hard work we put into it. ", "We're always looking at the capital structure to determine how we can best use the cash, which of course includes M&A activities, the buyback levels, which we recently increased to bring that back up to $500 million. So, it shows that we plan to be aggressive and I think the Q2 activity also reflects that we were aggressive in the second quarter spending that amount back buying back our stock. ", "Another part is again looking at funding the ongoing operations. Also you look at where the cash is, how much is in the U.S. and how much is internationally and balance that to the overall use of those same things. Is M&A going to be local? Is it going to be offshore? And how do we leverage up the cash assets? ", "So continue to look at all those, so we have been aggressive, we continue to be one of the largest in the industry in terms of using our cash flow to acquire our stock back. And of course all the operations focuses on continuing to drive good strong cash inflow to the company. We're holding our commitment at bringing in more than 275 million of cash this year. So it's really a good focus and continues to buy those assets. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "So, Brian, do you think you need this level of cash, obviously you're spending a lot of what you generate, but this level of cash would seem to be even despite the commentary on potential M&A etcetera, would seem to be in excess of what you need to run this business. Do you disagree? ", "Brian Beattie", "Well, I'd say it's a real strong position. It's way more than the minimum amount of cash you need to just get by. But again having that flexibility to invest in M&A in the right opportunities new growth initiatives inside the company, I think are an excellent asset for the to give you that level of flexibility and timing to invest when you need to. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Any update on the pending IRS dispute? You're not holding cash for that potential outcome are you? And when would you expect a resolution? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, we're have had, again, as you know this takes quite a while getting addressed, but we have had some movement over this past quarter and that the appeals process began in April. And we don't believe there'll be a settlement of that during FY07, but in our initial meetings, I think both sides feel good about moving fairly quickly to a positive conclusion for everybody. So again, the cash is not related to the tax issue, we believe we're adequately provided for on that basis in any case. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Brian Beattie", "Okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Aart, I'd like to follow-up on an initiative you mentioned at the analyst meeting in which you did again today. Let's call it run rate compiler. And could you be a little more specific as to the early results you're seeing as to the focus on run rate? And the ways you're going to be able to substantiate that is in fact occurring that you're growing the business organically as you're aiming to do? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, there's only one substantiation, which is called the revenue and our job is to keep growing revenue. Actually, I would argue our job is more importantly to keep growing earnings. And so obviously the earnings can grow by both growing the revenue or improving the ops margin. Right now we're doing both. ", "I think the fact that we are a bit ahead on our ops margin is very positive, because it allows us to put some of that into the earnings, some into investments for future growth. Having said that, when you have a ratable business model, it's fairly complex to compute how the deals impact the long-term outlook, but I think we're well on top of that. ", "And quarter-by-quarter we're absolutely tracking how we are growing the run rate with individual accounts where transactions are done. And by the way, our sales this year more compensated for that than they were in previous years. And so, all of these things are heading in the right direction. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Given the comment you just made about ops margins being at least as important as revenue growth. And when you tie that into the concept of run rate, is the profitability by customer at all a meaningful or a measurable part of the business? ", "Aart de Geus", "I think that's an excellent question, because I think it is meaningful, it is partially measurable, and it is an opportunity for us over time to improve our operations. I don't want to give the impression that today that is something that is managed very, very precisely. ", "However, I think we are increasingly aware that, if we could improve the profitability by customer that that is yet another opportunity to improve our overall business operating model or to achieve other things with customers. And so, I think it's a good question for which I hope that in the next few quarters I'll have a gradually better and better answer because we're definitely looking at that. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Brian, you mentioned the duration was only 2.6 years. And you're right, that is within the range we've seen, but it is nevertheless the lowest in three years. Was there something anomalous in the quarter that resulted in it being at least somewhat lower than we've seen in the last 10-12 quarters? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, Jay, I wouldn't read anything into any of the trends. It does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. In particular this quarter, we had a couple of our deals had a shorter term to them than some of the other quarters than we've had. So it came in at 2.6 and anticipate for the rest of the year it gets up again. It was just based on the mix of the actual orders closed in the quarter. So ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. ", "Brian Beattie", "I wouldn't read anything else into it. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Lastly, Aart, you highlighted consumer electronics a number of times. Could you talk about what your positioning is for other important or incrementally important verticals? Wireless, of course it could ties into your AMS comments. But automotive, imaging, other sorts of technology sectors where the electronics demand seem to be accelerating, as well? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, sure it's interesting you mention wireless, because some people would now readily put wireless in the consumer segment, right, given that how powerful the cell phone is and how much the cell phone is becoming sort of the ultimate communication, play machine and everything. ", "At the same time, it is clear that in a number of other segments we are doing well, memory would be a good other example that in the past we didn't pay as much attention to, automotive has been an okay segment for us. It is not our primary focus because it tends to be very analog mixed signal centric, where we have strong simulation and some very good system tools. But it's not our center of gravity. ", "The type of segmentation that we prefer is segmentation that goes by very fundamental need. And the fundamental needs tend to be, needs such as very high volume, therefore, you need to make sure that the yield is there and that the chip has been absolutely minimized in area, typically there was very high volume tend to be also very advanced, and functionality, therefore, there's a lot of verification that\u2019s there. And so our value formulation is very much in solving a set of five or six macro problems and trying to be at best there and then transcends a different traditional vertical. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Aart. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Thanks for taking my question. This question is for Brian. Brian, you mentioned that there were some quarter-to-quarter changes in expense timing? And `was hoping to get a little bit more color on that. ", "And then in addition, was hoping to get a little bit of a longer-term view of the opportunity for expense saving. What inning are we in, in terms of keeping expenses at only one or two points growth? Could that actually be sustained for one to two years to come? ", "Brian Beattie", "Good question, yeah, Terence. We're looking again really clearly at each one of our line of expenses. Both going from the first quarter to the second quarter and very significant drop that we're able to put in place and the actions in the quarter continue to be under spending relative to our plans keeping the headcount and having it come down slightly in the quarter. All of this again is focused on margins and earnings improvement as we go forward. ", "So while we're again proud of achieving a target we set some two years ago and increasing our margin numbers for '07 by 600 basis points, we're not stopping there. And you heard Aart say that committed to continue to drive to mid to high 20s in margin. So clearly that requires spending the growth significantly less than revenue growth. So, we're focused on that element and optimizing the resources we do have in various areas. ", "So, again, as you look at the drops from Q2 to Q1, primarily they're due to the extra week we also had a gain on some sale of some land, which is a few million dollars in the second quarter. And then as you look forward to Q3 and Q4, again, keeping that expense commitment in place at the 2% to 3% is what we're committed to doing. And again this is also to highlight a point that our business is stronger in 2007 than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. ", "So again the expense that there is higher business being completed we've also have an expense accruals to put in place for that as we go through the year plus the full-year impacts of acquisitions, foreign exchange costs, and other things, all that saying still flat year-over-year in 2007. So, again, attributed to the team for a lot of hard work in making that come through. And the trends going forward in '08 and beyond are focused on continuing to improve operating margins. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Great. And then a follow-up if I could for Aart. Aart, you mentioned IC Compiler express initial reception has been quite positive. Can you also kind of expand on whether segmentation is just for digital design? Or is that an area that could also or strategy rather that could be proliferated on into have verification, as well? Thank you. ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, let me start right away with the second one, which is verification, absolutely can be stratified into different segments. And we see today that there are very different behaviors in different customer categories. ", "If you take, for example, the processor, the VSP, the graphics guys, they use an immense amount of verification, largely because their products are very complex, are going in broad distribution and are expected to be flawless. ", "At the same time, you look at people that are let's say in the wireless communication segment, their verification is growing rapidly, but I think there's a long way to go before they can assure the same degree of coverage of the first group that I mentioned. If you then look at the segment I mentioned earlier, which is memory, you see that there again there's a big change because traditionally memory has been very level verification. ", "And now the complexity of the memories is bringing about a surrounding of digital control that is great for us because not only are we very, very strong in digital, but we're also very strong in analog mix signal, meaning that the combination of digital and analog. And so each of one of those sort of talks their own language when they talk about verification. And the same is true for the vast majority of our products. I think the forays into the less advanced technologies, forays may not be the right term, spending a little bit more attention is primarily a broadening of our potential addressable market that in the past we just didn't pay all that much attention to. ", "And so we may, as well, leveraged all the technology that we've built by making it easier to use somewhat simplified and the right cost point for people that are maybe less demanding. ", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of Dennis Wassung with Canaccord Adam. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adam", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess first a quick follow-up on the operating expenses. I know you had a couple of questions on this. But, you talked about the new initiatives, released more cost are coming back into the model here. And I was just curious; I think this was asked, I didn't really catch an answer. ", "Do you expect to see a lot of that I guess resurgence and expense coming on the R&D line? Just a new product development efforts or specific R&D efforts or is there a sales and marketing push expansion in specific areas that we should look for, as well? Just trying to understand the dynamic there. ", "Brian Beattie", "Okay. Well, Aart, maybe over\u2026 ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, let me start in general. Just to be crystal clear, we have committed a number of years ago to keep improving the ops margin. We are continuing to do that. At the same time, we gave our self a timetable that I think we have rigorously met, and we are exceeding now. The way we're looking at that is to say, hey, there's opportunities to invest some of that in future growth. And simultaneously stay ahead of schedule. ", "And so I think that's good news in both, what goes to the bottom line as well as what we can invest for the future. ", "Now, when we look at our investment, it's absolutely clear that fundamentally have two groups that you want to invest in either R&D development or new things or fields. It's typically not the third one, which is infrastructure that you want to keep either flat or optimize more on. And so there the decision has to be whatever gives us the best chance of growing our footprint and our success rate with the customers. ", "And in some cases, it's clearly an R&D because it's infinite new projects possible there. But in some cases it is also go for a different approach with the customer, take over more of some of the things they do and evolve our overall solution with them. And so we have now have the luxury to look a bit at both of those things. And we'll decide on ROI evaluation basis. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adam", "Okay. That helps, thank you. And secondly, the DFM and yield side of the equation, you made some comments about some of your products becoming more of a common interface. ", "I'm just wondering if you look at your DFM group in general, it had a nice steady growth past year, I'm wondering where the strength is, if there's a specific area or is it strong across the Board? Is OPC a big driver for that? Is PrimeYield taking a bigger piece of this pie. Could you just maybe talk about what's driving that growth at this point? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, fundamentally if you look at DFM, obviously it means different things, different people because they are at both the D wares and the M wares, right. And so let me start actually with the M side which is if you look at T cap, that is obviously deep inside of the manufacturing chain, be and so focused on either process development or device development or manufacturing optimization. ", "And so those are sort of the key areas to focus on. Then the second grouping is everything that has to do with masks. And there we have the various forms of radical enhancement technologies and of fracturing and a variety of verification things. ", "The third one has to do with the whole yield measure test chip etcetera area. And the fourth one, which is where really the design word comes back in, is how do you close the loop with all this information into design? And that's where PrimeYield over the years will hopefully become what PrimeTime is today in timing. ", "And a number of years ago, we obviously pioneered the ability to predict timing in such a fashion that you could rely on it and design towards it. We are heading in the same direction towards predicting yield and designing towards it. And so those are the centers of gravity and then from quarter-to-quarter, there's big fluctuations as to which one happens to have big deals. But it is really the aggregate picture that we're after. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adam", "As you look at your total suite of offerings in this area, do you feel like you have the complete picture at this point? Or is there a specific technology that you're missing? Or can I get the feel that you have an accurate and adequate offering at this point for 65 and 45 nanometers and below? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we know that we have an adequate offerings for 65 and 45, because we have a number of customers that do their entire flow with us and are doing very well with this. On the other hand, whenever you talk about emerging technologies the word complete has never applied in the 20 years that we've had Synopsys. So there's always new investments and new opportunities, although I must say I think that EDA is in a very different phase in that we have much more complete solutions today and whenever possible we like to amend them ourselves or then acquire technology that fits in, but all in all, I think we are as complete as anybody on the market today. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adam", "Thank you. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We are now five minutes prior to the conclusion of our conference. So we'll take our final question from the line of Matt Petkun with D.A. Davidson & Company ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to follow-up on Dennis's question. To be a little bit more specific. So when we look to sequential changes and expenses from Q2 to Q3, you're talking about investing in R&D. Should it be the R&D line item on a non-GAAP basis that grows more rapidly sequentially than the SG&A line item? ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think, don't overemphasize too much these changes from quarter-to-quarter. I'm sure Brian will give you a more refined answer here. But from my perspective, the only numbers that really matter is sort of the rolling 12-month averages because from one quarter to another, the way some of these things fall in one quarter or another can change radically the actual distribution. ", "Now having said that, clearly if we make additional investments, they tend to be in the R&D and potentially in some aspects of the field rather than anywhere else in the company. And we're very careful with making these additional commitments to be much sharper about what's the reach on an investment on each one of those. You want to add anything, Brian? ", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, I'd say as you look specific on the line-by-line basis that from Q2 to Q3 we'll see an increase recognizing a several million dollar gain on sale of that land that was in the G&A area. So that will be an increase from Q2 to Q3 on G&A. ", "From sales and marketing perspective, again, as the business continues to grow, there'll be expenses there associated with higher commission activity and higher business and that continues to go up as the business grows. But again, all in all, keeping in line with that 2% to 3% growth for the year and then the R&D as Aart said is really focused specifically on getting more development, more capacity and capability while driving efficiency through the team and obviously leveraging lower cost areas to the extent we can. And so again, that's the message on each one of the lines for the operating expense. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then Aart, I was hoping you could give us a bit of an update on what you are seeing in the world of system level design and ESL specifically kind of noting the fact that about a year ago that you acquired Video to do some more kind of embedded software platform development debugging. ", "So I am wondering kind of what's going on there? Has that market really developed and what do you expect from it going forward? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, we are engaged quite a number of places with Virtio and I think that's a direct reflection of the fact that increasingly people developing software would like to have some degree of modeling of the hardware before the hardware is fully developed or even built. ", "And so the level of interest is high and the number of engagements is high. I think it will take a little bit of time for the market to develop. But there's one other angle that one should not forget, which is the whole angle of IP as actually in my opinion the much more important ESL success factor today. ", "Because a lot of people have thought about ESL why don't you just create designs from a higher level? Well, the way you create designs from a higher level is start with much higher-level building blocks. ", "And we are absolutely seeing that that vision is materializing more and more literally quarter-by-quarter because in the whole wave of companies looking at their cost structure and by the way quite a number doing that by virtue of being investigated by private equity opportunities. ", "They are all coming to the conclusion that a lot of these design activities on the individual blocks have completely no return on investment for them and are not differentiated. And for those companies being able to come to us and say can you develop the basic building blocks and provide them to us is a very promising approach for them to save money and of course for us to grow our business. ", "And now tying this back to virtue, the reason I am enthusiastic about that is because I think that the content of software in these building blocks is growing and by the way also the verification aspect of these building blocks because verification is by far the largest consumer of EDA software period. ", "And so I think there are great opportunities as these things come together. And so that's the vision we're pursuing. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. Thanks so much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. Well with that that concludes our earnings release, we really appreciate the time you spent with us. We think that we're coming off a very strong quarter and definitely feel momentum in both the technology direction and the business direction. ", "And so from that perspective feel that the year is in very good shape. If you have further comments or questions, as usual Brian, Lisa, and I will be available after the call. Thank you very much for spending an hour with us. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

(NASDAQ:SNPS)   F3Q07 Earnings Call  August 22, 2007  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Lisa Ewbank - Vice President, Investor Relations ", " Aart J. de Geus - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer ", " Brian M. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer ", "Analysts", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley ", " Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", " Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup ", " Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets ", " Richard Valera - Needham & Company ", " Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Synopsys earnings conference call for the third quarter fiscal year 2007. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may make forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company\u2019s actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006, our recent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and in our earnings release for the third quarter. ", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in our third quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to report that Synopsys again produced a very strong quarter. Excellent business execution brought us strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as solid cash flow. Our robust technology was rewarded by increased customer momentum and our focus on marketing strategy is making visible progress. ", "Let me begin with the main financial highlights. In Q3, we delivered excellent earnings growth with non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, a 50% increase over the same period last year. Revenue in the quarter grew 10% year over year to $304 million. From an orders perspective, we had by far the largest quarter ever with a book-to-bill of well over 2. ", "We managed costs well. Non-GAAP expenses were within our expected range of $247 million. For the year, we are well on track to deliver on our operating margin objective of 20%. Going forward, we remain committed to a target in the mid to high 20s over the coming years. ", "Let me now briefly comment on the overall semiconductor landscape. In Q3, the environment did not change significantly from the previous period. Memory pricing is clearly strained, although overall semiconductor demand continues to grow unabated. ", "A number of companies are reassessing their manufacturing options, including the possibility of sharing capacity and technology developments. The move to smaller geometries meanwhile is not slowing down. In fact, one of our customers has already announced a 45-nanometer consumer chip that has moved from design to production shipments. ", "Needless to say, the technical challenges of 65 and 45-nanometer design are substantial. There are hundreds of millions of transistors, laying out the physical design for optimal timing and low power, minimizing the physical effects on yield, all under severe schedule constraints on an [upward] path. ", "However, these challenges play to Synopsys' strength of advanced technology, complete solution, and sophisticated support. As a result, during Q3 we moved several important long-term relationships to the next level of collaboration. The most visible of these is with Intel. After a substantial set of evaluations, Intel selected Synopsys as its primary EDA supplier. ", "This comprehensive agreement expands our relationships, not just in terms of commercial duration, run-rate and product utilization, but also in terms of wide-reaching technical collaboration with what is arguably the most advanced semiconductor technology company in the world. ", "It is important to note that our business was strong this quarter, even excluding Intel. A number of other leading companies, including some we have worked closely with for years, are expanding their relationships with us to redefine the technology landscape and sharpen their differentiation. ", "One example is a broad agreement with a semiconductor ecosystem leader, which features both a larger commercial relationship and a collaboration to bring advanced solutions to our mutual customers. ", "This brings me to some product highlights for the quarter. Over the years, we have pulled together an increasingly integrated and broad complement of capabilities. Today, I would like to highlight one area where Synopsys is differentiated with a complete end-to-end solution -- low power. ", "At 65-nanometer and below, piecemeal solutions offered by many vendors just don\u2019t work. Synopsys\u2019 integrated offerings let customers achieve low power goals while also meeting their other objectives on schedule. ", "As one example, when ARM, the world\u2019s largest semiconductor IP company, required a low power methodology for their CPU cores, they partnered with Synopsys. We jointly developed a low power methodology that was delivered to the design community at June\u2019s design automation conference. Demand was so high that the publisher cut its release timeline in half and was actually selling preliminary copies. ", "Our low power expertise permeates both our Galaxy implementation and discovery verification platforms. While Synopsys\u2019 synthesis has had embedded power optimization for well over a decade, more recently our IC Compiler has integrated the most advanced low power layout techniques with great success. ", "For example, IC Compiler helped NEC achieve 2X performance improvement and still meet a very tough power budget. Toshiba is standardizing on IC Compiler for its highly automated, multi-voltage, tightly integrated flow. Just to expand on IC Compiler for a moment, we have moved beyond the initial deployment phase well into proliferation. On both a business and technology basis, it is doing very well. ", "On the verification side, we continued our low power focus with the June acquisition of ArchPro, the industry leader in multi-voltage design verification and sign-off. With ArchPro, we are adding unique low-power differentiation to discovery. ", "Companies such as Renesas, for example, are already using this sophisticated technology in their most advanced multi-voltage designs. ", "The need for faster and faster verification continues with no end in sight. In both digital and analog mixed signal, Discovery is seeing great technical end-market success. ", "VCF is seeing important competitive wins and displacements and continues to grow very well. This momentum is driven by strong technology, leadership in SystemVerilog, and a complete, mature verification methodology that has been deployed worldwide, most recently in China. ", "In analog mixed signal, we also witnessed excellent technical end market progress. Specifically, the ability to trade up accuracy and performance in our AMS 2007 offering was especially well-received by our customers. ", "Now, to our design for manufacturing adjacency, which continues to show good results. This area has potential both for manufacturing and for the connection between design and manufacturing. The physics of ever-smaller geometry makes designing for acceptable yields an increasing challenge. Over the last five years, Synopsys has developed and acquired advanced technology in both design and manufacturing. ", "We have been integrating these two domains to enhance yield at 65-nanometer and especially at 45 and below. Our first integrated product was PrimeYield, which links manufacturing information into design. The result is an accurate simulation of complex lithography physical effects before the chips are actually built. ", "This integration brings customers potentially huge cost-savings by avoiding yield pitfalls. We are beginning to see PrimeYield momentum in both technology wins and adoption. In addition, it has already been qualified for TSMC\u2019s reference flow 8.0. ", "Looking forward, we are continuing to integrate more steps along the design for manufacturing continuum. For example, we are presently integrating our optical proximity correction and mass data prep solutions. Excellent advancements in our core OCP engine are also bringing us competitive success. ", "We had two significant wins in Q3 against both a traditional competitor whom we displaced and also a technology win versus a newcomer. ", "Now to IP, which had another very strong quarter and is our fastest-growing adjacency. Having heavily invested in the quality processes to create a core sophisticated IP, we are now enjoying the fruits of those efforts as IP proliferation becomes much more mainstream. ", "Today, Synopsys is the recognized leader in connectivity IP, with both analog and digital cores for standards like USB and PCI express. During the quarter, we expanded our IP portfolio by acquiring the assets of MOSAID, a leader in DDR cores. Increasing our reach into this key interface standard expands our ability to offer customers a one-stop shop for high quality IP. ", "Let me focus for a moment on our go-to-market strategy to capture more value for what we provide. I am happy to report that we made good progress this quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, in addition to serving customers with the most advanced, bleeding edge designs, we are focusing on better addressing the needs of customers who design at mature technology nodes of 130-nanometer and above. ", "Last quarter, we introduced our first new product, IC Compiler Express, targeted at these processes. This quarter, IC Compiler Express became generally available and already has several customers. ", "From the IP side, we are also broadening our offering beyond the most demanding users. In Q3, as part of our segmentation strategy, we introduced special edition design ware cores. These cores are preconfigured and pre-integrated IP for customers who need more mainstream solutions. They reduce the engineering efforts spent on integrating a digital and analog block together and reduce our support cost as well. ", "Going forward, we will apply the same product stratification to our verification offering. Today, we are viewed as the go-to company for the most advanced simulation and bug-finding needs and rightfully so. We plan to extend this expertise into the broader market as well. Stay tuned to this are in the quarters to come. ", "Before concluding, I would like to briefly address our outlook beyond 2007. With recent fluctuations in the financial markets, we appreciate that many of you are wondering about our 2008 outlook. We are completing our 2008 plans this quarter and will provide final guidance at our next earnings call. However, thanks to the visibility of our business model, we feel comfortable giving you some preliminary thoughts as an indication of confidence and strength going into the year. ", "Even with the end of our license model transition, and even without the extra week we had in 2007, we are comfortable with current Wall Street expectations of non-GAAP EPS growth of 16% to 19%, revenue growth of 7% to 8%, and assumptions of continued improvement in operating margin. ", "To wrap up, Q3 was all about excellent execution. We delivered strong earnings growth, record orders, solid cash flow, and we broadened some very important customer partnerships. We look forward to ending the year strongly and are well-positioned to continue to deliver good results into 2008. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Brian who will provide more detail on the financials. ", "Brian M. Beattie", "Thank you, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with an update on our stock repurchase program, and conclude with our guidance. As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and the financial supplement posted on our website. ", "In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise. ", "We are very pleased that we\u2019ve completed another strong quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in revenues and earnings per share and expanded our operating margins. We generated significant cash from operations, continued our stock repurchase program, and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy. ", "Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials. Total revenues increased 10% to $304.1 million, at the high-end of our target range. Business was robust across all the product lines and we continue to expect a book-to-bill greater than one for all of FY07. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of our Q3 revenues. ", "Turning to expenses, total non-GAAP expenses were within our planned range at $247.2 million for the quarter. As expected, operating expenses increased during the quarter due to timing of expenses, such as variable compensation, reflecting higher Q3 and annual business levels. ", "For the full year, we are maintaining our total annual expense target of a very modest 2% to 3% increase, inclusive of our extra week of spending this year. ", "We were pleased with our profitability during the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margins increased nearly 400 basis points to 18.7%, and as expected, dipped sequentially due to timing of expenses. ", "For the first three quarters of our fiscal year, we have achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 19.4%. We are committed to achieving an operating margin of approximately 20% for all of fiscal 2007, driving to the mid to high 20s in the next several years. We plan to achieve these targets by growing revenue and continually improving the company\u2019s operations and cost structure. ", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.17, with cost and expenses totaling $281.1 million. This includes $12.2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16.1 million of share-based compensation. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share increased more than 50% to $0.32, exceeding our target range. We achieved these strong results even as we continued to invest in our marketing efforts and product innovation. ", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 26% in Q3, down substantially from year-ago levels, primarily due to the continued optimization of our international operations and the reenactment of an R&D tax credit. ", "For modeling purposes, we think that a 28% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for FY08. ", "Turning now to bookings, we continue to execute well on contract mix. Greater than 95% of Q3 product orders were booked as rateable licenses, with less than 5% booked up front. A large long-term contract during the quarter brought the average length of our renewable customer license commitments to greater than four years. This metric will continue to fluctuate quarterly depending on the mix of contracts signed, but would typically be in the three-year range. ", "Turning now to cash and balance sheet items, cash and short-term investments increased $27 million sequentially to $794 million, due to strong operating cash flow of $116 million. ", "Capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter. We continued to execute on our buy-back program and repurchased 2.2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $59 million. ", "During the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we have spent $141 million repurchasing approximately 5.3 million shares, and we have $441 million remaining on our current authorization. ", "Because of the timing of a large invoice at the end of the quarter, Q3 net accounts receivable increased to $204.8 million, and DSOs were slightly above our historical range at 61 days. ", "Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $635.4 million. ", "At the end of Q3, we had approximately 5,100 employees with a slight sequential increase due primarily to the acquisition of ArchPro. ", "Now, as Aart discussed, we closed two strategic acquisitions during the quarter. In June, we acquired ArchPro Design Automation for low power verification. It was an all-cash deal valued at $12.9 million. In July, we acquired the semiconductor IP assets of MOSAID Technologies, a developer and licensor of semiconductor IP. It was an all-cash deal valued at $15.3 million. These acquisitions are included in our guidance for the rest of FY07. ", "And now, addressing guidance for the fourth quarter of FY07, our targets are: revenue between $300 million and $310 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $261 million and $277 million, which includes approximately $17 million of share-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $236 million and $246 million; other income and expense between $3 million and $6 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 25% and 26%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 151 million; GAAP earnings of $0.18 to $0.26 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.34 to $0.37 per share. ", "We expect greater than 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog. ", "For fiscal year 2007, we are again raising the low end of our revenue range with our new target between $1.195 billion and $1.205 billion, reflecting an annual increase of 9% to 10%; total non-GAAP expenses to be 2% to 3% higher than FY06; a non-GAAP tax rate of about 25%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 151 million; GAAP earnings per share between $0.78 and $0.86, which includes the impact of approximately $64 million in share-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.34 -- we\u2019ve increased the low-end of our guidance range by $0.04 and the high-end by $0.01; operating margin of approximately 20%. ", "Over the next four quarters, we expect approximately $1.02 billion of our beginning of quarter backlog to turn to revenue. We are raising our cash flow from operations target to greater than $325 million. ", "In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results. We\u2019ve expanded our profitability, increased cash from operations, and our strong balance sheet stands ready to support our future growth objectives. We\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering shareholder returns by improving our capital structure, primarily driven by our stock buy-back program. ", "With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Harlan Sur from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Good afternoon. Nice execution on the July quarter. Aart, first question for you; in the memory market, both DRAM and NAND are really sort of the technology drivers now for the semiconductor industry from a manufacturing perspective. Clearly the adoption of memory, especially Flash in the consumer markets is driving a significant amount of growth going forward in this segment of the market space. ", "Can you just talk about how Synopsys is positioned to take advantage of these trends in memory? At a minimum, I would assume that it\u2019s analog verification, DFN and IP. Am I missing anything? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, thanks for answering your own question. You got it right that the technologies where we have the most impact is clearly the verification side. Actually, interestingly enough, increasingly even some synthesis because with these very large memories, there\u2019s more and more very, very sophisticated control logic that goes around it and so memory is far and away now from just being a bunch of transistors. ", "Having said that, if I my just quibble slightly with your opening, as much as memory is one of the technology drivers, the technology that is used for logic is quite a bit different than what is used in the memory domain. And of course, all of those are continuing going for smaller geometries but they do demand today a slightly different approach. And so for us, it is important to be well-connected to both the leaders on the logical side and the leaders on the memory side and I think we absolutely are. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks for that, and then another question for the team, if I look at the next four quarter backlog, it went up by about $50 million, obviously as a result I think of the larger deal that you signed in the July quarter, so I\u2019m a little perplexed why the fourth quarter revenue outlook wouldn\u2019t be going up at a minimum about $10 million to $13 million sequentially versus the July quarter. Maybe the team can help me understand that. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Well, part of the answer is that as new deals come in, you can\u2019t assume that every deal gets renewed on the last day of its existence, meaning that the backlog can grow in the future without impacting necessarily the quarter that we are in presently or even the next one. These things really are extremely complex layering in of backlog. ", "Secondly, overall the run-rates with many of those companies goes, just goes steadily up, assuming that we do a good job driving them in that direction, and it is fairly rare that you would have enormous discontinuities unless you sort of layer in that whole new set of products. ", "Lastly, I am glad that you\u2019re observing these numbers and at the same time always a little bit weary of over-interpreting a single quarter because there is a little bit of fluctuation and things are somewhat lumpy. But in aggregate over a long period of time, I think these are good long-term indicators. ", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks, Aart. ", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Matt Petkun from D.A. Davidson & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Thanks for taking my call. Just one real quick question for me, Aart; I noticed last week Cadence and Mentor are partnering on what they are calling an open SystemVerilog verification methodology. I\u2019m wondering what your read is on that new methodology that they are purporting to be supporting and how that compares to the SystemVerilog that you guys have been supporting for some time. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. The first comment is that these days, everything starts with the word open and so that\u2019s not a surprise. What is interesting is that, not a surprise either, SystemVerilog has really moved forward very, very rapidly. You may recall that we introduced the notion of SystemVerilog about three-and-a-half years ago, initially to a great deal of skepticism. Today, I can tell you that a vast majority of the advanced users already are well entrenched. We have hundreds of users and I would think that Synopsys is way ahead on this ball game today. ", "Now, there are many reasons why we are ahead. Not only is it a good standard but it is also because of the technology that we have deployed behind it. And so, notwithstanding all the languages and standards and so on, at the end of the day, the raw strength of the tools really makes a difference. We have a broad set of partners, not just in the utilization side but also on the IP side around that. So I think we are doing very well with it. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay, and then just one other question for Brian; when we look at the operating margin expansion that you anticipate for fiscal \u201908, do you see more synergy coming out of your R&D efforts or out of sales and marketing? And I assume that the big up-tick we saw in this most recent quarter was the result of that large deal in the sales and marketing line item. ", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, that\u2019s correct, Matt. The expense piece itself grew in the third quarter associated with the large transaction of business, both in the third quarter and for the total year. When we look ahead to some of the early discussions on 2008, we\u2019d anticipate that expenses of course grow less than the rate of revenue, therefore contributing to margin growth in the year. And you know, we are working through the final details of that plan of next year but obviously we are committed to continued margin expansion for 2008, as well as our longer term targets in the mid to high 20 range. ", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Brian, I would like to ask you about the duration of the contracts in the quarter. Obviously Intel took the average up significantly, presumably it was about a five-year deal. The question is, if it made sense to do a deal that long for that customer, would it make sense to do similarly long deals for other important customers as well? ", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, it makes sense. Of course, our focus is on the run-rate for the quarter as well, that we continue to expand our relationships with all these customers. And as Aart mentioned, getting deeper in terms of increased partnerships, working closely in terms of sharing growth with their business and us, so it\u2019s all good directions. This particular agreement f course locking in a company the size of Intel without commenting specifically on the length of the contract agreement was that this is the right thing to do for Synopsys and for Intel at this point. ", "You know, different customers have different time horizons in mind. We typically expect our contract length is in that three-year range, so this is again expanding relationships during this quarter. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Aart, a two-fold question on technology; could you elaborate on the nature of the technology collaboration you will be doing with Intel? Synopsys has a history of working closely with different customers from time to time, Toshiba, for example, in the past, and other examples. Where specifically will you focus with Intel? ", "And then secondly otherwise, are there any products in the portfolio that are undergoing or would need to undergo any significant rewrites? Sooner or later, any product and software would need to through some rebuild. Is there anything of that kind that you foresee for Synopsys products? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "We never comment on anything that we do with specific customers unless there has been a specific press release, and given the level of sophistication of Intel, that certainly applies to them as well. ", "Generically though, I can say that I foresee that with a number of customers, we are moving towards a closer and closer relationship for a variety of reasons, one of which is that the level of sophistication of the support we provide as a material impact on the success and differentiation in their utilization. Secondly, a number of our customers have very good insight as to some of the technology development that we can do together to actually accelerate our technology. And so I think that is sort of the general categories that these types of things fall under. ", "Now, regarding rewrite, most people don\u2019t fully appreciate that in the vast majority of the cases we have an ongoing rewriting happening in our code, and there is very good reason for that, which is we actually deliver an enormous amount of innovation, but what is not always fully understood is that all of that innovation has to be 100% plus backward-compatible with 15 years of ways of doing chips. This is actually quite a unique set of requirements that we\u2019ve been able to live up very, very well. ", "If I can take an example for that, our in that sense oldest or youngest product, depending on how you want to look at it, is the design compiler topographical, which has seen enormous progress in terms of understanding place and route capabilities in the synthesis and yet being in some ways a good old design compiler that you can trust and that works very well and that does all these things that it always used to do. And from a software development perspective, I can tell you it\u2019s not an easy feat to do at times. ", "And so from the customer perspective, in general as much as they are interested by brand new features, they really hate discontinuities and I\u2019ve always said revolutionary technology needs to be rolled out in evolutionary fashion. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Final question; could you comment, Aart, at all, any vertical market expectations you have, particularly going into \u201908? Is there anything you see on the mobile side, the automotive side? Any other verticals that you think will become particularly incremental for you or the industry over the next year or two? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "You know, I think that is almost the same as asking the question which vertical segments will do well, with or without us, because it is clear that some market segments have a lot more opportunity than others. ", "One of the things I would highlight is the tremendous importance of everything that touches the word video through the entire food chain. There\u2019s no question that video does for baud rate, for storage, for even display and capture, the same as word MIPS did for processors 15 years ago, which is more is better. ", "If you see the many clips that people download just from YouTube, it\u2019s just going to be a matter of time that that stuff needs to high definition. So those are the types of things that transcend a number of the key traditional verticals. One of the reasons we prefer to look at it almost from these technology requirement perspectives is because they become much more actionable than just saying here\u2019s the memory segment. And as we alluded to earlier, even the memory segment is suddenly very, very interested in synthesis, so it\u2019s not the good old memory segment from the past. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Aart. ", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Terence Whalen with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ", "Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup", "Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter. My first question, Aart, is a pretty straightforward one. You typically give active designs and cumulative tape-outs for 65 and 45, and I was wondering if I could get those. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Let\u2019s look at 65-nanometer first. We are right now tracking 488 designs, and this is probably the last time that we track because once we pass 500, the amount of work that goes into having very good numbers is very difficult, so about 488 active designs, 241 tape-outs. Again, the majority with Synopsys physical tools. ", "Looking at 45-nanometer, we are tracking 73 active designs. That is up from 52 last quarter and 16 tape-outs, and we are also tracking already several 32-nanometer designs. ", "So fundamentally, the state-of-the-art leaders are moving forward unencumbered. ", "Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup", "Great, and then secondly, Aart, I think you mentioned that intellectual property represents one of your higher growth adjacency opportunities. You\u2019ve obviously had the recent acquisition there. I was wondering, does that comment reflect at all on the opportunity in design for manufacturer or do you think both offer similar growth potential looking into 2008? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, certainly looking back, if we look at the trailing 12-month revenue growth, you see about 23% to 24% for IP and 21% to 22% for DFM, so they are fairly similar. They are different in nature in that IP comes truly in sort of incremental building blocks, if I can call it that, and we certainly have a strong position, not just by virtue of the collection of things that we have but just as importantly by virtue of the process of be able to roll out high quality IP almost like a factory now. That took a long time to build. ", "On the DFM side, it\u2019s a little different. There I think the game has already moved more towards the integration of extremely sophisticated techniques that all add up to how do you modify design to avoid challenges in the first place? And so in that sense, it is a little bit more technically like traditional, very, very sophisticated software but it is a new domain and we do expect very good growth. So right now, I would handicap \u201908 as probably IP first, DFM second. ", "Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup", "Okay, great, and one last one, if I could; I think Aart, in your opening statement, you mentioned that you are beginning to see visible progress from your marketing strategy. I was wondering if you could just drill down with a little more specificity. Are you referring to segmentation or low power? And that\u2019s it for me, thanks. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, you know, I think this builds a little bit on Jay\u2019s question, which is the sheer fact that we use the term segmentation at Synopsys is almost novel. But it is also clear that you can approach it from the traditional segments, such as memory, automotive, et cetera, and look at it in terms of how well are we doing with these players and how well are we moving forward. ", "You can approach it from a stratification in terms of need, and there we have made some progress because you saw, for example, IC Compiler Express be a different type of tool than the one that we\u2019ve used for the advanced end. We\u2019ve done the same for IP. We are going to do more on verification. ", "And then you can finally approach it more from a solution perspective and my focus on low power was chosen on purpose because it\u2019s the single most important design constraint that\u2019s actually hard to do when you add to it timing and schedule and test and other things. ", "So I think what I can report after about now I guess nine months of moving in this direction, that the vocabulary has set in and that we are starting to now look at the insight and turning them into action. And you saw the first results of that and I think that\u2019s going to be ongoing from now on. ", "Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Next we go to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. Aart, I just want to drill down a little bit on the DFM, in terms of basically I see it\u2019s a record number for Q3, and you are saying that is going to grow slower than IP, but is it expanding into the areas beyond just a little calculation, some of the variability in the processing, like CMP or other areas of processing? And hopefully your new position, new board membership gives you more insight into this kind of variability. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "First, I am not sure that I said it would grow slower than IP. Maybe I just said that IP may grow faster than DFM. The reality is I don\u2019t think that I can really tell much difference right now going forward because most of these areas are very promising. They just behave very differently. ", "Having said that, I think you are alluding correctly to the fact that within the general realm of DFM, different capabilities are sort of gradually coming online and gradually becoming important and we can absolutely see that things such as DMP and a few others are starting to sort of turn the corner in terms of being essential, amounting in between 65 and 45 or 55-nanometer, we see even some of those designs. ", "And there\u2019s a slew of these capabilities that we have available and that suddenly are sort of hitting the interest meter of our customers. If I take another one that falls into that category is the notion of stress, where essentially certain structures inside of a transistor are under stress and therefore change their electrical characteristic. Well, that\u2019s suddenly very important because that may impact substantially the timing of a circuit. ", "And so all of these things are sort of now suddenly becoming important but we have invested in them for a long time and we have connected many of those already in a flow that is truly could be viewed as a design for manufacturing flow. ", "So I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there and we are encouraged by the need for the technology. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "And the question of 65-nanometer adoption, I don\u2019t have a good sense of that design, the number of designs and tape-outs. What does that convey in terms of what do you expect that for at this stage for 90-nanometer? If you can give a comparison and the other thing I want you to comment, if you could, is what we are hearing is that foundries are not, do not have a very good utilization at 65-nanometer as they expected, and the adoption in terms of [inaudible] has been slower. Any comment on that would be helpful. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Certainly. Well, you know, we are in the unfortunate situation that we literally now have multiple years of quarter-by-quarter data and to my own surprise, we saw about three or four quarters ago, that 90-nanometer tracked 130, 65 tracked 90, and 45 tracked 65 by virtually exactly two years, and the present numbers reflect that again. ", "So what that tells me is that the advanced guys, and that\u2019s not the same as the lagging group, that the advanced guys are absolutely still competing on smaller geometries. By the way, that also explains why the foundries are not necessarily there yet because most of the advanced guys are or used to be, if I can call it that, IDMs where they drove the advanced technology and then executed it themselves. ", "I think that will change over time, as now the foundries are picking up more of the technology development and will be forced into moving a little bit faster and we definitely see a change there as well. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you, and a couple of quick questions on the income statement. The other income, if you take out the non-recurring item, is close to $7 million. That is probably -- your run-rate of interest income is about $7 million, I\u2019m guessing. You can correct me on that, and your guidance, you have been guiding $3 million to $6 million. Can you explain the disparity there in terms of guidance? ", "Brian M. Beattie", "You\u2019re right, Mahesh. What we\u2019ve been looking at is the OI&E line is primarily representing our interest income, and actually with higher cash balances, by focusing on our operating cash flows, we\u2019re able to drive that number higher and as a result, our interest income continues to grow. ", "We had $6 million in the second quarter. It went to $7 million in the third quarter. I think we are being a little cautious perhaps on the interest rate assumption for the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s in the same range as what we\u2019d expect to see this quarter. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "And a quick one on the buy-back strategy; is it your long-term strategy is going to basically keep your share count flat or even going down slightly, the buy-back will be driven by that? ", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, exactly. We\u2019ve looked back over history the last three years and we continue to buy back more shares than what we had issued in terms of options, and then more recently in terms of RSUs. ", "We also continue to focus in 2007 on actually reducing the number of options and RSUs that we intend to issue by design, and therefore as a result continue to address reducing the number of shares outstanding. ", "The offset to that proactive program here is really focused on the fact that our share price continues to go up, and as a result, the dilutive impact of the additional share price is one of the offsets we are also trying to drive and get the absolute share count down on a fully diluted basis. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Richard Valera from Needham & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good evening. Aart, you had several notable success of IC Compiler in terms of customers that have adopted it, and yet it seems that the growth in the Galaxy area is still pretty modest year over year. Can you say if you are getting the value you expected to get from IC Compiler in terms of I believe it was around a 30%, 35% up-lift in list price, or was there anything else that is keeping that line from growing in terms of competitive or pricing pressures? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Well, the ratio in terms of the list prices is unchanged. I think one of the reasons we are starting to report a little bit more from the perspective of core EDA is because in so many cases, it is actually at times a little difficult to distinguish between Galaxy and Discovery. ", "In general, IC Compiler is doing very well for us and so the replacement of PC Astro is well on track. There is definitely pricing stress throughout the industry, just because a lot of competitors but even within that, I think we\u2019ve done reasonably well. So if you look at core EDA growth, it\u2019s about 8%. Maybe we have been a little too stringent on Galaxy but that\u2019s just sort of the reality that we deal with right now. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. Brian, could you just reiterate the initial fiscal 2008 guidance that you said? What were those ranges you had given out? ", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, I clarified that it wasn\u2019t specifically guidance for the year but we are really just commenting on the Wall Street expectations at this point. And what that reflects is that we said we are comfortable with the EPS growth that was forecast in the range of 16% to 19%; revenue growth of 7% to 8%; and also that the assumptions of the ops margin expansion was also in line. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And understanding that everything is preliminary for fiscal \u201908, in terms of what would drive that growth, would you care to comment on that at all, Aart? It sounds like it is probably the two adjacencies you\u2019ve talked about, which are sort of faster growing. But would you give any color at all on what drives that 7% to 8% top line growth? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Again, with maybe reiterating the caveat that we did not want to be in a position of giving guidance. This is not guidance. The plan is not finished, therefore that was not the intent. The intent was to respond to the very fact that there\u2019s so much fluctuation on Wall Street, people are just worried, is this a good or bad company, that we are actually a very solid company given the business model, and that\u2019s why we can make these statements. ", "Having said that, going forward clearly we see multiple opportunities. We feel that actually our core EDA is quite strong and the fact that we have seen the benefit of many of the integrations now gradually become more and more visible to customers that before didn\u2019t fully appreciate this, I think bodes well for our core EDA position. ", "Now, around those, clearly the adjacencies are not only doing well on their own but I think they are also strategically important in helping the core, or you could turn it around -- the core helps the adjacencies because the better we do in IP, the better we for our tools and vice versa. ", "And so we are actually quite positive about the opportunity space that we have and our comments going forward were almost exclusively based on the fact that the business model allowed us to already project that we would be well in tune with what, at a minimum, Wall Street is expecting. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "And our final question is from Dennis Wassung from Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams", "Thanks. Good afternoon. First question, another follow-up on the Intel contract and also you alluded to some other large contracts in the quarter. I\u2019m just curious; as you look at these transactions and obviously they are larger in scope than the prior contracts, you talked about increasing your run-rate, I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment as to how much of that increase that you are seeing at this point is increased usage of the same class of tools or basically higher seat counts, higher capacity versus how much, for Intel, for example, being the primary supplier there and expanding your relationship, are you really getting at the new categories of tools that you weren\u2019t currently in at Intel? Namely, are you taking some share away from other people in the process? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "Dennis, with the caveat that I don\u2019t want to say anything more than what I said specifically about Intel, as we protect the privacy of all of our customers, we did say there that it was a broadening of pretty much every dimension, meaning the contracts in the various forms of sizes, the product utilization. ", "What is clear is that when we are looking at R&D collaboration, one of the reasons that we are very, very happy to work with Intel is because they are a phenomenally strong player from a silicon technology point of view. ", "As we see that increasingly, a number of semiconductor companies can no longer afford the development costs or the sophistication required to be on the leading edge, working closely in a technology relationship with the company that arguably is the most advanced one is something that if we do a good job, will be of very high value to both parties. ", "And I would not want to restrict at all that value to the existing tools, although there\u2019s no question that on the existing tools, we have already found areas where we can do better than what we have, so it will accelerate our technology. ", "Talking a little bit more broadly, I think that these collaboration relationships will be important going forward and I believe that over the years, we have built a skill-set within Synopsys that knows how to manage this relatively small scale that we now can gradually go broader scale, and Intel is clearly a trailblazer with us in that. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, and just a quick follow-up on the Intel side of it specifically, obviously Intel has been a very important customer for you for a number of years here, and likely the primary EDA supplier for Synopsys here, so is the real change or I guess difference in this agreement specifically, is that more the technology collaboration aspect of this that\u2019s the key differentiator between this and former relationships or contracts with Intel? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think there are many positive changes. The reason I like to highlight specifically the collaboration is because from a strategic point of view, I think it has the broadest ramifications, and it has ramifications between the two companies in terms of the value they get, the product evolution, their product utilization, et cetera. But it also has ramifications for other companies that will over time benefit from doing business with us because they can rest assured that we will stay very close to the leading edge of technology. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, and last one for me on the manufacturing side, you alluded to the fact that you guys are integrating some of your OPC capabilities with the mass data prep technology. I\u2019m just curious at this point, I know Synopsys has amassed a long list of manufacturing-related technologies, whether it\u2019s TCAD or PrimeYield or the OPC stuff -- how much of your business at this point really is an integrated offering in that area, or is it more driven by point tool sales in some of these areas of manufacturing? ", "Aart J. de Geus", "That\u2019s a very good question because I think in many situations, customers use sort of all of our tools and so they are sort of applauding on the sidelines every time that we do better integration because the better integration initially does not change the nature of the tools -- it immediately has major impact on throughput. ", "In the medium term though, it does change gradually the nature of the tools because now they start to play off better off of each other. In the long-term, it\u2019s even broader than that. It really brings a vision and an understanding of manufacturing into the design world and I think that is where it has to go, because if you don\u2019t do that, it will be absolutely impossible to do layouts and expect high yield. There are just too many places where a small mistake gets multiplied by thousands and thousands of occurrences. ", "And so I think this integration is one of the key directions and it is sort of a little bit of a catch-all word for really a substantial evolution in an entire field, but it is simultaneously built on making sure that we have the best product as well. ", "Dennis Wassung - Canaccord Adams", "Great. Thank you. ", "Aart J. de Geus", "It sounds like we have arrived at the end of the quarter. We appreciate -- well, I guess we have arrived at the end of the quarter but also at the end of the earnings release. We appreciate the time you spent with us. We clearly are looking back on a very strong Q3 and have a good outlook on Q4 and even beyond that, and so we appreciate the time and as usual, Brian, Lisa and I are available after the call.

I'm happy to report a strong Q4, a strongfiscal '07, and a strong outlook for 2008. Three realities account for our excellent results and confidence in ouroutlook: ", "First, exceptional financial execution and visibility. ", "Second, impressive technology strength and a substantialpipeline of new products and capabilities for 2008. ", "Third, the favorable customer landscape for Synopsys, withincreased commitments to our comprehensive solutions.", "Let me begin with our financial results. In Q4 and fiscal2007 we achieved the highest level of business in Synopsys history. We eithermet or exceeded all of our goals in terms of strong revenue and earnings growth;a substantial increase in ops margin; and excellent cash flow. ", "Specifically, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of$0.40 for the quarter and $1.37 for the year, substantially above the target  communicated at the beginning of FY07.", "With Q4 revenues of $315 million, we grew our business 11%for the year to more than $1.2 billion, also above our target. We delivered thatrevenue while adhering to our uniquely predictable business model with over 90%time-based licenses. ", "Through disciplined expense control and a focus onefficiency, we improved ops margin over last year from 14% to 20%; again, aheadof our targets. We grew our backlog to $2.5 billion, cementing our confidencein the outlook for '08 with over 80% of revenue in hand for the coming year;over 90% for the coming quarter; and already substantial visibility into 2009and 2010.", "Based on our results, our outstanding backlog and ourpromising technology pipeline, we expect strong results for 2008 as well. In'08 we expect to grow revenue 7.5% to 8.5% while rigorously adhering to ourratable business model. We plan to expand operating margin an additional 300basis points to 23%, and we expect very solid earnings growth.", "Let's take a look at the context in which we offer thisguidance. In spite of the turmoil in the financial markets, our customer'senvironments remained relatively steady. The consumer segment continues todrive growth in unit volume and the quest for more functionality is far fromover. ", "Differentiation through design is increasingly mission critical,boding well for EDA and for Synopsys in particular. Our best users are rapidlyadopting 65 and 45 nanometer silicon nodes, with 65 nanometer becoming muchmore broadly used and 45 nanometer tape-outs accelerating. At the same time,mainstream users wring more capabilities out of mature and cost effective 90,130, and even 180 nanometer nodes. ", "From a design perspective, three drivers clearly stand out.The rates for more functions on chips; low power end yield and the mostencompassing technical challenges, and productivity and predictability ofschedules as the top execution concerns. With our comprehensive technologyfoundation, Synopsis is uniquely positioned to meet these needs. ", "One especially notable growth element for us this year wasthe substantial increase in our territory business. These are start-ups to mid-sizedcompanies served by a local geographic team. As you recall, about a year ago weinstituted a strategy to better address this user segment by:", "(a) providing a combination of easy to adopt solutionsincluding tools, IP, and services;", "(b) introducing new products targeted at their specificneeds; and ", "(c) increasing our marketing and sales focus to betterunderstand and penetrate the segment. ", "The results so far are extremely encouraging. With furthertuning, we are poised to accelerate our progress with these customers in 2008.", "From a business perspective, every product group came insignificantly over plan for both the quarter and the full year.  In core EDA, which grew 9% for the year, wehad many successes. In physical implementation, IC Compiler continues to serveas the mainstay for the most advanced designs in the world. ", "Our overall transition is right on track. The number of tape-outsis growing massively and IC Compiler is helping to solve some of the mostdifficult technology challenges in the world. In fact, the first ever 45 nanometerconsumer chip in volume production was designed using IC Compiler. ", "Our synthesis and sign-off tools extended their technologyleads, especially with our unique topographical capabilities resulting in solidnumbers for the year. In verification, both digital and analog mixed-signal itvery well.  Digital verificationdelivered outstanding results, substantially outpacing market growth for theyear. In Q3, we executed the ArchPro acquisition, adding a new dimension of lowpower verification to our simulation offering. ", "On the AMS side, our new XA technology combined the accuracyof SPICE with the speed of FastSPICE. This went into limited availability inSeptember and is already enjoying solid acceptance by customers. In Q4, weexpanded our analog mixed signal verification position by acquiring SandworkDesign, a leader in AMS analysis and debugging products. ", "Moving on to our design for manufacturing adjacency, wedelivered very good results as well. In Q4, we had several high profilecompetitive wins including a large global semiconductor company who adopted ouroptical proximity correction over its incumbent solution for 45 nanometerproduction. ", "Complementing our individual product successes, we are rapidlyintegrating the design for manufacturing flow as well. Following on the heels ofour first integration, PrimeYield, in Q4 we completed yet another key piece: thelinking of Odyssey, our yield management solution, with Design [for test]. ", "We hada very strong year in IP and systems as well. We greatly tuned our IPdevelopments and technology coding processes, providing a very responsive and cost-efficientoffering for our customers, while maintaining the high-quality IP they havecome to expect. We demonstrated our design process discipline through our30-day integration of the DDR assets of MOSAID acquired last quarter. In fact,we've already had our first orders for the DDR cores. ", "Looking forward to 2008, we have a substantial pipeline ofnew products and capabilities with first deliveries on track for this December.Overall, we expect significant new technology advances throughout ourportfolio, focused primarily on speed and productivity. ", "With run support of parallel processing throughout our digitalflow, from synthesis to physical design through sign-off. Parallel processingenables significant speed improvements by taking advantage of the multipleprocessors now available in compute servers. ", "In physical design, we are shipping completely integratedfloor-planning capability, two to three times faster performance and brand newunmatched DFM capabilities for 65 nanometer and below. We will take sign off tothe next level, with 2x performance improvements and subtle but significant manufacturingchecks. We plan rapid advances in verification with expanded, low-powercapability and a new solution targeted for the broader market. ", "In our analog/mixed-signal flow, we will introduce a broadset of parallel processing capabilities as well. But even more importantly, we willintroduce our brand new, custom design solution. This long awaited set ofcapabilities will substantially complete our company product offering andincrease our total addressable market. ", "In DFM, we also plan to introduce a new tape-out flow. Thisflow intends to significantly speed up turnaround time for fabs by integratingall three lines of DFM -- lithography, TCAD and yield management. We'll alsolaunch the integration of our mask synthesis and mask data press solutions,allowing customers to do both in the time it now takes to do OBC alone.  Finally in IP, we will further expand ourproduct line with new, in-house developed products for USB 3.0, wireless USB,DDR, PCI Express 2.0, and SATA. ", "In conjunction with our support technology pipeline, let metalk about an even more compelling aspect of our corporate strength. Pushed bytechnical and economic challenges, customers are increasingly partnering withus to increase their design differentiation and decrease their costs and schedulerisks. Years ago, we anticipated that customer productivity would be greatlyaffected not only by tool quality but also by the needs for much moreintegrated solutions from concept to volume production. ", "So we focused on assembling a complete design system,including the links to IP and manufacturing. While every customer has uniqueneeds and its own transformational timeline, the power of increasedcollaboration has become obvious. This year we made excellent progress withsome of the leading semiconductor companies in the world. Last quarter, wecommunicated that we had moved several important long-term relationships to thenext level of collaboration, including Intel, who selected Synopsys as itsprimary EDA supplier.", "Last month, we announced that Renesas, another the world'stop ten semiconductor companies, chose Synopsys as its leading EDA supplier.With Renesas, technology collaboration on design and manufacturing efficiency issupported by increased use of our products and increased run rate. ", "As mentioned earlier, we also saw particularly positivemovement in the territories. A growing number of the smaller companies areusing Synopsys as the anchor to their design methodology with very goodresults. We believe that the segmentation initiatives towards more mainstream,easy to use products are paying off and we will continue our focus onbroadening our market opportunity. ", "To conclude, we had an outstanding 2007. We are looking at2008 and beyond with confidence based on three perspectives: a strong abilityto execute financially, supported by a unique business model with excellentbacklog; a comprehensive technology platform with a strong product pipeline;and an expanding set of collaborative and committed customer relationships.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Brian Beattie, ourCFO.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Aart and good afternoon, everyone. In my commentstoday, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal yearand provide guidance for 2008. As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAPand non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided areconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and thefinancial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisonswill be year over year unless I specify otherwise. ", "Synopsys delivered excellent fourth quarter and full fiscalyear results, executing well on many fronts. In fact, our strong performanceand momentum throughout the year enabled us to meet or exceed all of ouroriginal 2007 targets. ", "As Aart mentioned, Q4 revenues increased 11% to $315.2million and annual revenues also grew 11% to $1.212 billion. Business wasstrong across all product lines and geographies, reflecting the highest orders yearin Synopsys history, with total backlog growing to an industry-leading $2.5billion. This of course includes the benefit of a large Q3 customer agreement.However, even excluding this transaction, business was very robust. Onecustomer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. ", "Turning to expenses, Q4 non-GAAP costs and expenses declinedsequentially to $246.2 million as the variable compensation impact of anexcellent Q4 and full year was offset by overall expense control. For the full year,we achieved our total annual expense target of a very modest 3% increase,inclusive of our extra week of spending in Q1.", "GAAP expenses were $277.4 million, which included $1.1million of in-process R&D; $12.7 million of amortization of intangibleassets; and $15.3 million of share-based compensation. For the year, GAAPexpenses also increased just 3%. ", "I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on controllingexpenses. We've outsourced and offshored certain processes, shifted ouremployee base by approximately one-third in lower-cost geographies, and arefocused on streamlining our business processes. Of course, we are not done.", "Even as we invest in technology development, including theadvances we'll introduce in 2008, we plan to keep expense growth to about halfof revenue growth to reach our margin expansion targets.

I share the perspective that Asia Pac has grownrapidly and will continue to grow rapidly. At the same time, when I look at theworldwide revenue distribution by region for the last three years, I do seechange but the change is relatively minor. The reason for that is becauseutilization is going up rapidly in Asia Pac, but there are a number of globalcompanies where the buying patterns may still be centralized at their headquarters,which typically for the large companies tend to be the U.S.  The revenue itself is an interesting but notquite sufficient indicator of what\u2019s happening in practice in the field.", "Secondly, you asked specifically about regions such as Europeand others. We do see that there are changes there as well. As you know FC, NXPand Infineon all three essentially have gone towards the path that I would say isfab light, not fabless.

In other words, can you still grow backlog year on year next year, oris it just to tough of a comparison?", "Aart De Geus", "", "I think it is a tricky comparison no matter what becauseit\u2019s always a function of a few very, very large deals that when once you getthem obviously backlog goes up and then for the next typically average threeyears, they roll off gradually. ", "Secondly, the timing of those or indeed the length of thedeals if it is beyond three years would impact that. ", "Having said that, I think almost more important from yourperspective should be our confidence in coming into a given year with a strongcoverage because that is really what\u2019s giving us the ability to predict theshort and medium term well, thus reducing substantially the financial risk. ", "Secondly, it allows us to tune carefully how we grow thecompany and take maximum advantage that we have. So obviously growing backlog,whichever it is, be it the three months, the 12 months or the overall backlogis all good. The short-term backlog is really what determines the financialsecurity of the company.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "", "Last question would be on cash collection. On some of thoselarge deals that you did this past fiscal year, how much of that has alreadybeen collected or what were the collection terms? Are they annual over the lifeof the contract? I am just trying to get a sense as to how that will contributeto cash flow in this fiscal year?", "Brian Beattie", "", "We factored in obviously to the forecast for \u201808 cash thepayments; receipts are always just about the timing, does it fall into \u201807 or doesit move into 2008? With the performance and focus we had on DSOs coming in at36 days was great. We almost doubled our cash to $433 million in \u201807 and thenour estimates for 2008 take into account that there were two payments from a prettysignificant customer that did come in, were both invoiced and collected in2007. So that obviously doesn\u2019t follow and replicate itself again in 2008. itis all factored into our guidance on cash.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "", "I would assume that is factored into the guidance, so thetwo payments came in early; what\u2019s left? Are all the big collections on the bigcontracts already done, or is there more left?", "Brian Beattie", "", "There is clearly more left. That\u2019s what we factored into ourcash forecast for 2008, to be over $325 million of operating cash flow for nextyear, all of those ongoing payments, including annual payments from thesecustomers continue to come in 2008.", "Aart De Geus", "", "With that, if you don\u2019t mind, let me close off the call. Wehave passed our one hour allotment. We really appreciate your time, and ofcourse your support over this past year. \u201807 in many, many ways was a very,very strong year but clearly the most important aspect of the strength of \u201807is the confidence it gives us for \u201808.

Davidson & Company", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Synopsys Incorporated Earnings Call for first quarter and fiscal year 2008. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)", "Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, I'll announce the time remaining on the conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. These statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today.", "The company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2007 and in our earnings release for the first quarter, issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, can be found in our first quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report another good quarter for Synopsys. We met our target and are confirming yearly guidance. In Q1, we delivered solid on-track progress towards our continued '08 objective of 7.5 to 8.5 top line growth; 300 basis point of ops margin improvement, rollout of substantial new and enhanced technology and deepening customer relationship through collaboration on viable productivity improvement.", "Specifically, this quarter we achieved non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, more than 40% year-over-year growth. Revenue came in at $350 million at the high end of our target range. With more than 90% time based license revenue, we stuck firmly to our uniquely predictable business model.", "Our disciplined ops margin improvement progressed quite well with Q1 coming in at 25.6%. This puts us solidly on track towards our annual goal of 23%. Finally, we shift major new product releases in December with a large number of key enhancements and new capabilities. Overall, we exit the first quarter with all year solidly on track, in terms of revenue, earnings, cash flow, ops margin and technology.", "Before moving to some product highlights, let me characterize the customer environment and how we see little behavioral change. Although the uncertainty in the macro environment may have intensified, it isn't new. And while they have shifted in internal investment decision, they haven't changed the R&D side of the semiconductor market.", "For the last few years, volume growth and cost sensitivity have been the driving forces for most of our customers against the backdrop of continued technology complexity. They focused on two things, differentiation for variant markets and productivity improvements for everything out.", "Synopsys is very well positioned for exactly the situation. For a number of years, we followed a systematic strategy. First, continue to deliver best-in-class tools across the vast majority of our portfolio and lead in the adoption of new technology notes. Second, build a comprehensive portfolio of core EDA tools. This year, we will be completing that goal with the addition of analog implementation capability. Third, assemble and link these tools into coherent design verification platforms aimed at end-to-end design productivity and predictability.", "Fourth, build technical and collaboration links to manufacturing that will assure performance, power and yield. Fifth, build a bridge to the growing space of software and system design to the high quality IP block and virtual prototyping capability. And finally, grow sophisticated global support and service structure to engage customers on the most challenging design. As a number of semiconductor companies now shift some of their internal investments from manufacturing to design, we expect our R&D spending for our solutions to stay healthy.", "We also anticipate that customers will continue to streamline the number of vendors they have, and consider a higher level of relationships with select companies such as Synopsys. As a result, we project that EDA will grow and we will gain market share in 2008, all under our very stable business model. With that backdrop, let me provide some product and technology highlights for the quarter.", "In core EDA, we made excellent progress both in adoption and use of our software. We also shifted significant enhancement and additions of our Galaxy Design and Discovery Verification Platforms. For example, our Matsushita, the global consumer electronic company behind the Panasonic brand, used our Galaxy Flow, including IC Complier, to design the world's first 45-nanometer consumer chip in production.", "Matsushita achieved a smaller die size and just as importantly, lower power consumption using Galaxy. TSMC has notified us that IC Compiler is the first place in our system to be truly qualified for TSMC's 45-nanometer process. During the quarter, we also delivered to customers a major Galaxy Platform upgrade, which includes expanded capabilities in design compilers, fully integrated hierarchical design planning, faster performance in IC Compiler and a significant upgrade of PrimeTime yielding [technical difficulty] performance and lower memory consumption.", "Still to come in 2008 will be several other notable advances throughout our portfolio, focused mainly on speed and productivity. These include advances that take our high-end low power solutions to the broader market. Specifically in digital design; in 2008, we will introduce advances such as two-to-three times faster performance and brand new unmatched DFM capabilities for 65-nanometer and below.", "In digital verification, we are continuing to grow off an outstanding 2007, when where we greatly expanded our position in this segment of the market. The integration of ArchPro has increased our differentiation in terms of low power solutions. And we plan to introduce additional related capability during the year, specifically aimed at the mainstream market.", "In Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification, our new XA Technology, which combines accuracy of SPICE with the speed of FastSPICE is demonstrating very good customer success in its early availability. For example, iC-Haus, which manufactures chips for industrial, automotive and medical application, switched to XA after being able to reduce their simulation time from 6 hours to just minutes, while experiencing superior accuracy.", "New product advances to be introduced during the rest of the year will include a broad set of parallel processing capabilities. As mentioned earlier, this year, we'll introduce a Synopsys analog implementation solution. Although we have not yet formally announced the products, I can report that in Q1, we move from alpha to beta test and that the stability of the product has positively surprised our beta partners. This capability will increase Synopsys's pan, but it also removes competitive challenge as we complete our core EDA portfolio.", "Let me move on to design from manufacturing an emerging market segment still in its early stages. As you have heard from my earlier comments, we consider our links into manufacturing unique and essential in helping customers achieve their yield goals. Our strategy is to take full advantage of both the growth potential of this segment and the differentiation it confers to our core EDA offering.", "In Q1, we delivered the first phase of a new integrated mask synthesis and mask data prep solution, which dramatically reduces lithography turnaround time. Developed in collaboration with TSMC, this so called PCX capability has already been successfully tested at TSMC.", "Looking forward, we are also working on a new tape outflow that significantly speeds turnaround time for fabs by integrating Lithography, TCAT and Yield Management. Looking up to the system side of the design spectrum, we have made excellent progress there as well increasingly customers are realizing the economic benefits of commercial IP reuse versus building all blocks themselves.", "Excluding memory companies 17 of our top 20 customers now buying our IP. This quarter, we entered the most advanced end of the IP market with our first 45 nanometer analog mixed-signal customer. In addition, our newly acquired DDR products are doing very well. In these fast growing standards, we have already seen excellent customer interest and purchases.", "Our pipeline through the year features new in-house developed products for virtually all titles from USB, PCI Express, SATA and DDR. Our other thrust in the systems area, virtual platforms is also doing well. Virtual platforms creates models of hardware long before the chip is actually available, thus enabling software development up to six months earlier than with traditional methods. This quarter for example, a key phone architecture firm purchased our virtual platform solution to accelerate their software development.", "Closing off on the product, Q1 saw excellent progress in delivering new performance and capability to our users and we are excited about our robust technology pipeline in 2008. To conclude, Q1 was a very good start to 2008 and we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results throughout the year.", "We remain committed to growing our profitability, while adhering to our predictable business model. We had a comprehensive technology platform with a strong product pipeline and we are benefiting from an expanding set of collaborative and committed customer relationships.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Beattie, our CFO.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, I'll summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide with you with our guidance. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release and the financial supplement posted on our website.", "In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Well we also remind you that last year's Q1 comparable results include an extra physical week of revenues and expenses and events that occurs every seven years.", "Synopsys reported another very good quarter demonstrating the strength and predictability of our time-based business model. Q1 financial results were highlighted by solid revenue growth across all products and geographies resulting in substantial operating margin and earnings expansion. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $83 million worth of Synopsys shares during the quarter.", "And once again, we showed robust increases across our key revenue and profitability metrics. Total revenue increased 5% to $315.5 million at the high end of our target range, driven by our continued execution against our strategy. Normalizing for the extra week in 2007, revenue grew by 13% one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of our Q1 revenue.", "Turning to expenses, we continue to execute very well. Total non-GAAP expenses decreased 5% to $235 million, primarily due to the extra physical week in the year over quarter that I mentioned earlier. Expenses also came in slightly below our planned target range, driven primarily by some seasonal shifting out of hiring and other employee expenses. For the balance of the year, we expect to return to more typical expense profile with Q2 and Q3 progressing towards the traditionally higher Q4. And we continue to target expense growth at about half a revenue growth for all of 2008.", "The net effect of our solid top line growth and excellent delivery in expense management was 25.6% non-GAAP operating margin, a year-over-year increase of nearly 800 basis points. So, we are off to a tremendous start towards achieving our operating margin target of 23% for all of fiscal 2008 and we are committed to drive into the mid to high 20s over the next several years. We try to get there by making the appropriate level of investment back into the business to maintain our technology leadership and to drive sustainable long-term growth, while at the same time controlling expenses. ", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.31, with costs and expenses totaling $262 million. This included $11.6 million of amortization of intangible assets and $15.6 million of share-based compensation. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased more than 40% to $0.44 in the quarter.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, below our guidance primarily due to certain one-time tax benefits. For the entire year, we now expect the tax rate between 26% and 27%, which does not assume renewal of the R&D tax credit in the United States.", "Given our very predictable business models, revenue visibility remains strong. Upfront revenue was 4% of total revenue, well within our target range of less than 10%. And as expected, greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog. We are strong believers that our highly ratable business model is the right financial architecture for Synopsys and our customers.", "We put ourselves in the unique position of looking not only at 2008, but also into 2009 and 2010 with confidence. This will allow us to make a very proactive judgment as to where we want to invest and how we want to run our business and this is a great place to be in any environment. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was again, approximately three years.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Cash and short-term investments increased $181 million year-over-year to $860 million and as expected there was an operating cash outflow of $51 million in the quarter. Operating cash was affected by a recent agreement with an existing large customer that resulted in the shift of their annual payments from the first to the third quarter along with the timing of our seasonal incentive compensation cycles. We are confident that we'll achieve our fiscal 2008 operating cash flow target of greater than $325 million.", "Capital expenditures were $10 million in the quarter and we expect to reduce annual CapEx by about 10% over last year. We returned to a more aggressive pattern of buybacks this quarter. We purchased 3.4 million shares of Synopsys stock for $83 million and we have $347 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $142 million and we maintain industry leading DSOs of 41 days reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio and the timing of invoices. As you know, we do not factor our receivables. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $609 million. We ended Q1 with approximately 5,200 employees basically flat to our fourth quarter headcount.", "And now addressing our guidance. For the second quarter of FY08, our targets are revenue between $317 million and $325 million. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $269 million and $283 million, which includes approximately $17 million of share based compensation expense.", "Total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $242 million and $252 million. Other income and expense between $0 and $4 million, a non-GAAP tax rate between 26% and 27%, outstanding shares between $145 million and $150 million. GAAP earnings of $0.22 to $0.26 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.37 to $0.39 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2008 outlook. We reiterate that we expect revenue between $1.3 billion and $1.315 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7.5% to 8.5%. We plan to limit total non-GAAP expense growth to about half of revenue growth. A non-GAAP tax rate between 26% and 27%. Outstanding shares between $145 million and $150 million. GAAP earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.12, which includes the impact of approximately $66 million in share based compensation expense and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.61.", "We have increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.02 and then top end by $0.01 as a benefit from a lower tax rate is offset by slightly lower other income and expense items due to interest rate declines. Cash flow from operations is greater than $325 million. And as I mentioned earlier we are targeting a 23% non-GAAP operating margin for the full year.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 financial performance. We continue to execute against our strategy while delivering strong growth and profitability and hope to continue that momentum throughout 2008.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you and good afternoon and nice execution on the quarter. Aart I think you probably expected this question. But one of your major competitors did cite weakness at the very end of their December quarter. I guess the question to you is did the team at Synopsys see any significant changes in terms of new closure rates or aggressive pricing negotiations at the end of your January quarter, relative to prior quarters and as the customer pipeline in the first half of this year changed relative to your view of that let say three months even six months ago?", "Aart de Geus", "The answer is no and no and obviously we make sure that check with our sales force to see if there was any change in both the pipeline or how we execute it and the answer was no in both cases. Now, we read the newspapers as well and we can see that everybody is reading a lot of newspapers, but as for as it pertains to our domain. I don't expect actually very big changes because a number of our customers already shifting their investment for manufacturing into design. They have to differentiate in design, EDA is absolutely central to that and if you have strong technology that can help them with that, I think here in a good position and we are that.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "And to follow-up on that, there has been a lot of reference recently to semiconductor R&D spending trends in '08 not by you, but by others and I think it is getting more difficult to use R&D as a proxy for EDA tool spend given the moves by the IDMs to more sounds like business model, but I think what everyone is trying to get at, is what is the level of design activity and product development by your customers and is that slowing relative to what you saw in 2007 or is that actually accelerating here in '08?", "Aart de Geus", "First, I agree with your observation. There are so many moving parts right now that, a number of people have a tough time figuring out where this all lead. Let me start first with the designs. We do not see any major change in design starts period. We said all along that we see two phenomena. One is that the number of silicon nodes that stay alive has been growing, meaning that some of the older nodes are being pushed harder for performance in order to take advantage of the costs.", "On the other side of the spectrum, the most advanced node continue to be designed in at a feverish pace, and we are now seeing the move to 45 and even 32 being very, very active with the most advanced designers. So, from that perspective I think that the spending with the tools will continue.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. One last question, from me just a longer-term question. So, you talked a lot about your penetration and your competitiveness on litho-related tools and mask data prep and, so as we think about the 32-nanometer node and the move to double-patterning by your customers. Do you think is going to drive faster growth for your litho solutions?", "Aart de Geus", "I'd say yes, and no. Yes, definitely in the sense that the complexity of what needs to be done there just demands more compute power and more capability. I am a little careful with just jumping to the conclusion that every node drives more volume, partially because those people live with budget too and they don't change all that rapidly. But in general the most advanced technologies are to our advantage because that sort of where we as a company live.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. One last question for Brian, I noticed you're not giving us the same level of transparency on the product revenue segmentation, you no longer breaking out implementation and verification segments, any reasons for that?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, we I think we're telegraphing our metrics that we're going to continue to disclose to everybody in. We saw a trend over the last few years it's just more and more sales as the pool of core EDA tools. So, there will be a budget set aside there would be performance expectations and achieving that through both our verification and our upfront tools are the focus. So, it's really selling as a pool and therefore we put them there in that set that's how we're representing it.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Brian Beattie", "They both did really well in the quarter though as a composite of the business tool.", "Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Raj Seth, Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company", "Hi, thank you. Just a follow-up a little bit on the previous question. If hypothetically what I heard was targets haven't changed, you haven't seen any big shift in pricing etcetera. But if hypothetically booking started to weaken how do you think about managing the business? Are you -- I think you once told me that you had a hard line around operating margin targets and everything else was variable?", "Are you still thinking about the business that way if you saw in subsequent quarter's weakness in bookings, which wouldn't appear in revenues for a while? Would you begin to take early action to preserve margins and expenses, how do you think that?", "Brian Beattie", "Sure. Well, let me first remove the anxiety around the, if. We did not see bookings weaken. But as a matter of fact I think that I'd be reluctant to communicate to you that we had a strong quarter if under the covers we felt very differently. Having said that, if we did see any change I think that we'd pay a great deal of attention at the bottom line.", "But we're doing that no matter what. And so that's becomes only part of how we manage the company and maybe the best way to put that in numbers is to say, hey, we don't want to grow the expenses at more than about half of the revenue. And so, if revenue overtime were to become weaker we'd definitely pay even more attention to the expenses.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company", "Great thank you that's helpful. And just a quick one for Brian, any update on the tax settlement you talked about last quarter sort of what the amount is etcetera?", "Brian Beattie", "", "Yeah. The progress we've made is that the tentative settlement with the IRS has moved to Joint Committee of U.S. Congress as we anticipated. And relative to what the timing of getting that final sign-off it typically takes several months to get approved. And so, we've been informed. It's been sent in and it still will be a couple months to -- two to three months probably to get it resolved.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company", "Right, thanks. That's all I have. Nice quarter.", "Brian Beattie", "Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we've the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "", "Thanks. Good afternoon. I'd like to ask a question on the addressable market remaining for digital in particular. Do you have anyway of gauging how much or how many of the design infrastructure and upgrade decisions have been made specifically for 65 and 45 how would you characterize it in terms of remaining available runway for those kinds of decisions and commitments for designing to those nodes?", "And then secondly for either you or for Brian in terms of resource commitments and spending, could you go into little bit more detail on how you are portioning R&D specifically how much remaining ongoing spending is being done to complete legacy tool development even any remaining development pertaining to incorporating the Avanti technology I know that's quite a while back, but if there any work still going on there and how much is been a portion to wholly new efforts?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, let's talk with the changes to 65 and 45. We have reported to you over time -- sort of the evolution of 90, 65, 45, now 32 and when we talk about those people invariably is probably at a set of about top 20 customers that mean the block of that, because those are the people that move who lay ahead of the pack.", "And as a matter of fact, as I mentioned earlier the pack is sort of spreading out. So, at times given that we live so much in the advanced technology, I'm surprised myself when I talk to a customer, who is agonizing about the move from 130 to 90 and thinking how can we help these people because that is by now old technology from our perspective, but it is still very new for them.", "And so I think that there is a fairly big mainstream group of people that still needs to move, and will be moving over the coming couple of years because certainly 65-nanometer is very stable now and have a lot of benefits for people that want to add more functionality on their chips.", "Regarding the R&D expense allocation, the majority of our products are evolving continually. Is anything left in terms of integration of Avanti and Synopsys interesting, you asked the question because just a few days ago I mentioned to somebody I don't even recall now who is from Avanti and who is from Synopsys. And so in that sense I think that integration is entirely complete, but many of the products that we have are now intersection product that's where most of the investment goes, the rest is just some remedial fixing. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Backlog and preferred revenue question, Brian can you elaborate on the sequentially decline of deferred from Q4, which was substantially larger than we saw from fourth quarter to first quarters in the preceding two years was that tied into the cash payment you mentioned earlier that you took in third quarter from Intel in lieu of the current quarter or was there something else going on in terms of replenishing deferred in the current quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "We wouldn't mentioned customers by name, but yes there was a large contract signed in the third quarter of last year, more deferred revenues increased and then they would decline sequentially until not in the third quarter of 2008 when it would then increase again with the invoicing we take that into the receivables and then work that down throughout the year based on the annual payments. So, you got it exactly right.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then finally do you think you can rebuild backlog or grow backlog for the year as a whole? In other words, will you have a positive book-to-bill for the year as a whole?", "Aart de Geus", "We don't disclose book-to-bill. We don't disclose our backlog until the end of the year and so we have not changed that. That's all in all we are well on track on the business so that we were thinking to do and just to clarify -- when we look at how we structure our business right now, we put equal weight on the present year revenue as well as on the growth of backlog for the subsequent year and even two years further down, all the way to compensation of the top people being linked to that. And that is largely in order to make sure that we stay on a good growth trajectory, while managing the business in a fashion that has stability and a high degree of transparency.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Aart.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Matt Petkun with D.A. Davidson & Company. Please go ahead.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. Aart I was wondering given the changing landscape and the fact that it appears that you guys have the upper hand from an equity valuation standpoint as well as the balance sheet standpoint relative to your peers. Would it be reasonable to expect increased M&A activity for you guys this year?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, as you probably all know we never comment on M&A. We've done M&A in the past and when the opportunity is right, we're certainly always open. At this point and time, I think that the characterization of 2008 is going to be very much a year, where strong technology and good execution makes all the difference because as much as I do not see the financial behavior of our customers change the whole world right now is somewhat nervous about the economic status.", "Therefore buyers become discerning. And what that means is, they make sure that the companies they spend their money with will be around for long time, it will be solid and will give them actually the differentiation that they need in these times. And so, from that perspective I think our number one focus has to be absolutely on stellar execution and I guess so far so good.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then you mentioned the integrated litho product that you're talking about that would include TCAT, Yield Management amongst everything's. Will that be a post DRC product or would you integrate that with what you're doing in DRC as well?", "Aart De Geus", "It is definitely post DRC. Although it is very clear that increasingly all of these things are becoming gradually more integrated. And you may recall from my preamble that I said sort of a precedent that first you need to have good tools then they need to really start to talk well together and then it becomes more and more of an integrated platform.", "But all of these things ultimately are aimed at the same thing which is on one hand, how do you maximize performance and minimize power in other words, the attributes that differentiate a chip. And on the other hand, how do you get the best productivity and predictability out of the whole flow.", "And that frankly impact the economics. And we're seeing that by integrating well a number of the backend stuffs, we can have major impact on the turnaround time in the fab and that of course has very positive impact on their customers.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then just finally will future analog revenues obviously they will be small to begin with, but will that be encapsulated in your core EDA revenue bucket or will you make as a new bucket for that one?", "Aart De Geus", "No, you're right. They will be in the core EDA and we've said all along that we consider it's both an opportunity to grow in a sub segment that we were not in before. But just as importantly it's a result, what I consider a critical strategic hold that we've for long, long time that allows us now to be much more competitive in our market overall. And simultaneously go to customers and provide them truly full solution.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Aart De Geus", "You're welcome Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "", "Thank you. Good evening. Last week at the EDC DO forum I think a projection was put forth for EDA growth in 2008 of 2%. And I know you didn't give create that forecast, but just wondering where you stand relative to that forecast if you're willing to sort of comment on how you see EDA growth this year?", "Brian Beattie", "You are correct. I did not want to come forth with a prediction for EDA because we've obviously seen that the impact of revenue models has the great impact of how you make these forecast and we can stand behind a very solid and visible forecast of 7.5% to 8.5% for this year for us because we actually mostly know what is going to be, and that is a very different situation than if you are a company that is much more dependent of the ups and downs of having a front or if you have a very different revenue recognition model. And so having been there many years ago I know how difficult it is to predict your future and therefore, we are very cautious with predicting EDA. Overall I think the healthy market then it will continue to grow somewhat at least.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "I guess we thinking of it more in terms of bookings growth, rather than understanding some revenue model changes will clearly put some pressure on the industry revenue, but do you see the industry growing and sort of a booking basis or however you want to look at it sort of factoring out the obvious revenue compression from that model shift?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, if I may send the note of caution how people over interpret bookings, you obviously can greatly mislead yourself and others depending on the length of the deals that you make. And then think of it as booking growth when in reality it is essentially taking out years.", "And so we have been very careful with that as well, having learned from the past and so booking's growth is actually a very tricky indicator. I understand that there is some value to that our own sense is that we continually watch the run rate growth with our customers and that is internally absolutely the single thing that we pay most attention to because that is pretty decent predictor of future revenue growth.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "And I'd like just to follow-up on that, one last point. Would you feel comfortable, it sounds like you're planning certainly to be building your run rate throughout this year and as you enter into fiscal '09 that you will have a higher run rate in fiscal '09. Is that a fair statement?", "Aart de Geus", "That's a very fair statement. That is absolutely what we are, not only planning, but managing the company towards.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Great and just one quick one for you, Brian, I missed the actual number of shares you bought back this quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "We bought back 3.4 million shares for $83 million in the first quarter overall.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Great, that is very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Yeah, thanks. Can I actually get clarification on the last kind of, Aart you said that you're managing the business to be at a higher run rate next year, meaning you expect faster revenue growth next year, what -- I didn't understand the comment?", "Aart de Geus", "Let me clarify without say going into '09 guidance, which we do at the end of the year. What I meant to say it wasn't clear is that we are running our business with two fundamental objectives. The first one that you all know well about is to keep improving gradually the ops margin, and we do that by roughly speaking, making sure that expenses are at about half or less of the revenue growth.", "The second one is I meant to say that we expect that revenue in '09 will be larger than in '08 and in '08 we did give guidance of revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. But given that much of our focus in the bookings and the run rate with the customer is aimed at building backlog for '09 and '10. That is why I'm saying that our objective and our plan is, entirely aimed at growing the revenue of the company.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then in terms of -- you made the comment that in this type of year its execution and better technology that's going to win the day. You mentioned a large number of different areas in terms of new product introductions etcetera. But from your point of view what are the couple of real keys that are going to drive the bookings execution or the bookings with your customers this year. Is it going through the inflexion on IC Compiler or what are the two or three key areas that we should really be watching as the year unfold?", "Aart de Geus", "Actually, I think that all, the product advances, which we've many. Many are very much focused on speed, capacity etcetera all have one fundamental objective at this point and time, which is the productivity and the success rate of our customers. And unfortunately the word productivity is a much more nebulous term for which there is not a very sharp definition or easy set of metrics. But is the set of measures that has the biggest economic impacts on our customers.", "And so I expect that a lot of the growth will come from customers that gradually say hey, I want to go much more with Synopsys because there is a much better chance of getting my chips out on time with the performance and the power characteristics that I'm looking for. Now on the margin, obviously, there are some areas that may grow a little bit faster than others. But from a big picture point of view that is really how we're managing the company.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "And then last question to Brain. In terms of the sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, how much of the variation versus last quarter should we think about in terms of some of the variable expenses like commissions related to bookings in the quarter and how of it is other factors and including seasonality?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah. I'm just comparing here in terms of the expenses Q4 to Q1 of '08 came down about $7 million. So, primarily that's related to shifting out of some of our expenses in terms of bringing on new headcount. It did not happen in the quarter. We also retained on some of the travel expenses for the quarter. Some of the contractor usage all that was light and as a result we're able to come in less than our plan and really drive up that margin number for the quarter.", "So, a lot of that is shifted out relative to any headcount relatively we got factored in from sales or marketing and of course as you know there is a proportionate allocation of commission expense to the level of activity as it comes in. So, it's all lined up in our guidance for the year or so where we expected to come in.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We've a question from line of Tim Fox with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, just a couple of questions around DFM, you mentioned the focus there was around growth of the segment as well as differentiation of your flows utilizing some of the DFM technology. I was just curious more so around the growth and the fact that in many cases you're selling different value proportion to the fab then you maybe to the designer themselves. I'm wondering, how do you actually get the value of all these new TCAT/Yield/Litho technologies. How do you actually get the value out of the customer if you are selling to different people and are you considering any different kind of licensing models to actually extract that value that you're rolling into your flows?", "Aart de Geus", "It's a very good question because there is no question that it's sort of almost like building a bridge on two sides of the river. And in many ways the ultimate value is how well, can you help both set of customers get the chip through with high yield. Don't forget that on the foundry side, if you don't have yield, you don't get any money either. And of course if you don't do good job on the design side, you are essentially dead and so our job is to sort of build that bridge more and more and initially we definitely sold very independently on both sides of it.", "Increasingly now, we are going to see that the learning's of the manufacturing side get translated directly into our tools and some of those can be recently upstream such as directly into the place en route, in order to minimize some of the yield issues or make it more manufacturable and my suspicion is that as number of customers become less and less involve themselves in manufacturing that they will almost use us as a substitute to help them guarantee the quality of that bridge and so I view it as much as an area of opportunity to grow as well as an investment area that solidifies the entire rest of our offering.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Okay that's helpful. And then on the other end of the design spectrum in around systems you mentioned virtual platforms starting to add a little bit more meaningfully to the business just one and if you can characterize, who is buying the virtual platforms, is that a market that you see as reasonable size growth over time or just more a niche that will fill some gap in the system level design area?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. I think the jury is out, but the promise is interesting and just to clarify for those that may not be familiar what this is, what virtual prototyping is, is a capability to build a model of chip in electronic system before that system or chip is available. And using that model you can now start developing and checking out the software is going to run on them. Well as you can imagine with many, many product the software content is becoming very, very large as a matter of fact becoming increasingly one of the key bottlenecks.", "And so if you can start earlier with that you have a big benefit. So, why is that not a slam dunk? Well, it is not a slam dunk because you actually need to develop the model that is something that requires some skill, and you need to have a strategy whereby your chips are going to be used in multiple situations.", "So, that the models are usable and we are starting to see now both of the people providing the chips, as well as interestingly our new buyers coming from the system side. Those that are going to use the chips and I expect that the virtual prototyping or variations on it increasingly are going to become almost a little bit the hand-off or the spec between those two parties. And so from that perspective, the last few quarters have been actually pretty positive.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Very good, thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Yeah, thanks. Brian, coming back to the third quarter last year you still kind of given off the model beginning at the quarter backlog that would flow into revenue over the next four quarters. Is that still a metric that you can give us?", "Brian Beattie", "We are giving a lot visibility through are knowing that we entered the year with more than 80% of 2008 revenues in hand, with entering each quarter with more than 90% of the quarter booked and again we reconfirmed that top line revenue guidance.", "So, given that one quarter through with very strong performance, you obviously concede that we've got a lot higher visibility going in. So, we are finding that the quarterly variations relative to the bookings as we did see last year can not be that significant to the business. So not really indicative of the level of activity, just due to the rotating nature and timing of when the contracts get renewed.", "So, again we continue to focus on the total year deliverables and continue to provide very good visibility in each quarter.", "And then as you know we give the actual backlog number at the end of the quarter, which in turn provides the level of booking activity. And again we'll give total year guidance at the end of 2008 relative to 2009. And I'd add as well to the metrics about this ongoing focus on multiyear business deliverables is that, that is built in again to compensation levels in the company. So, it's not just optimizing one year but a multiyear agreement, multiyear commitment with customers and multiyear return for investors.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "And one other question, in terms of with Cadence and their EDA Card been out there for a little bit now. Are any customers coming to you and asking for different types of structures or different types of arrangements that gives them additional flexibility to takedown more seats on a temporary basis to kind of mere that and if so, how you're handling it?", "Aart de Geus", "Well customers have always asked for more flexibility and at times we joke that the word flexibility just means lower pricing. Now, there are mechanisms for that. We've quite a number of models that allow people to take up more software under the right circumstances. We should not be confused with how one actually recognizes revenue, which is a whole different story. And there we should be very clear that our model remains one of well over 90% is ratable and so that's a whole different aspect of how all of these mechanism work.", "Having said that, there is no question that we should work with the customers to optimize the impact of our software on their success because at the end of the day is those sort of the customers that are more successful with our software will be a returning customers.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "All right, thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.", "Aart De Geus", "Well, at this time, I'd like to thank you for the time you spent with us. I think we had a very good quarter and we well launched into the year. And as usual Brian and I are available after the call. Have a good afternoon.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentleman this conference will be available for replay from 4:00 p.m. tonight through March the 5th midnight.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) F2Q08 Earnings Call May 21, 2008  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Lisa L. Ewbank \u2013 Vice President of Investor Relations", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Brian M. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Welcome to the Synopsys, Inc. earnings conference call for the second quarter fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would now like to turn the call over to Lisa Eubanks, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Lisa L. Ewbank", "With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys, and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. ", "During the course of this conference call may make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company\u2019s actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and in our earnings release for the second quarter issued earlier today. ", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "I am happy to report a very full quarter for Synopsys. The revenue came in at $325 million, at the high end of our guidance range while maintaining our uniquely predictable business model with over 90% time-based license revenue. We are expansive within our guidance range and delivered above-target non-GAAP earnings growth of 17%, or $0.41 per share.", "We completed the acquisition of Synplicity, a strong technology leader in FPGA designs and hardware-based rapid prototyping. We feel this strengthens our product offerings yielding very strong business levels that support our growth expectations for 2008 and 2009. And we are raising revenue and earnings guidance for the rest of this year.", "As may of you have asked us why we are seeing a better environment than our competitors, let me address for a moment the customer landscape.", "Fundamentally, things have not changed much from last quarter. The overall economy has been soft bringing some uncertainty to the semiconductor industry. On the positive side, even if mitigated a bit by continued AFP pressure, demand for electronics continues to grow. The main profitability [inaudible] areas are in the memory market, where a number of companies battle for share based on price and capacity. For the rest of the semiconductor industry, we see a number of innovations actions aimed at giving companies larger share and increased competitiveness in market sub-segments. A clear example of this trend is the recently announced wireless joint venture between SC and XB. ", "For Synopsys, there is little change in our customers\u2019 behavior, including timing and closure rates of contracts. And although we have seen some aggressive pricing attempts by competitors trying to make their quarter-end numbers, Synopsys has fared well. In this environment customers are searching for optimal EDA partners and closer collaboration. Our leading technology, comprehensive solutions, conservative business model, and strong field support make us a preferred candidate for broader and closer relationships. ", "Indeed, just this week we announced that yet another leading semiconductor company, Matsushita, maker of the Panasonic brand, has selected Synopsys to be the primary EDA supplier. Their decision is supported by an expanded license and collaboration spanning design, digital AMF verification and manufacturing. This agreement indicates a further step towards delivering better productivity through more integrated solutions to our top customers.", "In summary, companies are understandably cautious in their spending. However, Synopsys is executing well and we continue to grow our business run rate. A key benefit of our ratable business model is its enhanced predictability, which means that we\u2019re already well into the planning of 2009 and 2010. ", "While we will provide 2009 guidance after our fourth quarter I want to respond to your requests with some preliminary thoughts on next year. Based on our business currently running ahead of plan, the closure of the Synplicity acquisition, what we see out of a healthy pipeline of opportunities and steady organic growth, our objective for 2009 is to reach double-digit revenue growth again. In addition, we plan on continued operating margin expansion, supporting double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth in 2009. ", "With that backdrop, let me provide some product and technology highlights for the quarter. Across the board we\u2019re doing well and feel momentum in many accounts. This momentum was visible at our Western U.S. User Group meeting in March with record attendance of over 2,000 engineers. The program highlighted a complete solution from system to manufacturing. As a result we saw a substantial increase in FND from system companies and foundries. Sessions on low power were the hottest, no pun intended, and was standing room only for our IP and manufacturing sessions.", "One of the particularly well received perspectives has been the progress we\u2019re making in use of multi-core multi-thread computation in our product. These new capabilities result in substantial speed-ups, such as a 2x performance booth and extraction, using dual cores. In our mixed signal verification we delivers 3x performance improvements to HSPICE on a single CPU and a further 2x on four cores.", "We also pioneered a novel capability for concurrent mass physicists and mass data processing shaving off significant time in this crucial pre-manufacturing step.", "Also in Q2 we launched Eclypse, our low power solution. Eclypse is a comprehensive suite of system level verification and its limitation technology together with IP, methodologies, and services. Built around UPF, the industry-standard unified power format, it is designed to make adoption of advanced low power techniques easier for both advanced- and broader-market customers.", "In core EDA, both our digital and analog mixed signal solutions did very well. In Synopsys we introduced design copower graphical a great new extension to design copower that predicts and reduces downstream congestion in place and route. Customer feedback is excellent. They are reporting that congestion avoidance significantly improves design and productivity and scheduled predictability.", "In physical design we are seeing a number of customers coming to Synopsys after having experienced challenges with insufficient or immature capabilities from others. In addition, we will soon introduce a brand new router, developed from the ground up that supports multi-core computation. At beta availability today, it significantly improves speed and quality of routing, while factoring very tough manufacturing challenges. Stay tuned for more details.", "We are also seeing good progress on the analog mixed signal side. FT Microelectronics recently adopted our XA capability which combines SPICE accuracy with the speed of Fast5 for its advanced marked power technologies.", "Additionally we announced the results of our collaboration with TFMC around a new modeling methodology for their 40-nanometer process that improves AMF stimulation while reducing memory use.", "Our new custom design solution is on track for introduction later this year. It is already getting very positive feedback from our initial beta partners and sneak previews of the technology at our launch user group meeting in San Jose and Israel generated a great deal of interest.", "Now let me turn to our adjacency systems and manufacturing, each group representing about 10% of our revenue. Looking at our entire product portfolio, IP is the one area this quarter that saw some short-term choppiness. This correlates with light results reported by other players in the IP space as well. We remain confident, however, in the importance and impact of this area and are continuing to invest in broadening our offering. Specifically we delivered the industry\u2019s first certified USB 2.05, or mixed signal core, for 45-nanometer processes. The small area and low power consumption make this core ideal for high volume, mobile, and consumer applications.", "IP continues to be a hot topic for semiconductor companies. Many of them are adopting commercially available IP while focusing their own development R&D on truly different shading IP blocks. iSilicons for example, which designs chips for communication networks and digital media selected Synopsys as its IP vendor of choice for protocols including USB, PCI express, and DVR.", "We also completed virtual platform projects aimed at embedded software development for two major customers in the computing and consumer electronics demand. ", "In manufacturing, both our mask and TCAB solutions showed very good progress. In the mask area Proteus OPC was selected by two important customers. One large consumer electronics company chose us not only for their very advance 32 nanometer process but also to replace the incumbent of previous process nodes. After substantial competitive evaluation the other, a global leader in storage solutions, also chose Proteus.", "In TCAB, Toshiba adopted Venturas for simulating manufacturing process such as etching to optimize complex device structures. As a result Toshiba is able to develop technologies faster, reduce costs, and improve yields.", "Another interesting note is that for many emerging solar cell start-ups Synopsys\u2019 TCAB is a promising optimization solution in the global quest for green power.", "Finally, last week we closed our acquisition of Synplicity, which is very promising from at least four angles. One, we are being joined by a very capable technical team. Two, Synplicity is a clear leader in the directly adjacent FPGA design area. Three, Synplicity brings an opportunity to cross sell products to each other\u2019s customer base. And last but certainly not least, Synplicity\u2019s growing rapid prototyping business will allow us to put increased emphasis on the embedded software market segment.", "We plan to rapidly integrate the company around the same operating margin as Synopsys.  Synplicity will thus contribute positively to our EPS growth next year while simultaneously becoming central to our strategic systems thrust going forward.", "In summary, Synopsys has momentum and expects continued strong financial execution for three key reasons. Our broad product portfolio and critical mass are enabling customers to focus on fewer, more leveraged vendor relationships. This year Synopsys will see the continuous roll out of compelling technology and exciting new products. And finally, our focus on EPS growth through expense management, revenue growth, and a uniquely predictable business model makes Synopsys a long-term, competitive, and stable partner.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance, including the financial impact of our recent Synplicity acquisition. As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "Synopsys delivered solid second quarter results highlighted by very strong business levels, double-digit revenues and non-GAAP earnings growth and continued operating margin expansion. In addition, we repurchased $87 million worth of Synopsys shares and exited the quarter with more $800 million in cash, which of course is prior to the Synplicity acquisition that closed just last week.", "Now let me provide some additional details on our financials. Total revenue increased 11%, to $324.6 million, at the high end of our target range with particular strength in Japan. From a product perspective, we continue to see broad-based demand for our solutions, our Galaxy design and discovery verification solutions, which make up our core EDA platform, each delivered revenue growth in a double-digit range during the quarter. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of our second quarter revenue.", "Turning to expenses, we remain focused on cost and expense management. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $249.7 million and expected sequential increase due to the timing of quarterly expenses, including variable compensation and some hiring that shifted out of Q1 into Q2. For the quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 23.1% and we\u2019re well on track to achieving our target operating margin for the year of 23%. We remain committed to driving to the mid- to high-20s in the coming years as we continue to focus on profitable revenue growth.", "Turning now to earnings GAAP earnings per share were $0.27 with cost and expenses totaling $275 million. This included $12.4 million of amortization of intangible assets and $17.8 million of share-based compensation. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 17% to $0.41, exceeding our target range. We achieved these strong results while continuing to make disciplined investments that position us very well to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see for Synopsys.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 26% and came in at the low end of our guidance range. For the entire year we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, which does not assume renewal of the R&D tax credit in the United States.", "Given our predictable business model, revenue visibility remains strong and we continue to execute well on contract mix. Up front revenue was 4% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%.  And as expected, greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog.", "Our ability to consistently deliver solid financial results illustrates the power of our highly time-based business model. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was again approximately three years.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Cash and short-term investments increased $50 million year-over-year to $817 million, which again is prior to the Synplicity acquisition. We generated $35 million in cash from operations during the quarter. We expect higher cash generation in the second half of our fiscal year, partially driven by the expected annual payment from a large customer in the third quarter.", "We continue to target 2008 operating cash flow of approximately $325 million with free cash flow generation of $280 million. I would also like to comment that our cash balance is not exposed to auction rate securities and we are pleased with the high quality and conservative risk profile of our investment portfolio.", "We purchased 3.8 million shares of Synopsys stock for $87 million and have approximately $260 million remaining on our current authorization. Diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 145 million.", "Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $172 million and we maintained industry-leading DSOs of 48 days, reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio and the timing of invoices.  Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $587 million and ended Q2 with approximately 5,300 employees.", "As Aart highlighted, we are excited to have closed the acquisition of Synplicity last week. It was an all cash deal, valued at approximately $181 million, net of cash acquired. We expect the transaction to be slightly dilutive to our non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2008 and accretive in fiscal 2009.", "Although we\u2019re still early in the planning process, I wanted to provide you with some preliminary thoughts underlying our FY2009 goals of reaching double-digit revenues and EPS growth, along with operating margin expansion.", "Traditionally the way we think about our business is to limit expense growth to about half of revenue growth. Now as you model 2009, at this point, we believe that ratio would temporarily be in the 70%-75% range due to the near term revenue transition and integration of Synplicity. ", "Before I provide our third quarter and fiscal 2008 guidance, let me make some general comments. Our targets reflect an increase in our base Synopsys revenue and EPS guidance and also the addition of Synplicity. We expect Synplicity revenue to be modest in Q3 and slightly higher in Q4, primarily reflecting the purchase accounting haircut that was applied to deferred revenue. ", "Given the highly complimentary nature of the two companies\u2019 products, our goal over time is to realize revenue synergies, including cross sell opportunities into the combined installed base. We also believe there are opportunities for expense synergies over time, such as IT integration and typical G&A efficiencies. Now, please keep in mind that we closed the transaction only a week ago so these assumptions may change as we complete the valuation work and the integration efforts.", "It\u2019s also important to note that to ensure minimum impact on customers; we have kept both their development and sales organizations virtually intact. Finally, even with the slight dilutive effect from the acquisition in 2008, we reiterate our original operating margin target of 23%.", "Now moving on to guidance. For the third quarter of FY2008 our targets are: revenue between $335 million to $343 million; total GAAP cost and expenses between $290 million to $308 million, which includes approximately $17 million of share-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $260 million to $270 million; other income and expense between $0.0 million to $3 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 26% to 27%; outstanding shares between 143 million to 148 million; GAAP earnings of $0.18 to $0.24 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2008 outlook. We are raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.325 billion to $1.340 billion, a growth rate of approximately 9.5% to 10.5%. At this time we anticipate that Synplicity will contribute approximate $20 million to $23 million in revenue. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%. Outstanding shares between 146 million to 149 million. GAAP earnings per share between $0.99 to $1.11, which includes the impact of approximately $65 million in share-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earning per share of $1.60 to $1.64. We\u2019ve increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.04 and the top end by $0.03, even taking into account the $0.02 to $0.03 dilution we expect from Synplicity. Cash flow from operations of approximately $325 million and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re targeting a 23% non-GAAP operating margin for the full year. ", "As a reminder, our guidance excludes Synplicity operating revenues and expenses through May 14, as the acquisition closed on May 15.", "In summary, we once again demonstrated solid financial execution. We\u2019re performing well against our strategy while delivering top and bottom line growth. Our results illustrate continued momentum in our business and our proven ability to execute in a competitive environment.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Raj Seth - Cowen & Company.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Brian, you said $20 million to $23 million from Synplicity. Is most of that just purchase accounting or, they were running what, $17 million a quarter or something, or are you having to change the revenue recognition itself to get to your model? What\u2019s going on there?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It\u2019s clearly the haircut you get in purchase accounting related to the deferred revenues. And again, it\u2019s a public company, you can see the amount of deferred revenues they had at the end of their first quarter, and to that it\u2019s a very large haircut, based on purchase accounting rules. Somewhere in the 90% range of that is lost, so you basically start over again on the revenue basis.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Right. And what kind of model were they running? Do you have to shut their model at all or not really?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Not really. It\u2019s about 60% up front, about 40% ratable and, again, as we look at how we integrate those transactions with ours, it will be in that range we anticipate. But it may swing around again, based on how we do the transitions. But that\u2019s the number we\u2019ve built in for now.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Aart, I think you may have mentioned implicitly in your comments, but from a bookings perspective, are bookings on plan, above plan? How have bookings been trending in this environment which you acknowledge at the edge is probably a little bit more uncertain than it has been?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Overall they are a bit above plan. I mentioned the fact that we felt that our business was a bit stronger than what we had planned for. I\u2019m always fairly relaxed about the quarter-to-quarter situation but, in general, this year is unfolding quite well for us. And that gave us additional confidence that integrated with the forward-looking model that we have, we could already make some very good comments for 2009.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "You mentioned progress in the multi-core multi-thread applications you have coming. I\u2019m just curious, at Nvedia\u2019s last analyst meeting, they\u2019ve been pushing very fine-grain GPU architectures in a number of applications and there were actually a couple of EDA startups talking about really big speed ups using these kinds of architectures.", "I\u2019m just curious what thoughts you have about how real or not real that is? Is that something you can do? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.", "Aart J. de Geus", "We actually have in-house a centralized effort to look at a broad set of architectures because many of these things are promising but they\u2019re also fairly immature and there\u2019s going to be a broad swap from essentially duplication of the standard processor cores, all the way to extremely fine grained a la NVIDIA, or [inaudible] certain type of that transaction.", "And so we are engaged with NVIDIA, we are engaged with a number of others and it depends a little bit on which products, what is the most common thing, and it also depends a little bit on how supportable will this be going forward.", "So I think we are at the beginning of a very exciting age which is the whole age of computing is changing. And that will open up doors for us. And having seen this coming we did focus the entire company to make sure that all our products have plans. As a matter of fact, starting last year and a lot this year, we are now rolling out practical implementation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Valera - Needham & Company.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Aart, can you say if that assumes backlog, year-over-year backlog growth, heading into fiscal 2009? I assume it would but I just wanted to confirm that.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we actually give out the backlog at the end of the year, so actually did not make any statements on backlog, which should neither be read as positive or negative. It\u2019s just that we want to stick to that rule. Largely because we want to stay away from giving fine-grain detail on the bookings as we don\u2019t want to be back in the situation of having to negotiate at the end of the quarter with customers on what they hear via Wall Street.", "Having said that, clearly  our backlog is one of the key assets that over time in aggregate tends to keep growing as we want to enter the next year complicitly with about 80% of revenue in hand. The next quarter is 90% in hand. And all in all we\u2019re well on track with that.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Brian, can you say, will the affect of the loss of deferred revenue at Synplicity be largely over in 12 months? Is most of that a 12-month duration?", "Brian M. Beattie", "That\u2019s right. It\u2019s over a 12-month duration. So the rest of this year and a little bit into 2009.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Then we should see the full, natural run rate of Synplicity in the second half of next year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes. That\u2019s right.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "And with respect to the Matsushita consolidation deal that you just announced, I would assume, but you didn\u2019t really want to, that you\u2019ve increased your run rate there? Is that a safe assumption, Aart?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Actually, I think I indirectly said exactly that. Yes. Not only did we increase the run rate but we also broadened the product portfolio utilization. ", "And Matsushita is an outstanding company. Many of you may remember that they were actually the first one that announced production 45-nanometer chip, which probably we were involved in. And so they have been a very good technology driver partner/user for a number of years and having them be in the category of preferred vendors for us is really terrific.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Did that booking happen after the end of the quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No. It\u2019s in Q2.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - JP Morgan.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "Brian, you gave us the inclusion of Synplicity for this year but as you get the deferred revenue write down back, what should we think about the inclusion for 2009?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, again, at this point, we\u2019ve provided some very preliminary views on 2009 and that performance from Synplicity, as you heard both with partial haircut in the first part of the year and then full run rate in the second half, combined with run rate is where we anticipate reaching the double-digit revenue growth again for next year. So we\u2019ve built that in. And of course, we just closed the deal last week, so as we complete both the integration work, really understand the full detail of all of the license transitions that we go through, the amount of outstanding deferred and so to go through in our valuation work, we will be able to give you more detail and we anticipate doing that at the end of the year.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "And this was the second quarter that deferred revenue actually declined sequentially. Can you give us an update on how we should think about that?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, absolutely. Again, as everyone understands, deferred revenue only includes what we\u2019ve invoiced but have not yet taken into the revenues in the quarter. And again, it will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of the contracts and the invoices. Now, in Q3 we expect our deferred revenues should again increase. Because of our annual in-advance payment from our most significant customer. That, if you recall, shifted from Q1 renewal date to a Q3 contract term. So each Q3 we would anticipate deferred revenues going up and we anticipate seeing that in this third quarter.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "And then on the cash flow, I believe that the last couple of quarters you actually talked about cash flow for the year being greater than $325 million and now you\u2019re talking about it being approximately $325 million. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just nit-picking, but is there something that you\u2019re looking at a little bit differently in terms of cash flow generation for the year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No, we\u2019re really close to that original number. We\u2019re saying about $325 million, which again, we view as being for the year. And it\u2019s just actually now getting through the integration of a pretty significant acquisition to really understand the full cash flow impact. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of room to maneuver. So we\u2019re still committed on that $325 million level, for the year, which is a real strong cash flow from the operations.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "Can you describe for us the current year FX impact on revenue and expenses and what you\u2019ve included in your outlook?", "Brian M. Beattie", "From a revenue perspective, the company is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, except for our Japanese business. So on a revenue perspective you don\u2019t see any significant impact. And even from the expense side of things, based on our hedging plans and the coverage that we provided ourselves, we see no material impact on expenses or EPS for the year. So we\u2019re locked in for the year and do not anticipate any deterioration based on movement in the U.S. dollar.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen - Citigroup.", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "My question relates to the outlook for 2009 for operating expenses to grow above the expectation of half of revenue growth. Brian, I think you mentioned 70% to 80% of revenue growth, is that correct?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes. 50% to 75% which we see as a temporary impact, primarily related to the acquisition, right? The revenue growth is slower than the regular run rate was for that business for that business but the expenses you get immediately on day one. So again, recognize both the haircut on the revenue side, and again, as we integrate the models with ours, that\u2019s how we help you in terms of planning the operating of the financial models, as we look forward. So just to give you an awareness that we see that ratio temporarily increasing for 2009.", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "And would that have been the regular below half of revenue growth, without the Synplicity acquisition?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It\u2019s about that rate, that\u2019s right. As we have been modeling out the year, given the visibility we have and our own target. And again, we remain committed to that operating margin expansion that you\u2019ve seen us on for the past few years. We have about 300 basis point improvement in operating margin this year, and again forecast expanded operating margins again for 2009, and then ultimately reaching that mid- to high 20s over the next two years. ", "So, you can see us both managing that expenses in line with the anticipated revenue growth, which has relatively high predictability to both sides of that equation.", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "Related to the cash flow impact of Synplicity for this year. You maintained your $325 million guidance for fiscal 2008, before and after the acquisition. What\u2019s the net cash flow effect of that acquisition?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, the net cost of the acquisition is $181 million, net of the cash incurred as the transaction happens. And then relative to the impact on 2008 from the Synplicity business unit as it stands, we really do not anticipate any deterioration of our cash flow. It\u2019s about a wash for this year as we look at both the revenue projections, collections, and expense run rate that we\u2019ll see.", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "Aart, it seems like this marks the fourth major account consolidation in about as many quarters. While looking at the competitors we haven\u2019t the same level of account traction. What, speaking for yourself, what do you attribute this string of customer traction and customer [inaudible] that you\u2019ve alluded to? Is it technology position? Is it a benefit of having gone to the subscription model? Is it the current economic environment at customers? Could you maybe add some detail there?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. I think there are two of the three that you mentioned that are most important. Technology advantage and economic model. The technology advantage is increasingly clear as you move to smaller geometries and dramatically more complex chips. And in very simple terms, if you glue together even best-in-class tools you increasingly get worst-in-class results. And so a more and more integrated flow is an absolute necessity to finish the chips and finish them on schedule. And so from that perspective there\u2019s a big advantage of teaming up with somebody you can trust for that.", "I would add to that technical angle that the very support model is also important, meaning that we have very strong fields teams that are now increasingly involved in the finishing of chips with our customers and it\u2019s just a substantial risk reduction mechanism for them.", "Now, on the other side of the equation it is very clear that the semiconductor industry, overall, is looking for efficiency and you can see that on how they structure their businesses more towards a focus on certain market segments. Well, that famous efficiency can be driven by being much less haphazard on how they spend their money on a variety of tools. And so, simply put, they get much more bang for their buck by teaming up and so we have had the economy pushing us but the technology is really the justification.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Aart, I would like to explore the Synplicity transaction with the following question. Do you regard Synplicity as being more than a medium size or routine technology filler acquisition and perhaps something more impactful, and if so, does it have a natural opportunity to be a nine-figure business for you where, even after 14 years and it\u2019s own acquisitions it really wasn\u2019t much more than a mid-eight figure business. Is there a significant subtle tens of millions of dollar up side opportunity here from what you\u2019re getting there?", "Secondly, Brian, could you elaborate on the Japan up side in the quarter. It was an unusually large increase which was not correlated to any sequential change in your upfront revenues so there must have been some larger amounts, some non-linearity coming out of backlog related to your Japan business, it would seem.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay, Jay, first to the Synplicity situation. Simply put, the answer is absolutely yes. I mean that. I see multiple opportunities coming with Synplicity. Let me start with the obvious one, which is, they are in a market segment that is completely adjacent, FPGA. And in all fairness has been somewhat stodgy over the last few years. However, if you look at FPGAs you can see that they are very rapidly adopting the most advanced design nodes, while a number of the designs are languishing behind the older nodes. ", "That\u2019s another way of saying that FPGAs could well become more attractive for a set of customers, and they become even more attractive if you add to the FPGAs the Synopsys IP position and some of our verification tools. So that\u2019s one reason.", "The second reason and I think that\u2019s one that ultimately ties even more to your comment, is the fact that Synplicity has built a very interesting rapid prototyping verification business. And it is very interesting because it touches this interaction between hardware and software and we have felt for quite a while that over time the embedded software was going to become more and more of a nightmare from a productivity and predictability point of view. And that if we can add some value there, we should be able to build that business.", "And so, as Brian said, we just closed the transaction a few days ago. And so the time line is still quite a bit open, but fundamentally I support all of your comments whole-heartedly.", "Brian M. Beattie", "And maybe I\u2019ll pick up your second point, Jay, on the Japanese business. It was extremely strong in the second quarter for us. And we named some of the wins in the quarter so far, but it was extremely strong for us. ", "The other advantage we had with that is both the annual fiscal years, for most Japanese companies, ends in February. So we were able to close many of the deals in Japan earlier than towards the end of the quarter, therefore, with our ratable revenue model we were able to get almost three full months of revenue from that. So that really helped our business pick up.", "And secondly, when you look back at the business of Japan, our trailing four-quarter revenue is about a 10% run rate. So, again, that\u2019s in line with our overall revenue growth. But, again, Q2 is the big year end and great results that were put up.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Just a shorter-term question. First, could you comment at all on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of unscheduled or termed business? If there is anything meaningful going on there and we often speak about platform or multi-product deals, but are you seeing any changes at all in demand for large singe-product deals? Anything of that kind?", "Aart J. de Geus", "We\u2019re looking at each slightly puzzled because I think fundamentally there\u2019s nothing that stands out from that perspective. On the other hand, there\u2019s no question that the notion of platform is becoming more and more important from my earlier comment which is that integrated complete solutions is what customers are looking for. So you can call it platform, you can also call it just more comprehensive transactions. But we are definitely growing on the basis of customers saying the overall offering of Synopsys stands out well.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "You mentioned a new router. Could you help us understand how you foresee the adoption or migration of that, particularly in the context of earlier router initiatives from 6-8 years ago?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we have not formally introduced the product yet so I want to be a little cautious about exactly how we position it in the context of our products. But clearly I think we have been able to continue a strong push of XG evolution in the last few years. And one is I think in addition to that is that we are using multi-core. Now, much more routinely I would say. ", "The fact that the router is already in beta, the results are excellent. But as a matter of fact even one of our customers decided to use it for production. So, they have a high degree of confidence. I believe it may even be mentioned in the Matsushita press release. So this thing is well on track.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Aart, could you comment a little bit about what\u2019s going on in your DSM part of the business. And specifically, it looks like you have really been trying to build out your tool set around the TCAB product offering. Are you relying less on the assets you acquired from HPL on the test chip methodology for DSM?", "Aart J. de Geus", "All of your comments are correct. We are clearly focusing on those areas in the DSM, or manufacturing side that have been most successful. And the TCABs offering is of increasingly broad interest at a number of places. In the development of new technologies, in the development of new [inaudible] modules, transistors, and the manufacturing itself and then I think some of the cool applications, literally, are clearly those things that new materials use for solar cells, power devices, illuminations, and things like that. So I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of creativity in the world and on these topics and our capability I think will be central to developing that.", "On the test chip side, we have focused mostly on the yield management aspect that we got from HPL as being the one that is more rewarding for us. But so we continue to tune the operating a little bit as a function of where we see traction.", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Brian, I think you mentioned that you bought back $87 million of Synopsys shares this quarter. How many actual shares did you buy back or what was the average price?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Year to date we\u2019ve repurchased 7.2 million for $170 million. I think that\u2019s averaging at about a $24.00 range. Just averaging it out. That\u2019s again, more than we did all of last year, as well, at this same point in town. I think the average price in the second quarter was about $23.00 and it was 3.8 million shares.", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Brian, another caller asked about the change in deferred and I understand in general that it\u2019s going to decline in certain quarters, but I\u2019m more interested in the more graphic change in the long term deferred and what I should be reading into that.", "Brian M. Beattie", "You\u2019re saying from the perspective of Synplicity\u2019s deferred revenues?", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 D. A. Davidson & Co.", "No. The long-term portion of your deferred revenues. Fell from $80 million to $65 million, so it was down $14 million, whereas just the traditional deferred, it was down less.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Right. Your up front deferred over the next year is in the short term and beyond one year is there. So really what happens is your contracts that mature, they roll into the next short-term perspective. So, I feel like that\u2019s the one that you watch the most. And again, the movement between the two accounts, in general, for all of deferred revenues is really not that material. As I say, it\u2019s really based on the timing of the annual renewals for these contracts and, as I say, that combined number is going to go up pretty significantly in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "What would you say one can expect to be the incremental revenue [inaudible] $70 million dollar run rate?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Maybe going a little bit sideways onto Jay\u2019s comments and question. Already next year, the contribution of Synplicity and Synopsys will be fully integrated and so we do not plan at all to follow that company in that fashion. So from an incremental point of view it\u2019s going to be a little bit difficult to say. We have clearly said that we will be delivering double-digit revenue at least that is our plan for next year.", "What is clear, though, is that we want to rethink how to look at Synplicity from the perspective of can we cross sell between our respective customer bases, how can we take advantage of the new position in FPGA with some of our other products, and most interestingly, what can we do to accelerate the system side of that business.", "So I think we\u2019re surrounded by opportunities and how we will prioritize them is a function of precisely the planning that has started about this week.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Could you give some broad outline on what are some of the specific incremental products that you are focusing on?", "Aart J. de Geus", "You mean from Synplicity?", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, they fundamentally have two major product lines. One is the product line that is addressing the synthesis in the creation of FPGAs. And therefore be head toward [inaudible] Excel as their main silicone partners. And so there are a lot of opportunities to broaden that relationship because Synopsys also has a strong collection of IP blocks and as the FPGAs become more complex a number of these IP blocks could reside very well on FPGAs. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. ", "The other key product line is really the one that is aimed at helping embedded software development by creating rapid prototypes of a design before the design is actually manufactured so that the software people can start developing this. And so that\u2019s a product line called Confirm and really helps in the verification of all this. And so there, as well, I think we have a lot of opportunities to accelerate adoption because the old Synopsys field team, of course has a lot of customers that greatly benefit from these capabilities.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "In the tradition product area could you point out some specific areas where you folks are reducing the run rate?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I mentioned earlier that increasingly our customers actually tend to buy a broad collection of our tools because the tools work really well together. And so what we can see is that the run rate of our customers with the vast majority of the large deals we do, are increasing. And this has always been a high importance when you have a ratable business model because you essentially would like to increase the commitment of the customer steadily as he commits for the next three years. And the vast majority of our deals are exactly around that time frame.", "And so for this quarter and last quarter we have done particularly well in that direction and that has been one of the ingredients where we\u2019re saying that in addition to the Synplicity acquisition we have organic growth and we see that not only were we able to increase our guidance for this year but also give you a sneak preview for next year given the number of people that were worried that the market was not doing well for us. I think we\u2019re doing very well.", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Is it fair to say that were one to suppose the contribution of Synplicity to Synopsys for fiscal 2009 one would have considered a mid [inaudible].", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, clearly the addition of Synplicity improved things. We are actually tacking on pretty good growth given the overall outlook in the market and the uncertainty. We\u2019ll see exactly how much we do by the time we deliver and we\u2019ll give you much more detailed guidance at the end of the year. But fundamentally we do see a healthy situation and feel that we have quite a bit of momentum. And so we decided to share with you some of the outlook because a combination of organic growth plus Synplicity I think bodes well for Synopsys.", "And a little side note. You probably heard in our comments that we\u2019re also committed to move Synplicity rapidly to the same ops margin target as we have set for Synopsys. And that we will continue to grow the ops margin. So all in all we are sticking to our plans and I think we are delivering well.", "Aart J. de Geus", "We thank you for your attendance.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) Q3 2008 Earnings Call August 20, 2008  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "", "Lisa Ewbank \u2013 VP IR", "Aart de Geus - CEO", "Brian Beattie - CFO", "Analysts", "", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 DA Davidson", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Operator", "Welcome to the Synopsys, Inc. earnings conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. (Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Lisa Ewbank", "Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys, and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. ", "During the course of this conference call Synopsys may make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company\u2019s actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be projected. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Q for the second quarter and in our earnings release for the third quarter issued earlier today. ", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in our third quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon, I\u2019m happy to report another solid quarter for Synopsys. Revenue came in at $344 million, above our target range, with over 90% time-based license revenue. We managed expenses well, holding spending to the low end of our range and we delivered above target non-GAAP earnings growth of 37% yielding $0.44 per share.", "We are raising non-GAAP earnings guidance and expect to come in $0.08 to $0.11 higher then we anticipated at the beginning of 2008. Our technology is very strong and competitively we are clearly pulling ahead in both customer success and business execution. ", "Before moving to the quarter\u2019s highlights let me comment on the customer on EDA environment. The marketplace today is sending mixed signals. While chip volumes are increasing ASP pressure has been top of semiconductor growth. Lately though manufacturing capacity has begun to tighten up and the first half semiconductor results came in better than many expected.", "In this uncertain landscape we see some customers racing forward to gain market share while others are holding back on their forward commitments. One common theme is caution and selectivity in choosing suppliers they can count on for the future.", "While challenging for the EDA industry overall, this is positive for Synopsys being recognized as technically and financially very strong. Indeed many companies who rely on us including those who have selected Synopsys as their primary partner, are seeing superior productivity benefits and overall appear to be doing well themselves.", "Even against the backdrop of increased caution and lengthening sales cycle, Synopsys delivered strong results again and we are increasing out outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. With the 2009 market uncertainty in mind though, we are proactively outperforming on Ops margin already in 2008.", "A better 2008 finish helps us enter 2009 in a very solid position with the objective to deliver continued strong earnings even with more moderate revenue growth. Once we complete our 2009 planning we will provide detailed guidance with our next earnings report.", "Based on backlog, pipeline, recent customer interactions and the visible struggles of our competitors we are assuming a revenue growth rate of approximately 6% to 7%. With a focus on market share gains and continued Ops margin expansion; we estimate growing earnings in to the $1.70 to $1.80 range.", "If the semiconductor landscape improves all the better. Meanwhile we\u2019re making excellent competitive headway as our product differentiation is positively impacting our business. Not only did we recently announce that National Semiconductor selected us as their key EDA supplier, and is partnering with us on our new analog mixed signal design solution, we also have a number of customers seeking our help and [taping] out chips which have overwhelmed competitors tools.", "Clearly Synopsys is mission critical for their success and we are supporting them well during this time of uncertainty. That brings me to the product and technology highlights for the quarter. Technology is at the core of our differentiation and this year we\u2019re doing particularly well with our existing product portfolio and in delivering a steady stream of new capability.", "In core EDA both digital and analog mixed signal are gaining competitive strength. Starting with our digital solutions, IC Compiler is especially strong and is systematically replacing competitors\u2019 tools at a number of customers. During the Design Automation Conference in June, Intel, TI ASIC, SD, Toshiba and ARM, presented testimonials about their excellent results using IC Compiler.", "These companies are seeing significantly faster turnaround time and quality of results for their advanced high performance chips. Another example is MediaTek known for its wireless and digital media solutions, MediaTek adopted IC Compiler for its next generation 65nm design.", "Also at DAC we demonstrated our newest multi core capability to standing room only crowds. Products included PrimeTime, Design Compiler, and as a special surprise to our customers or new router, Zroute. ", "Zroute is a brand new multi threaded router developed from the ground up and integrated into IC Compiler. It has delivered a 10x increase in speed, its easy to use and its [inaudible] for manufacturing friendly results.", "It is notable that at its introduction Zroute had already completed its first production tape out attesting to its great new capabilities and robustness. We also continued to deliver enhancements throughout our low power flow including low power reference flows for the 45nm common platform process as well as for [UMCs] 65nm technology.", "One example of low power success was at Oticon the leader in development of power sensitive hearing aids. Oticon used IC Compiler\u2019s unique low power optimizations in taping out its next generation DSP chip sets. ", "Together with ARM and [inaudible] we also announced industry\u2019s first comprehensive low power verification solution. The new verification methodology captures the expertise of all three companies and enables customers to more rapidly and broadly adopt best practices for low power designs. ", "The integration of Synplicity is starting with positive momentum as well. During the quarter we introduced great new functionality in SPGA designs including new physical synthesis and significant quality of results improvements for [inaudible] SPGA devices.", "After barely three months of integration we can already confirm that Synplicity brought to Synopsys a very strong team, excellent technology and an expanded customer base. Most importantly business is right on track. ", "On the analog mixed signal side we\u2019re seeing accelerated adoption of our XA technology which combines the speed of HSPICE with the accuracy of SPICE. This quarter four new customers used XA in their production flows. ", "Let me also give you an update on our highly anticipated new custom design solution. We are perfectly on track for launch this quarter. The demos at DAC had the highest attendance and received the highest scores. Our bigger partners are quite enthusiastic about the core technologies, ease of use, and ease of adoption and robustness of the product. ", "Stay tuned for more details shortly.", "Now let me turn to our adjacencies, systems and manufacturing. In systems we had a solid quarter for the IP business and for our new ASIC rapid prototyping system. We saw continued product momentum with the release of new digital IP titles including a SATA device controller which completes that IP family.", "We also announced a major addition to our PCI express family and added TSMC 40nm and 45nm library to our design ware library portfolio. In mixes signal IP product accomplishments included the tape out of a new TSMC analog USB core and the release of new DDR capabilities.", "Demand for our [Confirma] rapid prototyping system is high as well as customers are beginning to migrate to our off the shelf solution rather then make their own costly custom boards. During the quarter we announced hardware and software enhancements including the much anticipated Identify Pro debug technology and market expanding interface applications such as PCI Express and SATA.", "In manufacturing our TCAB solutions are finding increasingly broad end markets. They are recognizing the benefits of our nanoscale simulation technology. Kodak, the world leader in image sensors adopted our TCABs to support its research and development of new products as high image resolution requires very complex simulations.", "In the Mask area we introduced a new release of Proteus which delivers key ease of use features and further flow integration enabling concurrent processing of manufacturing applications. ", "In summary Synopsys is executing very well notwithstanding the turbulent landscape around us. We see four key elements contributing to our strong outlook; excellent technology and product pipeline with visible competitive momentum, strong scalable global customer support executing well on a growing number of primary vendor collaborations, a conservative time-based business model that helps us navigate in uncertain waters while supporting investments for future growth and finally a strong and motivated team focused on growing our value to our customers. ", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Beattie, our CFO.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our 2008 guidance. As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "As Aart mentioned, Q3 financial results were solid. We delivered double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings, generated considerable operating cash flow and expanded non-GAAP operating margins, all under a consistent business model. Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials.", "Total revenue increased 13% to $344 million above our target with strength across many areas of the business. Our core EDA platform continues to perform well and achieve double-digit revenue growth for the trailing four quarters. As expected Synplicity revenue contribution was fairly modest primarily reflecting the purchase accounting haircut that\u2019s applied to the deferred revenue.", "One customer accounted for slightly more then 10% of our third quarter revenue. Turning to expenses, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $261.5 million, an expected increase due mainly to our Synplicity acquisition but at the low end of our target range due to timing of expenses and overall cost control.", "As a result non-GAAP operating margin was 24% during the quarter, an increase of more than 500 basis points. Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.39 with costs and expenses totaling $294 million. This included $11 million of amortization of our intangible assets, $17 million of share based compensation, and $4.8 million of IP R&D associated with Synplicity and a one-time $17 million GAAP only tax benefit associated with the IRS settlement that we first announced in December of 2007.", "We are pleased that we resolved this $477 million tax issue for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Now in a similar vein as part of a routine examination of 2002 to 2004 returns, the IRS recently proposed adjustments which would total approximately $250 million in additional taxes primarily associated with our acquisition of Avanti. ", "As with the previous case we filed a protest, we believe the claim is without merit and that we are fully reserved. As you know resolution of these routine issues can typically take a long time and we\u2019ll provide more details in our third quarter 10-K to be filed next month. ", "Now turning back to earnings, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 37% to $0.44 exceeding our target range. As a result of this solid execution we are raising our annual earnings guidance. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 25%, slightly below our target range. ", "For the entire year we continue to expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26% which does not assume renewal of the R&D tax credit in the United States. Given our predictable business model, revenue visibility remains strong and we continue to execute well on contract mix. ", "Upfront revenue was 6% of total, within our target range of less then 10% and as expected greater then 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was again approximately three years. ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items, cash and short-term investments totaled $877 million up $60 million sequentially even with our all cash purchase of Synplicity during the quarter. We generated $231 million in cash from operations including an expected annual payment from a large customer. ", "Capital expenditures were $7 million. We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $260 million remaining on our current authorization. And as always we\u2019ll evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter including company operations, investments and stock repurchases.", "Q3 net accounts receivable totaled $144 million and we maintained industry leading DSOs of 38 days reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio and the timing of invoices. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $657 million, an expected sequential increase due to the large annual payment I mentioned earlier. ", "We ended Q3 with approximately 5,650 employees, a year-over-year and sequential increase due primarily to our acquisition of Synplicity. Before moving on to guidance let me provide some additional commentary around Synplicity.", "The acquisition has been enthusiastically received by our customers and integration efforts are progressing well from a business process and employee perspective. For reporting purposes, you\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve adjusted our financial supplement to reflect the inclusion of Synplicity in the appropriate product groups. ", "Within core EDA, we\u2019ve added the Synplicity products associated with FPGA design. Within IP and systems, we\u2019ve added the products associated with ASIC rapid prototyping and DSP. Now moving on to guidance.", "For the fourth quarter of FY08, are targets are: revenue between $348 million and $356 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $295 million and $310 million which includes approximately $13 million of share based compensation expense, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $273 million and $283 million, other income and expense between zero and $3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between 147 million and 152 million, GAAP earnings of $0.23 to $0.29 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.36 to $0.39 per share.", "And we expect greater then 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog. Now our fiscal 2008 outlook, we\u2019re raising the bottom end of our revenue range with our new target between $1.332 billion and $1.340 billion, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 36%, outstanding shares between 147 million and 150 million, GAAP earnings per share between $1.20 and $1.26 which includes the impact of approximately $64 million in share based compensation expense. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.68. We\u2019ve increased the low end of our guidance by $0.05 and the top end of the guidance range by $0.04. And now that we\u2019re in our fourth quarter we\u2019ve refined our cash flow from operations target to $300 million to $325 million. We will provide 2009 guidance in our next earnings call reporting our fourth quarter results.", "To conclude I\u2019m pleased with another quarter of consistent execution and solid financial results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth, operating margin expansion, and solid cash flow generation. ", "With that we are now ready for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "I wanted to get your thoughts on the incremental change in the environment, it sounds from your comments that on the margin over the last three months, things have gotten a little more challenging in the EDA space, just wanted to get your color on that. Also last quarter you were good enough to provide some preliminary fiscal 2009 guidance and just wanted to get your thoughts on that, get your feel for how you feel about that guidance at this point. ", "Aart de Geus", "You characterized it correctly, I think it\u2019s incremental. We are certainly not in the school of saying there are very massive changes suddenly occurring. I do think that the entire semiconductor industry is looking forward saying; well what happened to the overall economy and when will that really hit us, but meanwhile keeps delivering all and all reasonable quarters. And so on the basis of reasonably okay results but a careful look, people are cautious as they commit going forward and we see some customers nervous towards committing for a long period of time.", "Now clearly that has had some impact on the EDA industry although I think a number of the changes that you saw recently were only marginally related to the economy, we have picked up a number of these signs and therefore are a bit careful ourselves and someone asked a few quarters ago if we picked up the slightest signs would we immediately take some action on the expense side, well we already did. ", "And in that sense, we are preparing well for the coming year. I gave in the preamble some initial indications of our planning right now assuming a 6% to 7% revenue growth and our initial estimates of the non-GAAP EPS to be in $1.70 to $1.80 range. Bear in mind we haven\u2019t finished our planning. There are a lot of things changing but overall we are just doing incredibly well I think in what appears to be a very turbulent EDA industry and certainly somewhat turbulent semiconductor industry. ", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "With respect to the cash from operations what was the driver for taking that down a bit from the $325 to the $300 to $325 million?", "Brian Beattie", "As we\u2019re now approaching of course deep into the fourth quarter and getting ready for year end, we\u2019re just looking at refining our cash flow from operations targets slightly so we\u2019re still working hard to bring it in, but given that it\u2019s the end of the year and if you look at timing of payments and collections we just wanted to align it properly with our current forecast. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "As you look into 2009 how should we think about, I know its preliminary, but how should we think about cash flow in 2009 and as it related to bookings in the current quarter, did bookings come in as you expected or were they a little weaker? Are you anticipating in the fourth quarter slightly weaker bookings then you might have forecast three months ago given the commentary on the environment? ", "Brian Beattie", "On the cash flow for 2009, what we\u2019re looking at there, we haven\u2019t provided all the final details of the profile but the biggest element to track is the net income item and as you look at that and look at the effective tax rates we\u2019ve been able to produce, that\u2019s a pretty good representation for us relative to this year\u2019s performance, our operating cash flow. So other then that when you look at balance sheets and what come in the quarter, what gets deferred and things, the net income is the most consistent element to track on a year-over-year basis. And we\u2019ll give you all the details of that in three more months when we do our year end call. ", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "How should we as we exit this year think about backlog given the large Intel deal some time ago? What\u2019s the appropriate way to think about how backlog should look coming out of this year? ", "Brian Beattie ", "We\u2019ll provide the specific numbers for the backlog at the end of this year and then from there of course you see the levels of revenue and bookings associated with it and I think the most important item to remember is that we continue to enter each quarter with more than 90% of the quarter locked up and then we also have each year approach the coming year with more then 80% of the incoming year relative to the amount of bookings coverage and revenue coverage that we have and we\u2019re not anticipating 2009 to be any different. We\u2019re right on track for that. ", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "So given all that, should backlog go up?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, that\u2019s the answer we\u2019ll be giving you in December. We\u2019re working it through. We don\u2019t comment quarterly on the bookings or the backlog impact, but again we\u2019re working hard to work on it. We\u2019ll give you the final answers as we exit the fourth quarter with all the year wrapped up. ", "Aart de Geus", "We don\u2019t comment on the bookings of the quarter but let me comment that for the year we\u2019re looking that we\u2019re on track against our plans. So in that sense there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. We did pick up though with a number of customers suddenly that just the sheer number of signatures was increasing. We saw a number of places that the process took longer and that people were although worried about the out years, and so what tells us is that people are just cautious about how they look at the longer term and we want to make sure that we keep signing up run rate growth business and that\u2019s why we are tempering a little bit our expectations for 2009. ", "But having said that the more I see the announcements around us, the better I feel about the position that we have and having seen how well the technology is doing at a number of places as people become more selective, I think Synopsys tends to bubble up to the top of their choice list. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Petkun \u2013 DA Davidson", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 DA Davidson", "The sequential increase in the upfront revenues, would you associate that, is much of that associated with the Synplicity business?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. Brian is probably better equipped to answer this question, I hadn\u2019t even noticed that there was a significant uptick there. Synplicity is a little bit more upfront then what we have but I think over time that will just blend in to the rest of our business anyway. ", "Brian Beattie", "And from a data point perspective its at 6%, our target is to maintain it at less then 10% and 6% is exactly what we hit for last year\u2019s upfront ratio. So no change there. And then just looking at timing of it in Q1 and Q2 it ran about 4%, we\u2019d anticipate it being in the 5% to 6% range for the total year inclusive of Synplicity which has the hardware element in there which will be taken upfront.", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 DA Davidson", "I know its difficult to talk about the pricing environment, but is there any reason given the blood in the water that we\u2019ve seen in other elements of this space why you might want to be more aggressive with pricing in this current environment?", "Aart de Geus", "I think the blood in the water description is somewhat accurate in a time of a lot of change. Let me immediately focus, that the move of one of our major competitors towards a ratable model I think is a very, very positive. I think it\u2019s a much healthier business model for the industry. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that over time more people were to go there. Having said that I think most of our growth and opportunities lies with the fact that we just have stellar technology right now and that we\u2019re really seeing the difference and so from that perspective, yes, we can be aggressive. ", "From the perspective of pricing, at the end of the day we make sure that we grow our run rates, that is what in the long-term will grow our business and obviously we can work the flexibility but jumping to pricing, its hard to jump back away from it later so I think we\u2019re prudent and conservative there. ", "Matthew Petkun \u2013 DA Davidson", "The implied non-GAAP guidance for next year, what tax rate are you assuming for those earnings? ", "Brian Beattie", "We\u2019ve assumed a 28% tax rate. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "First a clarification on Q3, can you comment on the sequential increase in Japan, was that too related to the Synplicity acquisition or perhaps was it carry over from previous quarters Synopsys bookings? ", "Brian Beattie", "Our performance in Japan was very strong and in fact you can see 22% growth over our last four quarters in Japan. But revenue by product platform or even geography does tend to fluctuate a little bit from quarter to quarter based on the mix of those contracts. In the quarter there was a couple of due and payables that came in to Japan consistent with the way a number of those accounts have been handled in the past and we\u2019re right on track with that, so other then that, real happy with the performance in Japan. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Are the DC and IC Compiler releases still on track for next month as you commented at DAC and similarly is the new release of PrimeTime still set for December?", "Aart de Geus", "Very simply put the answer is yes. I think things are actually moving along very nicely in technology and the products that you mentioned obviously are our core anchor products in our business. I have an interesting little side note because you will recall that about three years ago we said that 80% of [Astra] would be replaced by IC Compiler and so this morning I asked the team where we were, it turns out that we are a bit over 75% overall and for all the advanced nodes, 90nm and below, we\u2019re well above that. ", "And so I think IC Compiler has done very, very well in the last couple of years. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "So given that penetration rate when you look into 2009 and 2010, what\u2019s next then do you think in terms of the most incremental product growth drivers in terms of licenses or contributors to growing the pools for run rate purposes? ", "Aart de Geus", "We do have some stellar technology advancements. I mentioned Zroute which is interesting because its really one of the core modules that I think about makes a big difference that is now going to be rolled out substantially to a number of people. We also actually see that the adoption rate of IC Compiler specifically is continuing at a number of customers where we are over time replacing other competitors. So from that perspective alone, I think there\u2019s, the core EDA will remain very strong for us and of course that\u2019s good news because that\u2019s such a large portion of our business. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "With respect to other market indicators do you still feel that semi R&D is perhaps the closest albeit imperfect proxy, what else would you be looking at? ", "Aart de Geus", "I think both the word closest and imperfect apply here as we have said for a long time because the, in many ways the R&D investments are the ones that have the longest timeframe even with volume or ASPs going up and down the one thing that doesn\u2019t change all that much is the number of engineers working on advanced chips, so from that perspective the high degree of stability. At the same time it\u2019s very clear that some of the R&D investments are changing in the semiconductor industry by virtue of a number of companies getting out of the manufacturing and the new technology development themselves. ", "We should only hope that some of that money will be used to [inaudible] more on the design side which is good for us. Some of that money is also clearly going towards essentially efficiency for the semiconductor industry. And you see many other changes to that effect. So we\u2019re sitting in the middle of that with customers that are a bit nervous and yet at the same time have to commit for multi years and so they are looking at us in terms of not only the present strength of technology but also the pipeline going forward and being strongly anchored in the future nodes already I think suits us very, very well as they make their decisions. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "If the environment were to worsen before it gets better how do you think that might manifest itself in terms of contract durations, can you hold three years? Do you think you might see a preference towards shorter or even perhaps longer because of the consolidation affect? ", "Aart de Geus", "First a premise, at this point in time I do not see it worsening a lot. I think one could see turbulence meaning that some companies may do particularly well and others poorly and so you see more diffraction and the same is true in of course our market. Secondly you pointed out that there are two pathways which is yes, get people to sign up more with you. ", "The challenge to that is if you go too long you tend to be able to sign them up but not necessarily get as much run rate growth over the period of time as desired or as reflective of the strength of the technology. Lastly on holding the three year, we\u2019ve been holding the three year remarkably well and partially it\u2019s just another element of the stability of our business model and I think it\u2019s just pretty well the gestalt of the semiconductor industry. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen - Citigroup", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "I believe you said you had a 10% customer, I was wondering if you could give more specific number on what that customer was this quarter?", "Aart de Geus", "We never disclose specifically what the customers are, most people that have followed us for a number of years and who understand that there\u2019s some semiconductor guys that are very large have figured out that we will on an ongoing basis have essentially a 10% customer. Because the revenue is recognized on a ratable fashion, it\u2019s actually not a this quarter type of question, it\u2019s a deal that we did last year that will last for a number of years. You will see it reoccurring pretty much every quarter.", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "With regard to the cash flow number can you remind us what the target was last quarter and then update on specifically what has changed? ", "Brian Beattie", "The target that we had in our last quarter that we would to achieve approximately $325 million of operating cash flow in the year. The current perspective is that number would range between $300 million and $325 million and even when we look at our free cash flow number working to try to improve that as well, it brings into a range of about $260 million to $285 million on a free cash flow basis inclusive of the CapEx spending which we\u2019ve taken down pretty significantly year-over-year. ", "From the reason that its in that $300 million to $325 million range is just that we\u2019re at the end of our fourth quarter, getting into our fourth quarter and approaching year end and we\u2019ve been able to refine the exact cash flow anticipated by account and look at our payment outflows that are scheduled to happen and just giving ourselves a little bit of a range using that $300 million to $325 million so that we hit it. ", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the sales cycle was lengthening, and you\u2019ve alluded toward incremental cautioning on the part of customers, can you give us more specificity, is this just general customer reservation or is it related to customers that might be restructuring parts of their business or could you give us a little more color on why the sales cycle is lengthening? ", "Aart de Geus", "I don\u2019t want to overstate it because sales cycles lengthening sounds like a big deal, its almost more like in sales situations that are heading towards closure you suddenly get two, three, four weeks more signature loops then anything else. And that says one thing, that says typically that the approval is going up one or two levels in a company or that everything goes through the desk of the CFO. ", "Secondly when you said does it apply to companies that are restructuring, it feels to me almost like the entire semiconductor is constantly restructuring a little bit, not with the [inaudible] normally associated with that word, but rather with the objective of trying to line up businesses that are a little bit more critical mass in the sub market segments. It interesting just this morning to hear the announcement Erickson and [SD] are teaming up in the mobile domain and this is a mere three months later after [SD and NXP] teamed up and now taking over that piece. ", "And so those are good examples of changes that then bring about the, well how do you do the deals? How do you transition the contracts, etc. and it is more, turbulence is probably the best word rather then really a sales cycle lengthening. Maybe I used words that were a little bit too heavy for the situation. ", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "Regarding buyback, zero buyback this quarter, after having had some consistent buyback in the prior quarters what caused that in your term and how you think about that and also longer term obviously with the cash balance you have and targets really in the space being slightly smaller how do you think about cash longer term to perhaps enhance the return on equity? ", "Brian Beattie", "On our cash flows we mentioned this quarter we didn\u2019t buy any stock back but we have been very aggressive throughout 2008, we\u2019ve purchased 7.2 million shares for $170 million which is more then the 5.7 million we bought for all of FY07. and then in addition considering uses of cash we paid $181 million out of the cash at Synplicity to acquire that company in the third quarter so that was a significant investment and again we keep all of those options open whether we\u2019re going to be using our internal operations to invest that cash or whether we\u2019re looking at buybacks or M&A, we just continue to look at that and we still have $260 million remaining on the current authorization so again we\u2019re doing all we can in this area to improve our shareholder value and look at the right investment for the highest return. ", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "And then longer term perhaps the cash balance especially if you\u2019re looking at deceleration would you think more about trying to enhance increases in return on equity?", "Brian Beattie", "Absolutely, always focus on improving our return on equity, through both earnings per share improvement translating through operating margin and revenue growth, all which we have again addressed for 2009 and looking at the performance for 2008 as far as improving shareholder and enhancing return on equity again a very heavy investment in stock buybacks comparison to year-over-year. We continue to look at buybacks as an important area but as you can tell we just did our largest acquisition in several years with the acquisition of Synplicity so longer term really don\u2019t forecast a change. Just what are the right options, we continue to be a very significant cash generator with our business and we\u2019re going to look for the right returns for us that are going to enhance that shareholder value. ", "Terence Whalen \u2013 Citigroup", "You did mention the large acquisition of Synplicity, it seems like that\u2019s been integrated fairly well here, what is your appetite for other larger acquisitions in the space obviously given the high profile activities of the past quarter with competitors? ", "Aart de Geus", "This is another one of those where in principle we never comment about any potential M&A. Let me add to Synplicity, I think this was a very good acquisition because it\u2019s a combination of what is a very strong team, a slice of its business is in a very adjacent market to where we were, the [inaudible] market which I think holds promise from another perspective which is they are very rapidly moving to the advanced technology nodes, more rapidly then some of the mainstream ASICs therefore there\u2019s more opportunity there. ", "And of course there\u2019s also a slice that is attached to the rapid prototyping that fits in extremely well in our overall systems strategy. So so far this is turning out to be a very good move and integrations don\u2019t take just three months, it takes longer then that but if the first three months go particularly well, that is a very good indicator for the future. Having said that, it is very good to have cash in a time where there\u2019s a lot of turbulence and obviously we will be looking at opportunities as they show up and of course Synopsys is an opportunity as well. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "When you talk about the increased caution in your outlook for 2009 how should we, that caution between probably smaller size products which you expect from your customers versus possibly some of your customers pushing out their purchase of your more advanced tools?", "Aart de Geus", "I don\u2019t think that they are going to push out advanced tools at all because the very way to do well and to survive is to execute well on your advanced projects where most of the money is made, most of the profitability is there and granted also most of the risk is there and so in that context I expect that if our caution is warranted, that customers are going to be more selective in who they work with, in trying to have closer relationships with those providers, because aside of the software, they are the human capital that we put to bear on making chips successful is actually quite significant. ", "And it\u2019s not a surprise to me that a number of the people that have become our partners and for which we are primary vendors have actually had significant success with some of their advanced chips because of the close collaboration. So it\u2019s coming mostly from that angle. At the same time we clearly watch the turbulence in our markets and therefore we want to set expectations that we think we can live up to well and given the strength that we have we\u2019re going to race forward. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "If I understand you correctly when you look out into next year and if you look at your customers outside the leading edge customers, are you finding the pace of transition of the [inaudible] nodes is going according to what you anticipated three to six months back? ", "Aart de Geus", "Let me debunk a few things, I think one needs to look at two categories. One is the category of people that differentiate themselves because they put more functionality on chips, they drive the state of the art and so on and I would say fundamentally there\u2019s no change there. At times I have given you the design starts for the more advanced nodes. If you look at 45nm that went up again this quarter from last quarter, 159 active designs to now 186 and the number of tape outs is moving up as well. We also already see now an increasingly rapid uptake at 32nm and some other advanced nodes that I can\u2019t really comment about. So on the advanced side, this thing is still moving very, very rapidly and those are the people that actually drive the bulk of the spending in EDA. ", "In the more mainstream or fast follower/mainstream, there what we see is an interesting phenomenon which is that some of the older nodes are hanging around a little longer which does not mean that this is not advanced design because a number of customers take some of the older nodes, let\u2019s say a 130nm and just squeezing much harder to try to get the maximum functionality mostly driven by cost and so if they can do that with a cheaper technology, good for them, but it can be quite demanding there as well.", "Interestingly enough we see IC Compiler for example being used in both situations to people that really want to do one more pass on their 130nm chip as well as the people that are really driving a 32nm chip. So I think more [inaudible] in that sense is alive and well and we are part of keeping it alive. ", "Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Can you talk about your custom design platform?", "Aart de Geus", "We started with some hints about three quarters or four quarters ago that we had such projects in the works. We said at that time that end of our last calendar year we would go into Beta, we did that. Betas have progressed well, the product has become more and more solid and as a matter of fact it compares well in robustness to some of the new offerings from the competition and at that time we said we would introduce it during the year. We were purposely a little vague, was it the fiscal year or the calendar year? We are sharper now; it will be during the fiscal year which means we will introduce it this quarter. ", "We haven\u2019t introduced it so we can\u2019t say too much. It should be clear that our objective is not to do a carbon copy of what others have, but rather learn from what has been an evolution of 25, 30 years in analog mixed signal design. Make sure that we have a strong basis upon which we can build for the future but also deal with some of the issues that some of the existing tools have had for a long period of time so that customer is immediately see some pointed benefits and so far it appears that we are well on track with that effort. ", "Operator", "I will now turn it back to management for any closing remarks. ", "Aart de Geus", "We appreciate your time and your support over the last quarter. You have obviously seen a very interesting and somewhat moving set of changes in our industry. At the same time its very clear that Synopsys is a pillar of solidity I hope and that we are clearly building on that and are looking forward with quite a bit of confidence.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)", "Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Sandy. Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call Synopsys may make forecast, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our 10-K, our 10-Q for the third quarter and in our earnings release for the fourth quarter issued earlier today. In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in our fourth quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at synopsys.com.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I am happy to report a strong Q4 and fiscal '08, strong technology and competitive momentum and most notable in this environment, strong revenue backlog for fiscal '09.", "Let me begin with our financial results. In Q4 and fiscal '08, we either met or exceeded virtually all of our goals despite a major change in the environment starting in mid-summer. Specifically, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter and a $1.71 for the year. That $0.14 above the mid point target we communicated at the beginning of \u201808.", "With Q4 revenue of $353 million, we grew our business 10% for the year to $1.337 billion. These results were achieved under a predictable business model with more than 90% time-based revenue.", "To discipline expense control and focus on efficiency, we improved non-GAAP ops margin over last year from 20% to 23%. We excited the year with over $900 million in cash and no debt. While we grew our overall backlog, most importantly our one year backlog is almost $1.2 billion. In other words, we have over 80% of 2009s targeted revenue already in hand.", "Our excellent results in '08 provide the uniquely solid foundation going into '09, especially in the context of a global economy that is highly unpredictable. Our working assumption is that the current recession is likely to last through at least to 2009. Consumer and business caution are already leading to more conservative spending and demand for electronics will certainly be affected.", "Not surprisingly, cost management is key for our customers, as they revisit every aspect of their operations for efficiency and strategic effectiveness. In many ways the economic stress is accelerating efficiency initiatives that have been visible for a while, such as the move from internal manufacturing to external foundries, for example.", "In the last two years, we have also seen increased segment consolidation as customer seek efficiency through market share gains, where they have strong offering. At the same time, they cannot compromise on technology and today's chips require advanced EDA capabilities.", "To balance cost and efficiency, we see customers actively reducing the number of their suppliers and choosing key partners that are technically strong, financially healthy and safe, and that can help to reduce design costs in the overall design flow. This is why Synopsys is uniquely well positioned to be the partner of choice.", "One, we are financially stable with a strong cash position, no debts, good cash flow, strong backlog and a conservative business model, making us a stable partner as customers actively derisk their future. Two, we have strong well integrated technology and a comprehensive solution that is complemented by crucial IP and very experienced global support, ready to help customer streamline their overall cost of design.", "And three, we have the strategic vision and resources to continue to invest in the key technologies of the future. Indeed, in the last 18 months, a growing number of customers have chosen preferred relationships with Synopsys. In Q4, we announced another primary partner relationship with Sanyo, which chose to standardize on our design and verification platforms.", "We also expanded to other large customer relationships, one of which is scheduled to become our primary partner relationship overtime. Within these companies, we are displacing competitors in place-and-route, functional verification, custom designs and physical verification.", "Going forward, we plan to come out of the present economic slump and even stronger company. To that end, our strategy is best characterized as both cautious and bold. Our objectives are to financially out-execute others by adapting to the new landscape, while fundamentally staying the course in terms of business model and financial principles, to competitively solidify and expand our position to the most cost efficient complete design solutions and to strategically invest to expand our total addressable market.", "Well this means financially for '09 is the following: Solid revenue growth of approximately 5% starting with the unique foundation of over 80% of '09 revenue in hand today.", "Steady operating margin, around 23% driven by active cost reductions and pointed investments to further strengthen our competitive position and continued solid non-GAAP earnings per share in the $60 to $72 range. Brian will provide more detailed guidance in a moment. Let me comment, that our guidance is in broader ranges, than we have typically given reflecting the market uncertainty, but also to give us more freedom and execution as opportunities may arise.", "Moving on to those competitive landscapes: We are uniquely well positioned to provide a comprehensive solution as customers seek to simply their EDA commitments. Those of you, that have followed Synopsys for some time, know that we have spent years moving to a complete solution by developing, acquiring and integrating best in class tools from the system level through simulation, synthesis, place-and-route all the way down to the physics of manufacturing.", "After that a strong semiconductor IP portfolio and a global support force capable of assisting with the most difficult designs in the world, and Synopsys stands out as the lead contender for our customers EDA needs. The strength of our technology portfolio has been crucial in growing the trust of our customers, as they select preferred partners. In 2008, we delivered a multitude of technology advances, ranging from broad support of multi-core processing to expanded low power capabilities.", "Our physical design solution, IC compiler was further strengthened by a brand new router delivering 10X faster performance and better quality of results. We are seeing significant customer wins including business from competitors. On the manufacturing side, we also integrated formally separate pre-manufacturing steps map synthesis and map data prep giving customers a dramatic and highly differentiated improvement in overall throughput.", "This brings me to the third tenant of our strategy. Focused investments in our long-term growth, in practice this means three things; solidifying our core EDA anchor solutions and expanding our customer presence. We are rolling out our analog custom design solution, thus filling the last meaningful hole in our offering and investing in the emerging system level solutions area.", "I already mentioned some of the progress made on our traditional anchor products. However, the highlight for Q4 was the roll-out of custom designer, our longer awaited analog mixed signal design solution. Custom designer is a modern open platform built to link well with IC compiler and other Synopsys solutions. It\u2019s easy to use, easy to adopt and has a large number of differentiated features that\u2019s a path old competitive technologies.", "Customer feedback has been excellent especially regarding the ease of adoption and stability of the code. Even with limited customer availability we had our first orders in Q4. Our IP business also deserves mention. We not only added a significant collection of new course to our offering, but also grew the business as outsourcing semiconductor IP for costs reasons is becoming more main stream.", "Finally our FPGA based rapid prototyping system is seeing excellent momentum. In the both chip verification and embedded software development our solution go straight to the heart of one of the key cost and time challenges in modern chip and system design. On Monday we announced that we were acquiring the CHIPit assets ProDesign, a significant broadening of our rapid prototyping offering that plays well in to our long-term vision of moving further towards system level design and verification.", "In summary and not withstanding the macroeconomic challenges, we will continue to invest in these areas of opportunity for Synopsys. To conclude, we had an outstanding 2008 in every key financial and operational metric. Even with the economic stress around us, Synopsys is heading into 2009 with very solid financial, technical and business foundation.", "Our strategy for 2009 is simple. We intend to weather the storm and take advantage of the near-term recession and come out of the other side even stronger by being a financially conservative, competitively aggressive and strategically focused.", "With that now I will turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and yearend and provide you with more details of our 2009 guidance. As a reminder, I will be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement posted on the website.", "In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year and also specify otherwise. Synopsys delivered solid fourth quarter and full fiscal year results, executing well at many fronts. In fact our consistent performance throughout the year enable us to meet or exceed all of our original 2008 targets including revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow.", "Now let me provide some additional details on our financials. Q4 revenue increased 12% to $352.8 million and annual revenue grew 10% to $1.337 billion. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue.", "Turning to expenses, Q4 GAAP expenses were $287.5 million, which included $9.3 million of amortization of intangible assets and $14.7 million of share-based compensation. For the year, GAAP expenses were $1.118 billion, which included $44.1 million of amortization of intangible assets and $65.5 million of share-based compensation.", "Total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $280.5 million in Q4 and $1.026 billion for all of 2008. We held cost in line with our original 2008 expense budget even with the addition of Synplicity. For all of fiscal 2008, we achieved our operating margin target of 23%, an increase of about 300 basis points in Q4, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5%. We continue to derive companywide operational discipline and expense control.", "Our strategy as Aart mentioned, is to reduce expenses in certain areas, so that we are able to invest in others that will drive long-term growth. In FY \u201808 we focused on the design and development phase of reengineering and our entire development to cash process to maximize efficiency. We hired in lower cost geographies and we reduced capital spending by 13%, as we centralized IT resource management.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.32 for the quarter and $1.29 for the year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter and $1.71 for the year, both above 2007 levels and our target ranges for 2008 driven by solid top line growth, expense management and lower taxes.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% in Q4 and 24.1% for the full year, both well below our target ranges due primarily to the reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit in United States in Q4 and certain one time tax adjustments.", "Our revenue visibility remain strong, up front revenue was 7% in Q4 and 5% for all of FY \u201808 well within our range of less than 10%. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter and fiscal year remained approximately three years.", "As Aart mentioned, we have greater than 80% of revenue in hand for the coming year and more than 90% for the coming quarter. We increased overall backlog to the book to bill slightly higher than one.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items: At year-end, cash and short-terms investments totaled $951 million, up $74 million sequentially, due to a strong operating cash flow of $114 million. For the year, operating cash flow was $331 million, meeting our original target established in December of '07. Of our total cash balance, 53% is in the U.S. and 47% is outside the U.S.", "In terms of cash flow, we believe a fairly good indicator of operating cash flow overtime is EBITDA, while of course its not a perfect indicator operating cash flow tends to fluctuate around longer term EBITDA trends. At this time, we are targeting operating cash flow of approximately $200 to $220 million in FY '09. The decline from '08 is due to both less schedule collections and increased disbursements.", "On the collection side, the slightly lower level is primarily driven by three factors. First, because of schedule renewals in '09, we're planning for our book to bill moderately lower than one. Second, we thought it was prudent to collect as much cash as possible in '08. And third, while we haven't seen a material change in our customer's ability to pay us, we're being conservative in our cash collection assumptions, given the uncertain economic environment.", "From the cash outflow side. We are currently expecting higher payments due to increased expenses, including a full year impact from Synplicity and higher tax payments. Having said that, our cash flow continues to be very strong and based on our current, we expect EBITDA to be roughly flat in fiscal 2009. Given the volatility in the global financial markets, I'd also like to take a minute on this call to comment on our cash portfolio, as it relates to our investment guidelines and strategies.", "Our Board requires that all our holdings have very high credit ratings of AA or better. As a result, we invest our domestic cash exclusively in highly rated municipal bonds and tax exempt AAA rated money market funds that hold municipal securities. Our cash outside the U.S. is invested in AAA rated money market funds and time deposits, with what we consider healthy financial institutions.", "And finally, we have had no exposure to auction rate securities or mortgage-backed securities and are very pleased with the high quality and conservative risk profile of our investment portfolio. Now, continuing along with or cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $12 million in the quarter and $39 million for the year. In Q4, we purchased 2.4 million shares of Synopsys stock for $50 million.", "For the full fiscal year, we purchased 9.6 million shares for $220 million spending 75% of our '08 free cash flow and buying back about twice as many shares as we issued during the year. We have approximately $210 million remaining on our current authorizations. Also recall, that we spend a net $181 million in cash on our acquisition of Synplicity in Q3, both the stock buyback and our Synplicity acquisition, were sourced from our U.S. cash reserves.", "Q4 net accounts receivables totaled $147 million and our industry leading DSO was flat sequentially at 38 days, reflecting a high quality of our AR portfolio and the timing of invoices. Deferred revenues at the end of the quarter were $680 million.", "Now at the end of the year we had approximately 5,700 employees. This was an expected increase on a year-over-year basis due primarily to our acquisition of Synplicity, to generally flat with Q3 as we put a hiring freeze in place in the fourth quarter. As Aart discussed, we just announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the CHIPit assets of ProDesign's to accelerate our efforts in the fast growing rapid prototyping market. It's expected to be an all cash deal and financial terms were not disclosed. We don\u2019t expect a material impact to our 2009 guidance.", "Now let me address our first quarter and fiscal 2009 guidance and then provide some additional comments on our expense assumptions for the year. For the first quarter of FY '09, our targets are revenue between $332 million and $340 million. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $276 million and $291.5 million, which includes approximately $13.8 million of share based compensation expense.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $253 million and $263 million down from $280 million in Fourth quarter, other income and expense between zero and $3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between 145 million and 150 million, GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.31 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now for fiscal 2009, here are the key metrics. Based on what we know now, we expect revenues between $1.38 million and $1.41 billion, other income and expense between $4 million and $8 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%. Outstanding shares between $145 million and $150 million, GAAP earnings per share between a $1.07 and a $1.26, which includes the impact of approximately $58 million in share based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share, of a $1.60 to a $1.72 and again cash flow from operations of approximately $200 million to $220 million.", "We have a unique window of opportunity in front of us. Our position as a company is to take full advantage of it. Even as we invest in technology development and advancing our customer relationships, we will closely manage expenses to reach our margin targets. In 2009, we are focused on several expense control initiatives. We are planning to hold, employee cost relatively flat, including diligently managing our headcount levels, and reviewing our contractor costs.", "We are now in the implementation phase or reengineering our global quote to cash process, with a goal of making the process faster and easier, for both ourselves and our customers. We are rolling out, enhanced internal reporting and the analytic tools to better control and manage global expenses such as travel and procurement. And we are reducing our capital spending by another 15% in 2009 to approximately $30 million to $35 million.", "Now finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some additional 2009 commentary including our quarterly expense profile. We expect total cost and expenses to increase generally inline with or slightly less than, our targeted revenue growth. We believe this is the appropriate expense level to take full advantage of this unique opportunity we have in front of us. It also reflects the near term revenue transition, and integration of Synplicity.", "We are expecting a typical quarterly expense profile throughout the year, with a modest sequential increase in total expenses in both Q2 and Q3, and a traditionally higher Q4.", "We expect our operating cash quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with the net operating cash out flow during the first half of \u201809 due primarily to the timing of our annual incentive compensation payments. While, these assumptions are based on the current environment and our internal operating targets, our management team is fully prepared to react quickly on expenses, should things materially change.", "We will continue to be physically conservative and focused on responsible investing to enhance our leadership and emerge from these challenging times in a stronger competitive position. While our near-term goal is to expand our competitive presence, while sustaining margins in this environment, we remain committed to longer term operating margin targets of mid-to-high 20s.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 results. While the economic environment is uncertain, we enter 2009 in excellent financial condition and look forward to another year of solid business execution.", "And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera with Needham. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "Thanks, good evening gentlemen. Brian, you talked about EBITDA expected to be flat in \u201809 versus \u201808, can you give us the EBITDA number for \u201808 if you have that convenient?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, I do just, 2008 the number came in at $364 million.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "Great. Looking at your expected share account for fiscal \u201809, it doesn\u2019t look like you plan to get particularly aggressive on a buyback. This, despite the fact that it would appear that buyback is quite accretive at current stock levels. Is there anything that would make you get more aggressive on a share buyback or do you really want to keep that much dry powder around for other opportunities?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. It's a great question. We're just constantly looking at the capital structure even more so now of what cash we have on hand, where we hold it and obviously how it's invested. So, it's an awful lot of visibility going into how that cash has been managed. I also outlined the amount of the cash that was both in the US and the amount of cash that was outside of the US. So, again that narrows the ability of using that cash in the US for things like stock repurchases and for some of the M&A investments we have here locally too.", "So, we constantly look at where we're going spend that cash or lot of great opportunities both in terms of the operating piece of it. We need to maintain the flexibility given the current credit markets we've got, and again look for M&A opportunities that present themselves in this environment. So, the buyback program is still very consistent in part of that structure as well. We still have dollars remaining on our authorization and we'll continue to balance those opportunities as we move forward.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "Brian, you mentioned you expected a book-to-bill slightly less than one in fiscal '09. Can you elaborate on that, how much of that is due to a renewal schedule, which maybe is little lighter than fiscal '08 and how much of that is due to expectations of maybe lower run rates on renewals due to the weaker macro environment?", "Brian Beattie", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s almost all related to the renewal schedule as we look forward to the contracts that are up for renewal in 2009. It just looks like again a moderately decline in that book-to-bill ratio for the year, so really on renewals.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "So, I guess just to follow-up on that. What has been your experience, you have in October closed your quarter obviously October was a very challenging period to be doing business? What was your experience in closing deals in terms of run rate, are you successfully maintaining run rates at this point, are you seeing a lot of pushback on customers trying to actively reduce run-rates?  If you could give any color, that would be helpful.", "Aart de Geus", "Maybe I can't comment on that, this is Aart. In October, we actually continued to grow our run rates and I think that's a good sign because, that means that the people investing with us are investing for the longer term. I think one of the aspects on their renewals is I wouldn't be surprised if people become a little bit more cautious about long-term renewals, just because they look at the uncertainty around us in the world and are just cautious in making commitment.", "And so, I'm glad you bring up the notion of run rate because that's clearly what we are paying a lot of attention to, as that is a key health indicator for our business going forward and so -- so far so good in our business.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "And Aart, how do you think that will manifest itself, do you think your duration, your average ratio will actually go below three, where people want shorter commitments like one and two year as opposed to the average three year deals?", "Aart de Geus", "The honest answer is I don't know. I just think that with this amount of change around us, there will be changes. And so it could go either way actually. You could go the directions where people say,  \"I don't want to make long-term commitments, I don't know what's coming towards me\". And that would say shorter duration, you should see that also.  So, no, I want to make a bigger commitments from a preferred partner point of view; let's go longer duration.", "And so because none of us has faced the economic situation we have around us, we are trying to execute very thoroughly, while leaving ourselves a fairly high degree of flexibility, and how we get there is by paying great a deal of attention to the very basics of what is good business. Ultimately, we'd like to see this as an opportunity for Synopsys to strengthen its position with the customers that matter most.", "Rich Valera - Needham", "Okay. Thank you and good luck in '09.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Hi, thanks. Aart, just to follow-up to the previous question. Can you talk a little bit more about what changes you've actually seen over the last few months in your customer base? Maybe a little color on how some of the conversations you are having with key semiconductor executives, how those are going, what's the tone of those conversations at this point?", "Aart de Geus", "Well if there's one uniform phrase coming out of the vast majority of the customers, it is this term of \"no visibility\" and they immediately characterized, it doesn't mean that there is not a substantial amount of business comes in, it just is not clear when and exactly how. And that brings about a fairly high degree of caution. The second aspect is that  people look around the economy and all come to the same conclusion, which is okay; cost management is absolutely essential and there are two or three ways to look at that.", "The first way is not to do projects that go nowhere. In normal times its always difficult to cut these things, in stress times people find a way to do that and reinvest the efforts in those projects that are more promising. Second is to look at every one of your processes, including the design process and see how you can streamline it more. And that is why we are moving more towards integrated design flows, fewer vendors, looking at which IP wants you internally versus externally, all of these things are on the table; and as you well know, for many years we have essentially prepared the company for that direction.  I think that moment is upon us now", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "And do you see that I mean a normalized environment for people even when business gets slower?  Not to cut R&D projects, key product development projects in 2001, 2002 and when facing a deep downturn, they did?  Are you beginning to see that in your customer base or is that not started yet?", "Aart de Geus", "Not massively so. I think rather than cutting projects it's almost more like people are looking at their entire business unit structure and they have five business units why don\u2019t I sell this one to somebody who is in the same segment and can do better. In other words, you get to what I would call a \"segment consolidation\" long before you get a lot of project cutting.", "Now underneath, I think there is no question that people are looking at every aspect of their business and partially because of the economic stress. It gives management internally the mandate to do something and therefore they are actually moving more rapidly than they would normally.", "So, I think that over time we will get there. We have not seen any slowdown in the most advanced chips and I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a big slowdown. We have seen that a number of customers are hanging around longer at the older notes and I think I have shared that trends with you now for at least 18 months or so. This does not mean that it will have sophisticated design; it just means that people are squeezing even more out of the older more amortized notes for cost reasons.  The word cost is pretty much essential to the vocabulary of old top executives.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "And if I might ask a couple more questions?  You mentioned share and have mentioned share a couple of times over the last couple of quarters. Your view that you are taking some share and some of the bigger deals you have done. Any sense for how much share you have gained over the last year or any projection about how much share you think you might be able to gain over the next year given the chaos amongst some of your competitors?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the term share has been misused many times in many of the EDA earnings releases. At the end of the day it is sustainable revenue, so that gives you the share. We are growing our revenue and I think one of the key reasons we are able to do that is because a number of customers are making growing commitments with us and because of the quite conservative revenue recognition model that we have, I think the revenue you see is really where we are as a company.", "So I think the opportunity space is clearly impacted by the overall economic down pressure. There's no question about that. On the other hand it is precisely because of that, that customers are going to move faster in some of their efficiency pushes and I do think that we are well positioned to help them with that and hopefully that will actually have positive impact on our growth potential.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "I promise. Last question: you mentioned TAM expansion as an objective and you talked about being maybe a little careful in terms of use of cash for strictly buybacks etcetera. When you think about where you want to take the footprint of Synopsys from a TAM perspective, where are the areas you want to expand over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, two comments. First I want to make sure that people understand. We are not adverse to buying back our own stock. We are just very, very cognizant that we are in a time period where cash is king again and so we like the cash position that we have. We clearly see that one could potentially expend in the agencies that we've already have a footprint in and a couple of that spend out as clearly, how we can invest internally or otherwise in what we do in the IP and the Rapid Prototyping in the moving towards the system side. But I wouldn't discount, also the fact that, some of our core Anchor tools are becoming stronger and therefore more competitive as we approach customers to focus more on Synopsys as their primary partner.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Thanks for all that.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matt Petkun with D. A. Davidson & Company. Please go ahead.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. Aart, when you guys provided initial guidance last year or not last year, last quarter. I think one of things you suggested is that you don't want to set the bar too high because you saw that your competitors would likely be facing a tough environment and would be perhaps willing to do some potentially natural things on the pricing side? At least judging by their equity valuations, their situations haven't improved. How is the pricing environment right now? And how do you maintain appropriate pricing in an environment like this?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I\u2019m of the school that you don't want to move a lot on pricing because pricing tends to never come back and so far we've done okay with that. I think, the pricing is actually interesting and often I think a lesser consideration than the decision to invest with vendors that are stable and going to be there for the long run. So, let's not forget that, that many companies right now are looking around and say how can I derisk my future, while, driving my internal efficiency.", "And so that is actually I think the bigger consideration for many of our customers and I do think that, as all the competitors have a move more ratable business model. There is a natural better ability of industry to be more careful with the pricing practices anyway.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. Then just looking at the revenue mix the upfront portion of your business is up nicely year-over-year almost 28% and environment that I\u2019d think would be challenging to get upfront deals done. Is that mostly Synplicity business?   Please remind us if the mix of through Synplicity. How much the hardware business should be as the portion of that total business.", "Brian Beattie", "Sure. Our model, just to clarify again, is that we would have less than 10% of our revenues coming from upfront transactions and by of the majority more than 90% coming from transactions that are done on a time-based environment.", "So, that still the tend of our underlying business model through the last several years and of course go into \u201809 and \u201810. So, we are aiming to keep it up below 10, so you have the consistency and predictability around that the top line in the business side. So, relative to the achievement in the quarter, while the upfront were again well within that less than 10% range for both Q4 and the total year. And it does include now the addition of the hardware piece of Synplicity.", "In overall, we\u2019re not really breaking out the details of Synplicity in that level, but if you recall we had talked about the range of $21 million to $23 million of revenue coming from Synplicity in 2008 in our numbers and they delivered against that model. So, that\u2019s a little bit more breakout of the revenue line.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on that, are one of the things the Synplicity was really hoping to launch this year was really some tools that help people not just get prototypes on to these FPGA boards, but actually helps take those boards up to, simulators like you\u2019ve provide or is that offering now up and running you perhaps gaining share relative to emulators, as a result or at least increasing the addressable market?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, it's a good question because there is no question that the whole verification side of the design flow is becoming much, much larger. And that is extenuated by the way, by the fact that there is a lot of embedded software that goes with lot of the chips. And so in that context, the Rapid Prototypin to emulation space is one that we are highly interested in. And of course, the challenge with emulator is notwithstanding that for some applications they are great, is that they are very, very expensive and a bulky machines that are not particularly flexible for many applications. And so your description is actually correct.", "What we're doing is connecting it more and more to our simulation environment and this is a really multi-stage effort because there is both connecting downwards to the RTL simulation but also upwards to our virtual prototyping, which is essentially the software version of Rapid Prototypin. And then in there addition, we added yet another tenant with the CHIPit's acquisition, which adds some more capabilities that also allow us to play in some of the end applications that are software rich and where there's also some real time capabilities.", "We have, I think at this point in time, a very good portfolio. And the pieces will continue through a multi year both evolution and integration. But it's an area that we're bullish and positive about.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Okay,  One final question. There wasn't tremendous amount of growth, in fact the growth is now slowing, it looks like in your manufacturing related revenues, DFM related revenue if you will. Is that mostly just due to lower CADs business this year, as the overall capital equipment markets have declined? And how do you see DFM offerings expanding over the next couple of years?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think in general the results in a market that is highly played by all in all very few customers, fluctuates quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to year. The offering is doing well. I think that what we are going to see is that the manufacturing guys are under as much cost pressures as anybody right now, because they get immediately hit by anything that touches volume. And so my guess is, that will be an area that will be fairly careful in it's spending in the near-term.", "Having said that though, it is a very, very good anchor point for many of our other tools and we debate continually if we actually should split this out or not in our counting. But being all the way down into TCAD, which is almost the atomic level, all the way up to the place-and-route, is actually good position for us. So, I think you're just going to see some fluctuations.", "Matt Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, how would you compare the current environment, what we saw back in '01 and '02? I suppose in one respect at least it's very much the same with EDA almost certain to decline as an industry this year, as it did in '02. But what other differences or similarities might there be between this environment and that last EDA recession?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think one has to move to the big picture immediately, which is there's a reason people are talking about a global recession because it is touching pretty much every aspect of the modern economy. And as a matter of fact, when discussing with many of the semiconductor guys, they will all say, well, there are some big differences in '01 we had way too much inventory. In '01 there was oversupply and at this point in time the semiconductor people think, \"hey we are a victim here; this has nothing to do with our industry\". Having said that, the victim or not, you are part of it and so the pressure is coming from a much more global perspective.", "Now zooming in on to your question, is still making the question what's the impact all the way into our industry. Well on one hand, we are obviously subject to the same cost pressures of all of our customers wanting to save money. On the other hand, we are the core of the very thing that differentiates them and keeps them alive.", "Secondly in the last few years, many customers have essentially greatly decreased their R&D spending on the manufacturing side, thus freeing up some of that money to go towards design.", "Now design has become more complex and so the combination of all of those things leads them to look at design not as a whole set of point to task, but more and more as a profit that needs to be orchestrated and managed to efficiency and productivity and predictability.", "And those are exactly the angles that we've taken for a while and I think they are starting to resonate more than they did in the past partially because pressures always makes you look at what's essential.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "", "Would it be fair to say that at the technology level one difference between now and then is that backend one or two. There was really only one important product upgrade going on at the time physical synthesis, we are to-date or might be perhaps multiple technology upgrades than necessarily need to incur?", "Aart de Geus", "I would almost go the opposite direction which has -- lot of focus at that time was on product upgrades and so on. Nobody is talking to us about products today. It's all about what's the overall solution and how do we manage productivity.", "What can you do to help me bring my cost down and so the dialog in times of economic pressure invariably moves up and it invariably moves to the executive who says well you know I may not understand completely EDA. I know it's important but help me understand why and where and how much should I spend on this?", "And it all goes back to the cost equations, and so that doesn't mean that they are not fabulous technical advances, and we are certainly proud of quite a number of the new products and new capabilities that we have. It's just that I think we have moved to more of an economic dialogue than just the technology dialog. That doesn't mean that you can bypass technology.", "I think technology has to be not only good enough it has to have legs going forward and one needs to have a vision where it's heading, but the economic priorities it's only a key in the dialog.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Brain, with respect to the book-to-bill comment for '09, you alluded to it's been largely a function of the renewals calendar. When we look back at progression of '06 bookings, the worst quarter clearly was Q1 pretty lower bookings number, the rest of the quarter is above six, three years ago assuming you were here to the three durations. Russia not that bad second, third and fourth quarters of '06 did reasonably well particularly well Q4. So, would you say that the issue for '09 is largely a weak renewals calendar in Q1, why not release in first half and perhaps the rest of the year it starts looking normal?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, on a quarterly renewal basis it's really not the most critical metrics of when deals renew, if they renew on time if they renew a quarter in advance or that relative to the financial performance of the company. I think said we do profile as we laid out some of the discussions around Q1 revenues around the expense profile, we see throughout the year. But it's pretty consistent of when the deals are up for renewal. They get negotiated anywhere between three months to a year in advance to those renewal dates to try to identify the new capabilities, number of seeds, the new product offerings and again we have to be pretty flexible if you work through these opportunities in front of us.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Aart, with respect to the analogue product, the custom designer, you've got the second version and GA coming in the spring. Do you think that could trigger over the remainder of \u201809 after it goes to general release, perhaps a few ten to millions of dollars of incremental bookings from that product line?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, as you know we never talk about specific bookings for a specific product. Let me remind you that one of the key things, why we wanted to have a good position in custom design is because we wanted to have a complete solution. And I think that was the strategic objective that we wanted to meet and I think subject to continued improvement, I think we have just made fantastic strides in that.", "Presently having said that, I think the product is actually looking quite good and I already started to communicate to you, I think in the spring that we saw that the quality of the product was very high in other words, very few bug issues and so on. What we know now is that the adoption in, is actually better than something what I would have suspected and so those are all good thought.", "Now you have to put that under the umbrella of the overall landscape of change and so we will absolutely drive a business, who are custom designer because there is an opportunity, there are a number of customers I would like to work with alternatives to what's been on the market and I looking for the new features, at the same as I said earlier, I think most of the dialogues with customers is about overall solutions and this is just great timing for us to have fill this gap.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tim Fox with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. First question, just going back to the book-to-bill one more time, if I might, the lower outlook for revenue now for '09, you obviously knew what the renewal calendar was last quarter heading in to '09 and you\u2019re talking also about maintaining run rates and additionally picking up some market share. So, I\u2019m just wondering, how to fill in that blank of why the lower outlook for '09?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, first there is no blank to fill. Meaning that, I think there is a little bit of a misconception on the word \"renewal\". Many people think, you do a pretty good deal and therefore all these things renew constantly and sort of they, a three year cycle. That's actually not the case.", "Our field people continually interact with the customer, many of the renewals are earlier and they\u2019re not really a renewal, you sell them additional things, you sell them more things and so our objective is to continually growth the run rate with the customer, renewal or no renewal as a matter of fact.", "Secondly, I think that we do try to look at roughly how many and which ones are the deals that would likely to come about and as we looked at the weather forecast on the outside, you currently do one thing, which is be as conservative as you can possibly be and there is no point whatsoever in renewing with customers that have one objective, which is get into a much, much, much lower cost point unless you can grab significantly more market share.", "And so the way we are looking at this is, a combination of conservative, but stay very much on the ball or focusing on the run rate and precisely because we have a very, very good backlog for \u201809 and already substantial backlog for '010 and '011. This allows us to sort of weather the storm and be judicious in how we worked the new opportunities.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. And Brian again going back to the cash flow and just looking at the guidance. Your GAAP net income looks like it down about 13% or so, but cash flow guidance is down about 60%. I am just wondering could you help maybe with the puts and takes you talked about and guide us through what are the major changes that really driving that 60% drop in cash flow. I mean are you looking at any major diversions in D&A or stock-based comp or is this going to be more of a deferred revenue change, you can help us try to understand the puts and takes so that will be helpful?", "Brian Beattie", "You bet. I mean cash as it's to sell critical right of watching each to the inflows and outflows that are coming and it's a good metric. As we look at the year in front of us here, we see both that we're going to have slightly less collections than we had seen in 2008 and that we are going to see some increased disbursements. So at a high level that's really what cash is all about. When we looked at the collection side of the equation, we over achieved our cash collection target actually by about $25 million in our fourth quarter, as you can see we came in very, very strong in cash for the entire year.", "And just believe it's better to have the cash in our pockets, if you like, given the environment that we're in. So, from a swing perspective of what happens from '08 going to '09 that is contributes about $50 million right, its kind on both sides of the equation. And that's as I said about $25 million of being overly achieving the targets we had set out for ourselves in that fourth quarter. The other thing is we're just again being conservative in the cash collection environment, given how critical cash is to everybody. We want to be conservative to the payments that are already lined up.", "But again, anticipating with terms of new business activity and other things that there maybe a slowdown or we aren't seeing that detail yet, but as far as forecasting of full year in advance, to start it's prudent to include that. And then again that last element on the collection side is that moderate book-to-bill reduction that we're seeing, that's going to contribute as well.", "On the other hand the disbursement side, while we're holding the operating margins at about 23% for the year. We're committing to higher revenues between 3% and 5.50%. But at the same time of course, expenses will go up, reflecting the full year of Synplicity. So, disbursements being higher, the collection side being down slightly, contributed to that $200 million to $220 million of positive operating cash flow, a very strong number still.", "Tim Fox - Deutsche Bank", "Great. And then CapEx for '09, any sense what that might be at this point?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah. We're forecasting between $30 million and $35 million of cash which is a further reduction of 15% from this year's level which we already reduced the '08 numbers if you like by 13% from the '07 level. So, again just cash is so critical, we've done I think a pretty fair job on taken up that cash during '08 and look forward to conserving that again in '07 from expense management perspective. Watch on the CapEx side and then be able to use that cash for the appropriate investment side, as we go forward.", "Operator", "We have four minutes left for the conference. Our next question will come from the line Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "With the book-to-bill commentary that you make can you give us some idea of the magnitude change in bookings you expect in '09. Do you expect it will be up, flat, down, down double-digits just give us a sense based on that book-to-bill comment?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, normally, we don\u2019t comment on bookings at all as you know. What we give out is at the end, what our backlog looks like for the coming year. And so again I don\u2019t want to get the feeling here and we overstate this discussion point, because the correlation between the bookings and the run-rate is not a simple one at all. As a matter of fact, yeah there are many situations where lowered booking maintains a better run-rate and that is the objective to hold on to. There is lot of uncertainty right now, in terms of what customers want to do and so in many situations we are best off if they don\u2019t do anything that's a matter of fact.", "Now, having said that, our objective is to continue to grow the run-rate for the year, and so we\u2019ll see how the economy holds up for that, but our business outlook not withstanding the landscape around us is actually quiet bullish. We think that we are as strong a position as we've been in many years given the utilization of our tools, the opportunities space compatibly that we have and the strength of the technology.", "And so what you hear, us do here is essentially work against a plan that is built for conservatism. And you see us manage the balance sheet in exactly the same fashion because nobody we talk to can really predict what\u2019s happening in the beginning or in the midst or the end of next year. And so I think we are reasonably well braced for many scenarios and as things turn up that is great. Just nobody knows that that will happen and therefore we are well prepared with the overall plan that we have put in place.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Okay and then Brian, can you give a sense you\u2019ve given us you've given us the revenue guidance and the revenue growth guidance, but what would that guidance be on an organic basis?", "Brian Beattie", "Well those numbers are all inclusive of course reflecting both the impact of the, primarily Synplicity acquisition, but breaking at just organic growth the company over its history has acquired many companies and continued to grow. So we really don't split them out. I think we are being conservative in both organic this does not include any additional M&A opportunities. This is really a forecast of where we see the company growing as we move forward. So 3.2% to over 5.5% is our combined overall revenue growth rates for 2009.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "All right, last question. Aart, there has been a couple of questions about the last time around in terms of the slowdown. One thing the last time around was the concern about shelf ware and what happened with R&D headcount and reductions. Can you give us some commentary in terms of what you are seeing from your standpoint from your customers right now on the headcount side and maybe what you might manage or do differently this time around to minimize the shelf ware issue?", "Aart de Geus", "Sorry, could you clarify what do you mean with shelf ware issue, you mean that demand in the software?", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Sure, well if you've got a 100 engineers at a customer and there are five or ten of them, and you had a 100 licenses there. They are not going to come back and buy more licenses until they get back above 100 engineers in a simplistic fashion?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, now I understand thank you. Well first in terms of people. So far we have not seen major reductions in workforce in the engineering side of things and frankly I think that the first reductions are going to be much more on the production and manufacturing side, because those are things that are really impacted by volume and it invariably tends to be towards the end of any issue that people start to cut into R&D.", "Now having said that, I think there is no question of people will look at which project have a future and will mostly try to sell off the assets that don\u2019t any longer fit their strategy. So, I think we are going to see a number of businesses essentially trading hams more than anything. And invariably the engineers go with that and then it\u2019s a matter of working out the fine points of what happens to the software as they move owner.", "On the software issue, I think that sort of secondary to that first point, meaning that I don\u2019t there is much software right now. Remember that one we came out of the crazy \u201899 and 2000s, where if you just had clicks that were viewed as revenue and that permeated the entire industry. So, people were growing so much, they were just buying on the future. I think that is long gone, as a matter of fact if there is anything that CFO have changed in after \u201801 is that, they are not buying ahead of needs very much.", "Lastly, I think that\u2019s for many of the more modern shaft the utilization of software has dramatically grown up or grown I should say until from that perspective its more a matter of negotiation of how much do you get for the budget that you have available than anything and our objective should be the discussion with customers because that brings us straight back to productivity to how they can simplify their flows and how we can become a more important supplier to them rather than having debates on numbers of copy.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Terence Whalen - Citi", "Thanks. I appreciate you putting me in. This one is just a real simple one on operating margin. Brian, I believe you said with the revenue growth of 32% to 55% in fiscal \u201809 you would expect expenses to be inline or undergo that slightly. Would that mean that operating margin would be slightly upper, I thought you had mentioned maybe operating margin would be down slightly if you could just reconcile those and that's from me.", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, you bet Terence. We are really looking overall at about a flat margin story at a very healthy 23% level right, where we came in for this year. So, we are working around that based on the scenarios for both revenue and expenses, but it's a roughly flat numbers. So, maintaining the profitability levels that we've achieved deal both it can be additional revenue and to be able to invest in those opportunity it's right in front of us to be able to grow for the future here.", "Terence Whalen - Citi", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from the line of K.C. Rajkumar with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. Can you talk to any specific initiatives that you want to see taken and especially seasonal marketing folks to gain customer share, not market share, but customer share at the expense of your main competition.", "Aart de Geus", "Certainly we have a quite a number of very active discussion with customers about the notion of productivity and predictability. Let me distinguish the two, productivity is clearly how you can get as much out as possible for the amount of dollars that you spend. And when I say dollars you spend, I\u2019m not talking just about EDA out of pocket cost, but overall design cost.", "And that is really the key that, that we have to go after, because if we can look at that picture, the way that we can save our customers\u2019 money, while for Synopsys is growing. Secondly on predictability, which is the other, is the time dimension, is that with more and more of the complex chips, people are finding that they have a hard time knowing exactly when the project is finished because their design methodologies a little bit all over the map and need to become more structured, more standardized, and more disciplined. And that of course ties directly to the first topic which is how can you work with fewer vendors to get a better solution.", "And so those dialogues are very, very active right now. And I think that we will see that economic pressure will actually help customers make moves that otherwise, internally are hard to do, because change management is always hard. Whereas, when it becomes economically harder, top down management can actually have more impact and I think we are already starting to see the beginnings of that.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Do you expect the launch of the custom designer tool to help you gain customer share next year, or is it that more of fiscal '10 story?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I think it is a fiscal '09 story and it is obviously, gaining share from virtually zero and specifically the custom-design area. And so there are customers that already have done tape outs with our tools today, which is very encouraging. At the same time, it is also in the much bigger picture which is by virtue of having a more complete solution, we become much more attractive to customers that really have a need of selecting fewer vendors to be economically more viable. And we now have a check mark in that category, as well.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Any quick thoughts on, what is going to be the revenue for following fiscal '09 beyond the first quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, I think we gave earlier guidance and maybe we can take this up in the Q&A session, the individual Q&A interactions. But there is guidance for '09 revenue in the documents I've send out I believe. And so if we can refer you to those, there is a lot more detail there.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Lastly, do you expect the base of 32 nanometer tools to pick up next year?", "Aart de Geus", "I think it has already picked up, because the 32 nanometer chips are already in design, the technologies are being honed for roll out in 2009. As a matter of fact, I am looking at my sheet here that we are, tracking 32 active designs today. We already have a number of tape outs at 32 nanometer and I know that there is a whole bunch of people that are gearing up for making the technology available commercially, pretty much in the second half of '09. So, the technology train hasn't path decelerated at all.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Finally, would you have any quick thoughts on I think you have addressed this earlier. But if one or two point to couple of specific risks which you can anticipate into next year, beyond the usual macro stuff through guidance what could they be?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, it's obvious, that the macroeconomic picture is one of uncertainty that pretty much all of us have never seen so far. Now having said that, both the high-tech field is impacted, but is also crucial within that the semiconductor field is impacted bit even more crucial and I would argue that line of reasoning applies to us as well. So from that perspective, I think continued investment in high-tech will absolutely be a necessity.", "Now the fact is that, when everybody is looking for money, the negotiations are going to be harder than before. People will plead that they need more technology for less money. We should be prepared and we should not be careless about that. I think many of our customers will hurt and we need to be able to a really good partner in that. But at the same time we also provide the very value that allows them to differentiate survive and do well. And so I think we are crucial for that picture.", "Lastly, I expect that in United States within the new administration there will be additional emphasis on high tech and so I think that supports all of the arguments I just made that the semiconductor industry will continue to be very important in the years to come.", "With that I think it\u2019s time to close this earnings release. We appreciate the time that you spent with us. As usual Brian, Lisa and myself available for additional comments and questions right after this. Thank you for all the support in '08. We look forward to your support in '09. Find to be in many ways a very interesting challenging but also high opportunity year for us. And so we appreciate the time you spent with us in this earnings call.

A. Davidson & Co.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Synopsys, Inc. earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. (Operator Instructions)", "At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, [Pamela]. Good afternoon, everyone. ", "With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys, and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. ", "During the course of this consolidated comp store Synopsys may make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company's actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our results are described in our 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2009 and in our earnings release for the second quarter fiscal year 2009 issued earlier today. In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this call as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in our second quarter earnings release and financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at Synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report another quarter of very good execution with solid financial results, strong technology momentum and visible customer successes. Let me begin with our financials. ", "In Q2 we delivered $337 million in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.45, above our target range. We achieved this within our predictable business model with more than 90% time-based revenue. In anticipation of continued economic stress we further tightened our expense management to stay solidly on track with earnings for the year. We exited the quarter with $877 million of cash and no debt.", "Turing to the overall environment, the outlook remains mixed. While we're rebounding off the bottom with inventory rebuilds and some rush orders, the semiconductor industry is expected to experience a 2009 revenue decline in the 20% range. After that, a very gradual recovery lasting into 2011 is a likely scenario although predictions will be greatly impacted by the overall economy. ", "The long-term ramifications of this scenario are only starting to become visible. In addition to some immediate cost cutting to respond to the crisis, most businesses are now refocusing their market strategies, massively streamlining their operations, de-risking their supply and partner relationships, and in a number of cases actively pursuing consolidation opportunities to drive economic efficiencies. The recently announced potential Renesas-NEC merger is a visible case in point.", "Over the next 12 to 24 months the challenge for the semiconductor industry and its suppliers will be to find the next level of efficiency in an overall very weak economy. The good news is that across a broad field of applications semiconductors are a key enable to future prosperity. Drivers range from an extensive green push to the emergence of low-cost netbooks and solid state drives to advances in connectivity, including telepresence, to exciting products such as the evolving Kindle that may completely restructure the publishing industry.", "Meanwhile, our customers are under high stress and we're moderating our revenue expectations as we approach 2010. In Q2 we saw average run rates slightly decrease due in part to several bankruptcies during the first half and we expect the end of the year run rates to be slightly down. As anticipated, many customers are renewing their contracts closer to their expiration dates and we expect bookings for the year to be slightly below our original internal plan. Finally, we continue to see late payments for some customers who are focused on short-term cash conservation.", "In a recession of this magnitude none of these things should be a surprise, and we have already adopted a number of measures to further strengthen our position. I'm happy to report that while we are slightly reducing the revenue rates for the year, we're actually solidifying our earnings per share guidance for '09. We're also moderating our operating cash flow target to reflect a collection environment. Brian will discuss guidance in more detail.", "Given the extraordinary economic situation Synopsys is actually doing very, very well. Our technology position is demonstrably strong, our customer relationships were built for the long term, and we have an intense focus on execution so that we emerge even stronger. Synopsys is steadily gaining customer momentum while continuing to invest in evolving our product portfolio. ", "As customers are aggressively de-risking their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner. Evidence of this is the further extension of our relationships with companies such as Marvell, Toshiba, Tundra and Wolfson. The number of companies who have openly selected Synopsys is further augmented by several sizeable partnerships that have not been publicly identified. The stability of shared visions created in these kinds of deep relationships between vendors and customers will be critical in driving the innovation and technology roadmaps of the future.", "So let me now turn to the essence of our DNA, technology. The need for advanced design goes on unabated. Both the direction and level of our technical investments match well the needs of our customers, and we feel a great sense of momentum in the company. Our strategy is twofold\u00a0- first, to ensure best in class point technology in products. While we can't promise the best in every tool, we always try to do so. Second and even more important is driving best in class overall results through integrated advanced flows, platforms and methodologies that focus on our customers' total cost of design.", "2008 was a prolific year for Synopsys. We introduced significant new products such as Zroute, recipient of this year's EDN innovation award for design, and Custom Designer, our long-awaited entry into analog implementation. 2009 is continuing the steady delivery of new products and capabilities ranging from systems to silicon. ", "In verification, the number one pain point for customers, we building on our strength in both analog and digital with several advances in Q2, including Custom Sim for unified analog simulation, which combines the speed and accuracy of what used to be three separate tools into a single flexible easy to deploy solution. We also delivered multi-core technology in DCS functional simulator, resulting in a 2x speedup. In implementation we introduced an exciting new physical verification solution that integrates manufacturing information and analysis into the design process.  ", "A companion to IC Compiler, IC Validator is architected for 45 nanometer and below designs and includes advanced features such as a brand-new engine driving greater performance, unmatched scalability with multi-core CPUs and an architecture permitting easy design corrections within IC Compiler. IC Validator has already been adopted by companies such as technology heavyweight Invidia and Toshiba.  ", "Our implementation flow is excelling at the most advanced 32 and 28 nanometer designs and our work with customers at these nodes is proceeding very well. ", "With the broad objective of increasing design productivity and predictability, at our user's group in March we launched our new open design system Lynx. Lynx is architected for easy adoption by both mainstream and advanced users and it's aimed at systematizing design for efficiency through a lower risk [soundly ready] path from design to silicon. With production-proven design flows and methodologies for 65 nanometer and below, Lynx enables out-of-the-box functionality without costly CAD infrastructure spending, helping our customers reduce their total cost of design. Not surprisingly, we're already had several adoptions of Lynx, even at this early stage. ", "As a side note, our San Jose user's group was the best attended in Synopsys' history, attesting to the high level of interest in what we have to offer.", "Turning to our strategic investments, I'd like to highlight two today - Custom Design and IP. Our new analog mixed signal design solution Custom Designer is generating a lot of interest and is on track for general availability next month. Customers have been impressed not only with a viable alternative to the incumbent but also by the functional and ease of use features in Custom Designer that surpass other offerings. ", "In the IP space, the recession is accelerating the build versus buy decisions that many customers go through as they streamline their operations for efficiency and differentiation. Purchasing commercial high-quality IP is a good way to save on development costs and to focus one's own designers on the most critical and differentiating portions of a design. During the quarter we expanded our offering with the acquisition of the analog business group of MIPS Technologies. This acquisition adds a new analog IP product line, including data converters, audio codecs and video [inaudible] and complements our portfolio of interface IP with HDMI products. ", "To conclude, even with the turbulent environment around us, Synopsys again executed well in Q2. We have technology momentum and are seeing significant commitments by key customers to work with us going forward. We are practically balancing technical investments and careful expense controls. Overall, we expect to weather the recession well. We're clearly building for the opportunities waiting in the recover. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone.", "In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We provided reconciliations in the press release and the financial supplement, which is posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "As Aart discussed, we're continuing to manage the business well in what is a difficult economic environment. We delivered solid second quarter results highlighted by top and bottom line growth, strong operating margin, and we exited the quarter in a healthy financial position with $877\u00a0million in cash and no debt.", "Total revenue increased 4% to $336.8 million, within our target range, with greater than 90% of Q2 revenue coming from beginning of quarter backlog. While our Software results remain solid, the slow economy has understandably affected both our Consulting and Hardware businesses as customers continue to focus on reducing costs. This has resulted in some pressure on our Consulting engagements and some delays in Hardware purchases during the quarter. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue.", "Now turning to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $282.2 million, which included $10.6\u00a0million of amortization of intangible assets and $14.7 million of share-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $253.1 million, an expected year-over-year increase due mainly to our Simplicity acquisition, but below our target range due to company wide cost controls and timing of quarterly expenses. For all of 2009 we expect total costs and expenses to increase slightly less than our targeted revenue growth rate. ", "As we prepare for an uncertain economic outlook for the balance of 2009 and 2010, we implemented broad cost savings initiatives focusing on vendor and contractor costs, compensation and headcount-related expenses, capital expenditures and discretionary spend, including travel and marketing events. ", "These actions will increase our flexibility to more efficiently manage our expenses to our moderating revenue expectations in this difficult environment. Note also however that while we're managing costs diligently, we intend to fully fund our strategic growth areas, drive product innovation, and expand our technology leadership to emerge from these challenging times as an even more successful company.", "Continuing on with our key operating metric, non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8% during the quarter and 25.7% for the first half of fiscal 2009. While the timing depends on how the environment improves, we remain committed to our longer-term operating margin target of mid to high 20s. ", "By proactively aligning expenses with revenue we were able to deliver Q2 earnings above the target ranges we provided at the outset of the quarter. GAAP earnings per share was $0.33 while non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.45. Earnings outperformance was driven primarily by top line growth and expense management along with higher-than-expected other income.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.1% for the quarter. For modeling purposes, we think that a 27% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for the full year. ", "Our revenue visibility remains strong, with 95% coming from backlog. Upfront revenue was 5% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%. ", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 3.4\u00a0years. ", "Now as you know from our previous disclosures, we've been involved in a tax dispute with the IRS regarding our 2002 to 2004 tax returns primarily associated with issues related to our acquisition of Avanti. We're pleased to report that during the quarter we reached a tentative settlement with the IRS Examination Division that would resolve this dispute. The settlement is subject to further approval by the government, which we expect will take at least several more months, but as of today we believe that a settlement is likely. ", "If approved, we would expect the settlement to result in cash payments of approximately $50 million over the next 12\u00a0months. This will be fully offset by a reduction in tax payments in future years. We also expect that the settlement would finally permit certain tax refund claims of around $35\u00a0million from other years to be paid to the company in 2010. ", "We reiterate that if the settlement becomes final, we are adequately reserved for these items, so no material P&L impact. The tentative settlement is not included in our 2009 operating cash flow forecast.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items, in the current environment cash continues to be an area of focus for us and our strong balance sheet provides us with significant financial flexibility. We ended the quarter with $877 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt, an amount that translates into approximately $6.00 per share in cash. Of this balance, 52% is held within the United States. ", "Operating cash flow was $24.7 million in Q2. We expect higher cash generation in the second half of our fiscal year principally driven by the expected annual payment from a large customer in our third fiscal quarter. However, at this time we feel it's prudent to slightly moderate our FY\u00a0'09 operating cash flow target to approximately $170 to $190 million due primarily to less-than-planned scheduled collections for the balance of '09. ", "This slightly lower level is driven primarily by three factors - first, continued late payments from some of our customers; second, bookings coming in slightly below expectations for the year and the timing of these bookings; and third, we're being conservative in our cash collection assumptions given the uncertain economic environment.", "Now continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $6.5\u00a0million in the quarter. For the full year we expect to reduce capital spending by 15% over last year to approximately $30 to $35 million. We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $210 million remaining on our current authorization. As always, we'll evaluate the best use of cash each quarter, including company operations, investments and stock repurchases at the time. We value the flexibility that our cash provides. ", "Now as Aart highlighted, we're excited to have closed the acquisition of the analog business group of MIPS Technologies earlier this month. It was an all-cash deal for approximately $22\u00a0million, funded from our U.S. cash balance. We expect the transaction to be approximately $0.04\u00a0dilutive to non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2009, but we will absorb that dilution and are even increasing the bottom end of our EPS guidance. We currently expect the acquisition to be neutral to slightly accretive in fiscal 2010. ", "Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $189.1 million and DSOs were 51 days, slightly up from last year and well within our target range. ", "Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $588.5 million. ", "We ended Q2 with approximately 5,700 employees. This was an expected year-over-year increase due primarily to our Simplicity acquisition and basically flat headcount to the first quarter. ", "Now moving on to our guidance, for the third quarter of FY '09 our targets are revenue between $342 and $350\u00a0million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $284.5 and $300\u00a0million, which includes approximately $14 million of share-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $261 and $271 million; other income and expense between zero and $3\u00a0million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between 144 and 149\u00a0million; GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.31 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.40 to $0.42 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2009 outlook. Based on what we know now, we expect revenue of approximately $1.35 to $1.38\u00a0billion; other income and expense between $14 and $18 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between 144 and 149\u00a0million; GAAP earnings per share, $1.11 and $1.26, which includes the impact of approximately $58 million in share-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.62 to $1.72. We've increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.02 despite the slight dilution from our acquisition of the analog business group from MIPS Technologies. ", "We continue to target a 23% non-GAAP operating margin for the full year and as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of $170 to $190 million, which does not include any impact from our tentative tax settlement with the IRS. ", "In summary, we've completed a good quarter and we're continuing to execute against our earnings targets in this ongoing challenging environment.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Raj Seth - Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company", "Aart, I may have missed this; I got on late. Did you make any comment about how fiscal Q2 bookings came in and can you talk a little bit about whether or not - I know the environment still is tough - but have you seen a material change from last quarter or the same general environment?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay, it's a complex question because let me start with the same general environment. I would argue that the general environment has not fundamentally changed with the exception of obviously many of the semiconductor companies seeing some, quote, \"bounce,\" off the bottom, which was first was attributed to inventory that has to be replenished, now is being viewed as really the market trying to find a little bit more stable state and that stable state is not minus 38%, which is where it was a quarter ago, but is more likely to end up in the minus 20% state or so for the year. ", "And so in that sense the free fall is over for right now unless there's another major economic disturbance and people are really starting to look forward to where is the industry now going and how long will the recovery be. And in general the scenarios that I hear - and [inaudible] the one that we use from a management point of view - is to just assume that it will then take probably a couple of years to come back to the levels that it used to be in the middle of '08, let's say. ", "Within that we have clearly seen that we actually had a very good quarter. Overall as we look at the entire year, we communicated that we think that our bookings will be slightly below what we had planned, but [inaudible] as the plans were, you know, done in mid '08 so there's a lot of changes there. ", "And, by the way, the bookings themselves are less relevant as maybe the run rate, which is slightly down going forward. And that is also moderated by the fact that there's just been a few bankruptcies, a few people that are just very cautious right now.", "If I were to summarize it, we actually feel that we are in an extraordinarily strong position as a company and that the magnitude of the recession is very deep and that it's only now that many companies are planning how are they going to behave and restructure the industry going forward. And in that situation I think we're in a very good position, but we are well aware that many companies are still very stressed. ", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company", "", "Given the fact that 2010, certainly the top line, will be driven in large part by what you do from a bookings perspective this year - your model's a little bit unique - any initial thoughts on 2010 assuming you execute on your revised booking objectives in 2009. Is 2010, are you planning for a growth year on the revenue line, first? Anything you say on 2010 would be appreciated.", "And maybe, Brian, you could touch on the license duration increase in the quarter.", "Aart de Geus", "", "I think it's a bit too early to give guidance to 2010 because there's so many moving parts in the industry. I think that the fact that the overall run rate is down slightly is a piece of what we will take into account as we plan 2010, but there also are many things that we can still do. ", "And the other thing is that we are certainly solidifying many relationships with customers that today wouldn't dream of spending more, but as business returns or as they find their new stability point will look at how can they improve their differentiation and efficiency. And so we do think that from that perspective we are in a very strong long-term position. But as I said in my preamble, I think that the return of the semiconductor industry - or, as a matter of fact, of the entire economy - is going to take more than just six months.", "Brian Beattie", "Raj, [inaudible] on the contract length as well. It was 3.4 years in the average contract length we closed in the quarter, and it gave us a good perspective based on the amount of activity we saw about just how the quarter went, you know? But we put that in the context of a real tough recession out there and it really just depends on the customer, the requirement for the software, the timing and expansion of the agreements they have. ", "And it averaged 3.4; last quarter it was 2.7. I think in the long run it's very, very close to the three years that we've set out for ourselves and that is the length of our agreement, but just during this recession you're going to see a number of contracts - maybe shorter, a number may be even longer\u00a0 it's just given it's such a unique situation out there, that's really what I'd highlight.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Matthew Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Matthew Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Aart, you referred to maybe not wanting to talk about bookings as much as run rate this year. Are you referring to run rate as far as it means inflows of new orders or run rate in terms of your run rate in individual customer; maybe across the board all your customers are using less of your software? ", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Matt, for starters, our customers are using more of our software, that's for sure, and that's a good sign. But it's also clear that right now customers cannot spend more. I mean, going to any customer today and say hey, we want more money is just a ridiculous proposition in the midst of a massive recession. ", "At the same time though we want to make sure that we maintain a healthy ongoing business profile and for that we use the term run rate. And you're absolutely right; we are thinking about those from customer to customer. ", "The reason I've always cautioned about looking at just orders as the reflector is precisely,  following up on the answer Brian just gave, which is from one quarter to another you can have the number of years go from 2.7 to 3.4 and that's a big difference in orders, but may have no change whatsoever in run rate. And so the very fact that there will be big fluctuations is a given in this landscape. ", "We are managing it very much around the center of gravity of about three years because that's a way that we think to balance our business. ", "Matthew Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "", "Okay, now if, as you stated and I probably agree, your customers are using over time more of your software but they're not paying more, what levers do you have to get paid more?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, you know, I think that's a correct observation today and, you know, many customers will be very eloquent in formulating that we need to help them right now through this downturn because if we do over time we'll do better, and we partially agree with that.", "At the same time, though, it is right now that we are building a set of relationships with these customers that are moving, I think, quite far beyond the traditional just selling them software. As a matter of fact, most of our customers, principally driven by the recession, are forced or see the opportunity to revisit their own productivity and predictability model. ", "And that is perfect for us because for the last few years we've been aiming - aside of trying to have the best possible products\u00a0 to aim at getting the best possible overall results at the best overall design cost. And so focusing on total design costs with the customer is the way we are engaging today, and I think with that comes the opportunity, as they become financially more able to pay more and to be back in business, to really play with us going forward.", "And so we are really strengthening our position notwithstanding the fact that in the midst of a deep recession you don't go to your customers and say hey, I'm going to charge you more.", "Matthew Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "", "And then sort of in conjunction with this question, Brian, I'm wondering if any changes have been made to the deals that you are signing today in terms of maybe some of the cash collection terms as well as whether or not you're able to command as much in the way of bundled maintenance in a given contract?", "Brian Beattie", "Okay, sure. The bundled maintenance, by far - by far - the majority of our business activity are the term licenses taken over time, right, our time-based license agreements, so therefore all of the maintenance is bundled into that. There's a very small amount of perpetual licenses where actually maintenance is charged separately. Those are typically, you know, three or four-year-old deals that were struck awhile back, so it's basically embedded and that is built into the pricing levels.", "When we look at - the first part of the question was around which part?", "Matthew Petkun - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "", "Just timing of cash collection.", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. The payments are up slightly from what we had scheduled earlier. We track each one of them relative to how much cash is due in the first year, second year or third year of the agreement. It's up a little bit. And, again, on a case-by-case basis, as we're looking at the customers going through some of their challenges, we track the payments specifically against their due dates and considering to match that. ", "But, again, at this quarter we hit 51 days of DSOs. That's well within our range. We have very detailed files, analysis, risk ratings, etc., on the credit positions of each of our customers. And finally really don't take revenue until we have a guarantee that the cash is going to come in. We've almost written off no revenues at all in our history and it's very carefully and conservatively managed relative to the cash payments. ", "But, you know, that's why with a slight decrease in our cash outlook it's just really recognizing it's a real challenging environment out there with all companies relative to their cash. And we're still in great shape and just moderating it a little bit.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Richard Valera - Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "I'd like to follow up on the run rate discussion. Aart, excluding the couple of bankruptcies you referred to, how was the run rate? Was it nearly flat? ", "Then sort of a follow up as well to the discussion on primary vendor agreements, I'm just wondering what your historical track record is with increasing run rates when you sign a primary vendor agreement and how that's, you know, played out over the last couple you've signed here during this downturn.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, I think the summary is actually the whole story, which is it's nearly flat. And so there are some people that can afford an increase; there's some people that beg for a decrease. But on average we're doing very well, I would say, with that. That's why I'm saying it's a good indicator to be a little bit careful to not expect huge increases out of customers at a moment where they just can't afford to commit to that, but at the same time we are very bullish on the position that we're building with a number of customers and we think that the very fact that we can provide a strong solution that is aimed at helping their overall cost equation while not having to charge more for it today is very attractive to our customers. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "", "And just the other part of the question with respect to the primary vendor agreements, you know, what's your - I would assume historically that's implied an increase in run rate, if you can confirm if that's true, and then what has been your experience recently? Has it been more of a flattish run rate despite signing one of these primary deals?", "Aart de Geus", "I think your characterization is correct. I would actually not say that there is such a big difference from where it was historically to where it is today. It is very often the case that the primary agreement is really around the core of the technology that people need no matter what, and then there are opportunities to upsell from there as we solidify our position and there are opportunities for our customers to reduce their cost bases by essentially focusing on fewer vendors that provide a more complete solution. ", "And so, you know, the fact that somebody becomes one of our primary EDA partners has many other relationship ramifications that really, I think, bode well for the long term going forward, but they include to be able to sell them more capability.", "Now the objective is not here to reduce our total available market; the objective is to increase it. But it's also clear that the technical complexity and the interaction level needed to be successful has gone up and therefore working well with these customers bodes well, I think, for both them, most importantly, and hopefully for us as the business picture clarifies going forward. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "", "And then a couple of questions on the guidance. I guess this is for you, Brian. You have a $30\u00a0million delta in your full year revenue guidance with only two quarters to go, which seems like a quite big range given the predictability of your model would seem to imply to get to the low end you'd need to do almost no perpetual revenue, it would seem, or upfront revenue. So question number one, you know, why such a big range with only two quarters to go?", "And number two, if you take your nine-month EPS, year-to-date EPS, and back that away from your full year guidance, it looks like you're looking for $0.25 to $0.35 in the fourth quarter. I'm trying to understand why that EPS number is so low in the fourth quarter. Is that a new run rate or is there some unusual expenses in the fourth quarter relative to, say, the third quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "Okay, a good question. ", "On the range itself, I think, again, we're one of those companies that does provide guidance; a lot of people have kind of looked at it. And we wanted to give a range that, as we've traditionally done, keeps us within the boundaries of what we set out. So in a way you might call that conservative revenue. And really relative to the trend that we're seeing on revenues, it keeps moving along, you know? There's no anticipation of any major surprises. It's just tough out there, you know? We're just watching the credit; we're watching the situations with any consolidations happening amongst the semiconductor players and other activities going on.", "But you're right, we're highly predictable. We just have, you know, our traditional wider range. And we only have two quarters left to go, so I just locked that into being a conservative position on it but still feeling very confident that we're going to get through this within those ranges. ", "You know, as I look ahead then to Q3 and Q4, it's really just, again, the expense timing relative to when those costs come in, relative variable compensation, which for us typically picks up towards the third and fourth quarter relative to the performance metrics that we've established for the company, and we have higher levels of confidence as we move towards the end of the year. ", "And so I think, again, it's just a pretty good profile that has allowed us to maintain our operating margins, to increase, even with the $0.04 dilution from the new acquisition, to actually increase the bottom end of that earnings guidance and come out for the year real tight against what we set up initially in an extremely tough environment. ", "So we're pretty proud of the expense management and delivering the revenues as we expected to get on the EPS numbers. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "", "If I could just ask that a little bit of a different way, the fourth quarter, assuming you did flattish sequential revenue from the third quarter, which would be within your guidance, the lower EPS would be due, it sounds like, to higher commissions, perhaps, and maybe some incremental dilution from the MIPS deal. Are those the two main contributors?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, those are both contributors and beyond just the commission piece, but the whole variable compensation, which goes beyond just the sales team. And, again, as we deliver, we'll be accruing those expenses against our performance metrics for the year. So it really just builds up. And again, trying to be, you know, conservative in the expense outlook and, again, prepare us for 2010 to get our expenses as low as we can leading in. And it's a typical fourth quarter for us relative to the profile that we see every single year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "So the first question is, when I look at the jump in the average duration, you know, if we look at the industry as a whole there have been periods in the past where some vendors, when you saw a jump in duration, it was because the environment was tough and it was because of increased discounting. Can you give just some description based on what's happening in pricing and discounting because, you know, the predictability of your model, I thought that was kind of the alleviation of having to give in to some of the pressures. ", "Aart de Geus", "Certainly. First, on duration, you know, one of the reasons I'm always hesitant should we release this on a quarter-by-quarter basis is because it's not meaningful data mostly. The running average is far more meaningful, which are really around about three years.", "Now sometimes people want to have a longer duration because they essentially want to lock in pricing and feel that in a relationship they don't want to be feeling subject to price changes when things move on. There's a positive for us in that in that people commit to us. On the other hand we may argue the opposite, which is, say, you know, shorter durations are better because now is not the time to ask for premium pricing and locking it in for too long is a negative.", "And so the bottom line of all of that is I think we are very cognizant of the dynamics in both dimensions and that is the very reason that in the last four or five years we've actually been, I think, extremely systematic to keep it sort of at roughly the same average.", "Now having said that, there's no question that a number of customers right now are shifting their decision-making to be more encompassing about some of the relationships they're going into, and they are seeing that the complexity of design is demanding a degree of integration of the tools but also of the integration of the interaction between user and supplier that is different from the past to be successful. ", "And a number of companies are absolutely de-risking their profile of suppliers that they're using. That is a benefit for us. I think we are a safe bet. I think we're better than a safe bet. We have a number of technologies that will help them going forward. And so the discussions about the length of the deals are not difficult. It is really sort of what makes sense, what's the timeline of what they have already running with us, and a little bit a feel for how do you minimize the degree of anxiety on both sides. ", "So the length of the deal is a non-event in the negotiation. It's not something we're pushing or pulling one way or another.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "And then can you describe a little bit the linearity of the bookings through the quarter because you mentioned kind of the improvement in terms of the inventory refresh and there's been some discussions about layoffs possibly mitigating. So can you just talk about what you saw in terms of the linearity of bookings?", "Aart de Geus", "You know, I think at the beginning of the quarter we already had a pretty good sense of what business was actionable and it fundamentally didn't change all that much during the quarter. Now part of that is many of the companies we deal with are well aware that they have to do cuts or that the future is uncertain, but they're also very well aware that they need to have a strong set of relationships with their key suppliers to stay in business and do well. ", "And so the very fact that certainly initially in the downturn we saw people be very nervous making any commitments, just sort of putting it on hold and given that many deals are three-year deals that still have some time to run, there was no super urgency, I think we reported that first quarter orders were very low compared to the second quarter, which was essentially normal. And so I think we're sort of back to normal business in a still very not-normal economy. ", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "And Brian, I got the $0.04 dilution from the acquisition, but I missed if you said it\u00a0- did you actually tell us what the revenue contribution expected and what the revenue model on the acquisition looks like?", "Brian Beattie", "No. No, I didn't say that, so you didn't miss anything. What we said was it's not material to our next year and that we thought in 2010 the impact of this latest acquisition would be slightly accretive on balance. You know, we typically go through haircuts on deferred revenues and things like that. So don't see it as a major item, you know? We're factoring that, of course, into the guidance and expenses and revenue for the balance of '09, and everything we said includes those metrics. ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Do you guys feel that the EDS spend by your customers, customer spend, has actually lagged the other cuts they made in other segments? ", "And as a follow up, even if the semi customers' revenue declined for this year, it's not going to get any worse. Do you feel that the EDS spending cuts might actually [accelerate] as we go to the [inaudible]?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think there are two comments to that. First, by definition they're lagging because many of our agreements are multi-year agreements and so, with the exception of customers that essentially go completely out of business, where you would feel the effect immediately, for most of the other customers, aside of the pleading for help, there's not much that occurs.", "Now having said that, going forward as some of the customers re-look at their relationships, sign up some primary vendor relationships, I think we will see some shift in spending. But on the positive side, there's no question that as many customers have gotten more and more out of manufacturing and are paying more and more attention to differentiation in design, there's an opportunity for us to really have impact there. ", "One of the reasons I mentioned earlier why I'm so enthusiastic about some of these key relationships is because we're essentially strengthening a long-term relationship around the core offering of the company, but there's opportunity to upsell from there once their economic outlook starts to brighten up. And there's no question that from a technology necessity they will need a lot more technology. So the opportunity's there.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Since the start of the downturn, can you characterize how many new relationships have you guys locked up, either with customers whom you did not do much business with or selling new tool sets to old customers? ", "And as a follow up, my impression from your answers to previous questions was that whereas so far you haven't seen a distinct increase in the contract size. Even when you increase the size of the relationship with the customer, you are hoping to do better with customers as the economy picks up. ", "Aart de Geus", "Well, there are many questions in your question. Let me start with new customers. There are very few truly new customers, you know, partially because today we touch virtually every electronics company in the world. And as you can imagine, the number of startups right now is rather limited and the number of people that are going to spend a lot of money from scratch is essentially nil.", "Having said that, there have been a few startups and there have been a few companies that we've gotten into because of the interest via some of the new IP, via some of the prototyping capabilities, so there some of the new products that we have are finding traction in places that before we didn't necessarily touch.", "Now regarding the main players, which are really the big companies where we seek to have profound long-term relationships, in general I would say that the spending overall has not really gone up because there's no way they're going to spend more right now at the very time where they're trying to cut costs in many dimensions. ", "At the same time, though, it's also not practical for them to just cut the costs because they are either in existing contracts or they have a very real need for all of our products and we're not going to give our value away for free. ", "And so I think the joint objective for both of these crucial customers in the industry and ourselves is to say how do we both work on a better future and the better future absolutely says how do we make you more efficient from a true overall productivity and predictability point of view. In other words, you know, let's put a dent in cost of design because that will make them more competitive; that will make us more relevant to them. ", "And in that context, for example, we introduced a very exciting product, Lynx, which is essentially a design flow that has been enabled for the customer to over time start really optimizing for productivity.", "And so it's a different level of interaction with them already and I think all of those things really bode well and we are essentially investing for post-recession, if you can call it like that. ", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "", "On the matter of the lower bookings run rate, can you comment on how much of the lower run rate is the cause of company bankruptcies and how much of it is because of a slightly lower average contract size of the surviving companies?", "Aart de Geus", "I don't know the exact number; it's probably about half or something like that, rough numbers. And yes, there have been a number of bankruptcies. I can't say that that is, you know, overwhelming the picture. That would not be correct. ", "Maybe the other aspect that has seen some marked pressure is the services and that's not really a surprise because, you know, if you are a company where the mandate comes top down cut costs, what does everybody do? The first thing they do is to look at anybody who's not employed in the company and cut their service or their short-term contract.", "So actually we've seen a slight rebound on that this quarter. Again, let's not overemphasize these things. I think we're in the noisy phase of a recession turning into a recovery, and the very reason we communicate a certain degree of caution is because we've seen these before and when people hit bottom they make it sound as if, you know, the end of the tunnel is here. I think the reality is the recession will take some time to work out. But knowing that reality, I think we can really take advantage of it for the long term. ", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "", "And lastly, what's going to be the earning model for the analog IP that you guys acquired from MIPS, upfront or would that also be subscription based?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the IP is more upfront than certainly the software because in the vast majority of the situations it's essentially a perpetual license with some restrictions. So the perpetual license may be only for a project or only for a product family or only for some period of time, but essentially it is, in simple terms, you get paid when it gets delivered. So in that sense most of what comes out of the new acquisition will probably follow exactly the same profile.", "The other comment I would like to make is, you know, what we are taking there, which is, I think, there's some fabulous technology in that acquisition, but we want to make really, really sure that it also fits the Synopsys quality profile. One of the reasons that we have built, I think, such a good IP franchise is because we have really over invested in verification with our IP, which is really necessary. And so it will take a little bit of time to fully absorb this into Synopsys. ", "But we're very excited about it because it also ties well to our rollout of Custom Designer, which is, of course, the other area that is very exciting because it's an area that, on the analog implementation, we had no position, and so, you know, that means there's only upside there.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "How would you characterize - I think we talked at the end of last fiscal year coming into this fiscal year that you had on a relative basis a little bit weaker renewal opportunity set, at least in the beginning of the fiscal year. How would you characterize the amount of business that\u2019s coming up for renewal in the coming couple of quarters and when do we get to a point where maybe the renewal opportunity starts to improve to help offset some of the economic malaise that we're in?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, if you don't mind, let me just disagree with your premise. The number of people that keep talking about renewal cycles is just amazing because, you know, to us that is not the key driver to our business. The key driver is the renewals are spread over roughly three years and the renewals tend to be about three years. And so if a renewal is early a quarter or two or later a quarter or two, it has no impact on the revenue whatsoever.", "However, there are some changes if you renew earlier or later which is can you sell additional capabilities, can you change the relationship and so on, and what we see is that in a time of high uncertainty, such as right now, different companies react differently. There's some people that immediately stop thinking about renewals because they have so many other challenges; there are other companies that think now is the time to cut a deal and maybe it's cheaper, and yet other companies that think hey, you know, now is the time to really re-think strategically where we want to be in two to three years, who will be our key partners and how do we make sure that we have both safety in our relationships but also a highly leveraged relationship going forward?", "And we see all of those and that's why all these talks about renewals and length of deal tend to be so noisy. But the principles are very basic, old school business principles. ", "So understanding that reasonably well, we've taken an approach of saying well, let's be with the customer on their most fundamental question, which is how do they over the next two years improve their business picture by becoming on one hand more streamlined economically, on the other hand, more competitive with additional differentiation. That is the dialogue that we have with all the people that we have now these broader relationships with, and it gradually morphs how we think about our own mission, notwithstanding that on a day-to-day basis we'll fight to create the best possible individual product.", "So I don't actually even know that there would be any difference in renewal numbers or key pieces from one year to another, the exception being one or two companies that tend to be very large, but even there there's a high degree of variability.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "Right. But I think the reason that we still focus on it is while it may not matter dramatically to the revenue run rate as you spread it out, it does give an indication or it has an impact on cash flow, at least in the recent past, given how you guys collect. Cash flow is also an important valuation metric in the sector. The question is, you know, if you get to a point where some of the renewals pick up, you know, maybe we see cash flow moving in the other direction; that could point to improved health. ", "Aart de Geus", "Actually, Sterling, you make an excellent point. I hadn't thought about that. But your point is absolutely correct. And actually you can see - one additional reason why people sometimes don't want to make any moves because they don't want to, you know, engage any cash at the moment where they're holding it as much as they can. ", "But your point is actually well taken and I had not thought about it that way. ", "Operator", "", "And presenters, we'll turn the conference back over to you at this time.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, thank you for attending this earnings release. As usual, Brian and I will be available for some comments and clarification afterwards. ", "We do think that we are in a very, very good position in a very unique time environment, and we're actually quite excited about the momentum of the company. And hopefully we were able to give you an objective and balanced perspective of both the market and our situation.", "Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode.  Later we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session, instructions will be given at that time.  (Operator Instructions)  Today\u2019s call will last one hour.  Five minutes prior to the end of the call, I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference.  As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations.  ", "Lisa L. Ewbank", "", "With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.  During the course of this conference call, Synopsys may make forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.  ", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, the company\u2019s actual results and performance are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight in this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our 10Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2009 and in our earnings release for the third quarter or fiscal year 2009 issued earlier today.  In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in our third quarter earnings release and financial supplement.  All of these items are currently available on our website at www.Synopsys.com.  With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "I\u2019m happy to report that we again made excellent progress towards our year\u2019s objective.  In Q3 we demonstrated solid financial results, substantial technology advances and continued customer momentum.  Summarizing our financial results we delivered above targets non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 with $345 million in revenue.  We achieved this within our predictable business model with more than 90% time based revenue.  We continued our focus on cost control and we exited the quarter with a very strong cash position.  ", "Turning to the economic environment around us, we see that bankruptcies have subsided, that inventory corrections are driving in increasing activities, and most importantly that the natural level of consumption is gradually stabilizing the semiconductor market.  That said forecasts are now on average that our customers will end 2009 with revenue down about 15% to 20%.  While semiconductor executives are cautious in a still uncertain economy and expect a gradual recovery lasting into 2011.  ", "Accordingly, at Synopsys we are planning for continued industry stress through 2010 although we see a great opportunity to further strengthen our competitive position as customers focus on the best, most reliable long term options.  Given this backdrop, we have assertively managed our business to not only adapt to the downturn but also take full advantage of it.  Expense controls are offsetting marginally weaker revenue.  We are driving long term segment share shifts with customers moving to us and we continue to make aggressive technology investments all focused on reducing our customer\u2019s total cost of design.", "For fiscal \u201809 the result is that we\u2019ve been able to adjust expenses to offset slightly reduced revenue expectations and provide earnings in excess of our original targets for the year.  We\u2019re also increasing our operating cash flow forecast to reflect the improved customer collections environment.  We expect to exit this fiscal year with a slightly down revenue run rate.  From an orders point of view, contracts are now renewing closer to the end of their duration as customers are still cautiously delaying their decisions.  Contract length though, remains stable.  While durations fluctuate a bit from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to see the average range around three years.  ", "Behind our customer\u2019s trust and commitment to Synopsys lies the recognition that we\u2019re providing them several clear advantages.  First, a continuing stream of technology advances.  This quarter we again delivered substantial new capabilities to our customers.  Second, a global support organization that materially impacts the success of IP design as we help customers achieve better chip sizes, speed, power, yield and most importantly, meet difficult schedules.  And third, an intense focus on the total cost of design, which can be considerably improved by integrated EDA solutions with links to manufacturing, systems and sophisticated IP blocks.", "Each key semiconductor company such as Exar, Intel, Marvell, National Semiconductor, Panasonic, Renesas, Toshiba, Wolfson, and others are counting on us to be their primary EDA partner as they drive forward the product that will carry them out of the recession.  Technology leadership is critical in this equation and in truth we again delivered great new value to our customers.  Starting with our Galaxy Implementation Platform, we introduced brand new in design physical verification capability with IC Validator.  This is remarkable as the in design integration lets customers diagnose and fix issues during place in route long before final signout, thus minimizing disastrous schedule delays.", "In June, we also shipped a complete new Galaxy release with extended core features throughout the flow and enhanced low power performance.  Our customers are seeing notable success.  Insignia for example, used IP Compiler to tape out the lead product of their high performance, automotive microcontroller platform.  At the recent Design Automation Conference, several customers including Toshiba, Renesas, and Samsung described the excellent results using Galaxy and the in design capability integrating IC Compiler with synthesis, signoff, and physical verification.  ", "Our goal is for these successes to result in segment share gain and while shifts occur gradually, I can tell you that we\u2019re actively replacing competitors at a number of important customers.  The central theme remains the same technology differentiation and risk reduction.  One effort that precisely fits that description is collaboration we announced last month with our ARM and the IBM/Samsung chartered common platform.  Together we are developing a comprehensive new solution for high volume mobile applications at 32 nanometer.  The target integration of advanced rough processors, connectivity IP, manufacturing technology and a state of the art design flow will be instrumental in reducing cost and time to market.  ", "Turning to verification, our discovery release also included many new advanced features in both digital and analog.  In Q3, we\u2019re released CustomSim for unified analog simulation.  It combines the speed and accuracy of what used to be three separate tools into a single, flexible, easy to deploy solution.  We delivered multi core technology in our core of VCS functional simulator resulting in a 2X speed up.  Given that the simulator is used in the majority of the advanced chips in the world, a speed up of this magnitude has major economic impact as customers are able to reduce expenses for costly computer hardware. ", "Turning to our strategic investments, we continue to see excellent progress in both analog mix signal implementation and in our IP systems space.  Custom Designer, our new analog mixed signal design solution went into general availability in June with two major new features, schematic driven layout and an advanced analog simulation environment.  Customers can now complete full analog mixed signal design using only Synopsys as evidenced by two tape outs in the quarter.  Interest has been significant with requests for demos and evaluations exceeding our capacity to fully handle at the moment.  ", "To support the deployment of technology molds through open standards, TSMC announced the availability of the first 65 nanometer interoperable process design kit or iPDK for short.  The iPDKs are based on the open access standards and works seamlessly in our products.  Moreover, TSMC also announced that they have chosen Custom Designer as their iPDK development and validation platform.", "Moving to our IP business, last quarter\u2019s acquisition of the analog business group of MIPS has generated great feedback from our customers.  The integration is right on track and added a rich library of analog IP as well as HTMI connectivity cores.  We continue to do well in this business and again introduced significant new products in Q3 including several connectivity titles and key power optimization IP.", "In addition, we were the first company to achieve certification for a USB analog [inaudible] of 32 nanometer.  Finally, tying it all together at the high end, our systems solution is also progressing well.  At DAC we demonstrated our newly integrated virtual platform an FPGA based rapid prototyping solution developed to accelerate embedded software development.  Customer reaction to our technology momentum has been extraordinary.  ", "During the quarter, we had a record breaking user group attendance at a number of events.  Most notably was well over 2,000 attendees in our India meeting alone.  In summary, Synopsys continues to execute well amid the uncertainty around us, we\u2019re actively working with customers to help them successfully navigate the recovery and in turn are positioning ourselves for even greater strength in the future.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "In my comments today I\u2019ll summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our 2009 guidance.  As a reminder, I\u2019ll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance.  And we\u2019ve provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement which is posted on our website.  In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.  Now as Aart highlighted, Q3 financial results were solid.  We delivered bottom line growth, expanded non-GAAP operating margins and generated considerable operating cash flow.  ", "Let me now provide some additional details on our financials.  Total revenue was $345.2 million within our target range and with greater than 90% of our Q3 revenue coming from beginning of quarter backlog.  Our IP and systems business performed particularly well this quarter driven primarily by our digital and analog IP course.  This of course includes the very small revenue portion from our acquisition of the analog business group from MIPS Technologies.  Even excluding this transaction, business was quite robust.  One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of third quarter revenue.", "Now turning to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $284.1 million which included $11.4 million of amortization of intangible assets and $14 million of share based compensation.  Total non-GAAP costs and expenses declined 4% to $251.9 million and were below our planned range despite absorbing the analog business group acquisition.  The decrease was driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses such as variable compensation as well as companywide cost control. ", "As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the quarter.  Q4 operating margin is expected to decline sequentially due to lower revenues and traditionally higher Q4 expenses driven primarily by variable compensation.  This is consistent with the quarterly expense profile we outlined entering the year and similar to year ago trends.  While quarterly expenses can be lumpy due in part to the timing of large transactions, for the year we continue to expect total expense growth to be slightly less than our targeted revenue growth even with our recent acquisitions.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings were $0.32 per share down from $0.39 a year ago.  As you\u2019ll recall, Q3 \u201908 GAAP earnings included a onetime $17.3 million tax benefit associated with the IRS settlement for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  Non-GAAP earnings were $0.47 per share exceeding our target range, and includes the slight dilution from our recent acquisition.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 26% for the quarter and for the entire year we continue to expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%.  Our revenue visibility remains strong with greater than 90% coming from beginning of quarter backlog.  Up front revenue was 5% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%.  The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.8 years.  ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items, we entered the quarter with $1.08 billion in cash and short term investments.  Of this balance, 55% is held within the United States.  We generated $232 million in cash from operations in the quarter including an expected annual payment from a large customer.  We are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to approximately $190 to $210 million driven primarily by an improved customer collections environment.  ", "This target does not include any impact from our tentative tax settlement from the IRS that we detailed last quarter.   While still subject to further approval by the Federal Government, we would expect the settlement to result in cash payments of approximately $50 million over the next 12 months which would be fully offset by tax benefits in future years.  We also expect that the settlement would finally permit certain tax refund claims of around $35 million from other years to be paid to the company in 2010.", "Now continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $9.9 million in the quarter.  For the full year we expect cap ex to be approximately $35 to $40 million including some additional Q4 expenditures as we consolidate our Bay Area facilities.  While this is a slight upward revision to our original target range, it\u2019s roughly flat with last year.  We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $210 million remaining on our current authorization.  Recall that we acquired the analog business from MIPS Technologies during the quarter in an all cash deal funded from our US cash balance.  As always we\u2019ll evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter including company operations, investments and stock repurchases and at the same time we value the flexibility that our cash provides.", "Q3 net account receivables totaled $136.8 million and DSOs declined 15 days sequentially to 36 days reflecting the high quality of our current account receivable portfolio and the timing of invoices.  Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $618.6 million.  We ended the quarter with approximately 5,990 employees, an expected increase due primarily to the analog business group acquisition.  While we have selectively grown our headcount primarily through acquisition, more than a third of our total employees are located in lower cost geographies.", "Now, moving on to guidance; for the fourth quarter of FY \u201909, our targets are revenue between $335 and $343 million reflecting some caution regarding the level of up front and turns business.  Total GAAP costs and expenses between $297 and $313 million which includes approximately $15 million of share based compensation expense.  Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $272 and $282 million, other income and expense between zero and $3 million, non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%, outstanding shares between 146 and 149 million, GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.21 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.39 to $0.33 per share.  We expect greater than 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog.  ", "As a result our 2009 outlook is: revenues are approximately $1.357 to $1.365 billion representing growth of about 1.5% to 2%; other income and expense between $11 and $14 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between 144 and 146.5 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.16 and $1.23 which includes the impact of approximately $58 million in share based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.75; and we\u2019ve increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.9 and the top end by $0.3.  As I mentioned earlier we are targeting cash flow from operations of $190 to $210 million which does not include any impact from our tentative tax settlement with the IRS.  We will provide 2010 guidance in our next earnings call in December reporting Q4 results.  ", "In summary, we continue to manage the business well in what is a difficult economic environment.  I\u2019m pleased with our consistent execution and solid financial results, highlighted by operating margin expansion and solid cash flow generation.  With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company.  ", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Aart can you talk - don\u2019t talk explicitly about bookings, but how, even qualitatively, how have bookings come in here in Q3?  I think last quarter you suggested that Q1 was weak, Q2 I thought was closer to your expectation.  How\u2019s the bookings environment feel how bookings have been coming in, even qualitatively if you can make any comment?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "We don\u2019t give any quantitative comments but qualitatively I would say it is sort of back to expectations.  The Q1 was extraordinary just because almost every company was in shell shock and just delayed all decisions.  I think we\u2019re now back to business as usual with one difference from the past which I eluded to which is that all the contracts tend to go a little bit longer towards the end of the contract which is actually very reasonable behavior given the situation and given that the contract that we are closing are coming in just fine.  I think this is exactly the type of situation for which we are well equipped.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "So run rate I think last quarter you talked about it being - annualized run rate sort of at par or slightly below, same general trend.", "?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "Yes that has not changed partially because we\u2019re really reflecting what\u2019s happened early into the year.  I remain a little bit cautious about will there be further consolidation or changes in the semiconductor industry but at the same time I also see a number of signs that people are definitely seeing some light at the end of the tunnel or at least preparing for that.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "You mentioned some incremental caution on some of the turns business that you would normally see in Q4.  What\u2019s driving that or is that a minor effect?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "I think it\u2019s a minor effect.  It\u2019s more that, in a situation where people live with uncertainty are cautious, turns business can be easily delayed by a day, a week, or a month and if those happen to be the dates that cross the boundary of a quarter one tends to be a little bit more sensitive to that.  However, the quality of our business model is such that we enter with the quarter with a high degree of confidence in our revenue and so it\u2019s really just on the margin I would think.", "Raj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "One last one if I might, Brian talked about a strong balance sheet, you\u2019ve got a $1 billion in cash.  You\u2019ve talked for some time and I think it\u2019s been clearly the smart decision; preserve optionality and you stop buybacks and you just sat on the cash.  At what point do you start considering buybacks again?  I mean you\u2019ve got clearly excess cash sitting here, what triggers a decision to maybe begin to deploy that cash rather than just sit on it?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "Oh well we actually make that decision every quarter and so this is not just something you put on the shelf for a long period of time.  I think you\u2019ve got correctly the fact that we looked at having optionality in our option space.  We have that.  I think there\u2019s many changes to come in the industries around us and so right now we like the fact that we have a high degree of freedom of what we\u2019re going to do but there\u2019s also no question that buyback could be one of the things that we can use the cash for.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Petkun \u2013 D.A. Davidson.", "Matt Petkun \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "", "A couple questions from me, first just when I look at the sales and marketing line item Brian, you\u2019ve been running consistently at rates at, or in this quarter below last year\u2019s rates on a year-over-year basis.  Is it fair to say that you\u2019ve made some structural changes and we could expect that maybe you\u2019re getting a little bit more leverage out of that group?  Obviously some of it relates to the bookings activity this year versus last year.  But more directly I\u2019m wondering how we should think about that number moving into Q4?", "Brian M. Beattie", "", "Yes Matt, I\u2019d say that the majority of the reasons on the quarter-to-quarter profile as well as the increase projected effectively in the fourth quarter is related primarily to variable compensation.  We indicated again that is one of the factors there relates, and not only it\u2019s tradition in the fourth quarter, not only there, we look at the fourth quarter and this fourth quarter actually will be lower than last year\u2019s fourth quarter and we forecasted along the lines.  So I\u2019d just say that\u2019s the primary area of variation from quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s on variable compensation.  We\u2019re also seeing some really significant improvements on the travel areas.  We\u2019re down about 40% year-over-year as well as below our budget on travel savings and benefits.  So again, just focused at this business to optimize the margin and cash flow.", "Matt Petkun \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "", "Then Aart, looking at this analog IP business it\u2019s obviously early days but I\u2019m wondering if any of the conversations you\u2019ve had, do you see any opportunity to maybe pull through some of your, some digital design opportunities especially in the areas of wireless video?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "Well Matt, this has absolutely been a very good buy for us because, not only does it add a substantial catalog of analog IP blocks, it also adds some very strong IP designers.  Very few people know that we have over 450 analog designers within Synopsys at this point in time.  So right here at a minimum there\u2019s a strong incentive to make sure our analog tools do very well within the company.  ", "Having said that, this was one of the acquisitions where I got an enormous amount of unasked for positive feedback from customers almost right away.  What that tells me is A, they were really looking at the company as having an opportunity to strengthen the products that they were getting and go further with that and B, that there\u2019s a strong desire to see Synopsys take a stronger position in that direction as well.  And yes, it has some impact on the tools going forward, although I think that will take a little bit longer time.", "Matt Petkun \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "", "Then just one other question, Brian you said that some of your guidance for Q4 was related to upfront, your caution on upfront and turns based business, are you saying that you think that bookings could be delayed and so the upfront portion and the turns portion of that business could be affected because when I look at your upfront revenues in general, they\u2019ve been relatively stable the last three quarters in a tougher environment?", "Brian M. Beattie", "", "Yes, I think you\u2019re exactly right.  The impact on the business from quarter-to-quarter, again we\u2019re discussing here pretty slight variations from one to the next built into the guidance and with, as you saw in the third quarter 95% of the quarter coming over from the previous quarter in terms of bookings and visibility, we\u2019re in a real strong position so, we\u2019re just dealing with that extra 5%.   Our commitment is when we provide that guidance, we\u2019re looking at what we\u2019ve already got booked for the quarter as well as anticipation.  ", "So good performance on the time-based licenses continuing each quarter-to-quarter and just a little bit of caution around the deals that we\u2019re going to close where we\u2019ll be able to take revenue on those deals in the quarter.  So as you know if they close at the very end of the fourth quarter, then there\u2019s very little revenue associated with that and we\u2019re just cautious relative to the timing.  As Aart said, as customers are effectively waiting, in some cases, until the end of their contracts to be renewed.  And we say when they renew them not if they renew them but it\u2019s again, has an impact slightly on the revenues and we just need to be cautious as we look at the fourth quarter.", "Matt Petkun \u2013 D.A. Davidson", "", "Okay so just to be clear, when I\u2019m looking at the potential for a sequential decline in revenues that would be the upfront portion recognized in time based licenses is primarily where you\u2019re seeing that, is that correct?", "Brian M. Beattie", "", "No, no.  It\u2019s actually the time based licenses is pretty solid actually.  It\u2019s just the line called upfront revenues itself.  So I\u2019ll break it down for you, upfront and time based licenses and the sequential decline there is in that upfront portion just associated with the type of transactions and you can see it\u2019s a small number anyways.  But that amount of variability that we have some visibility to now in the quarter is where we would anticipate the decline.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "", "Aart, in your prepared remarks you mentioned you expected to exit the fiscal year at a slightly lower, I think you said revenue run rate which is the first time I\u2019d specifically heard you call it out.  I guess from parsing between upfront and time based, I\u2019m just trying to understand where is the lower revenue run rate coming from, is it because of the lower bookings that happened in the first quarter or two or is it something you\u2019re seeing more recently like this concern over upfront that you\u2019re talking about in the fourth quarter?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "", "Let me clarify, first when we look at the revenue, there\u2019re multiple components to that.  What we refer to as the revenue run rate which is not a very, very firm number because it\u2019s difficult to actually calculate it, is essentially a measure of repeatability of all the large contracts.  So the only reason the revenue run rate is slightly down is because early in the year there were a number of companies that frankly just disappeared.  Meaning that there were bankruptcies, there were companies that went out of business and part of that was in our backlog, part of were going to be renewed and they\u2019re gone.", "Having said that, we have seen a complete decline of those, actually I\u2019m not even sure there were any bankruptcies in Q3 now that we\u2019re talking about it.  So this has gradually improved during the year and we wanted to make sure people understand that the semiconductor industry is still in beginning of recovery mode.  It\u2019s not massive recovery partially because what you see is mostly from inventory corrections.  Having said that, overall the future does look a lot better than certainly the last three of four quarters and we are in a very solid position.  So, this was to give you a sense of how we look at the business exiting what we see the de facto as probably two to two and a half year recession and we have many other things that we can do on top of the existing revenue run rates and that we will do to grow the business from there.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "So you\u2019re last couple of sentences there were intriguing but it sounds like sort of all things equal without any acquisitions presumably you would expect 2010 to be a down revenue year from 2009 and I know we don\u2019t want to get in to guidance but it sounds like kind of that\u2019s what would be implied by your run rate statement.", "Aart J. de Geus ", "As you said, we don\u2019t want to get in to guidance right now.  I think we are trying to make sure that we don\u2019t get ahead of making predictions too quickly on both the basis of what happened earlier this year which gives some caution but also on the basis of how things feel right now which feel much more positive and the fact that I think we\u2019re executing particularly well.  You may recall, if you look way back in some of our earnings releases, that probably about four of five quarters ago already I warned that we were going to start paying more attention to expenses in light of potential revenue shifts if there was a recession.", "There\u2019s been obviously a massive recession.  I think we\u2019re sailing through this with flying colors as a matter of fact and the very fact that we will deliver growth in \u201909 according to the guidance we just gave, I think is a solid sign for that.  So, we\u2019re just trying to be very complete in how we let you know about the picture without wanting to give guidance before giving guidance.  Just the fact that we had, I think, outstanding results in Q3 shouldn\u2019t let us dance on the table.  Yes, this is in an environment that\u2019s tough but I think Synopsys is executing particularly well.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "One final one if I could.  You mentioned TSMC rolling out the iPDKs which would seem to be a boom for folks like yourself trying to break in to the analog design space.  Could you give us a sense of what your sense is of how significant those are?  Folks have been trying to use open access and pie cells for a while to sort of break in to established Cadence accounts.  What do you think the iPDKs might mean for that effort", "Aart J. de Geus ", "In general, all fields go through evolutions and that is true for the analog field, it\u2019s true for many other fields.  The open access coalition and effort have been some very, very good efforts for many years that actually were pioneered by Cadence who has added a lot of value to that.  This is not any different than Synopsys many years ago pioneering many of the other access formalisms around digital design because we all know very well that our customers use a number of tools from a variety of sources that have to work together.", "Simultaneously it\u2019s also clear that with the smaller geometries, it is more and more important for the availability of libraries to not only be there for all of the tools but also not become too costly and be complete in terms of the technology terms.  So, the iPDKs are really the next evolution that the entire industry is signing up for and the fact that TSMC is leading the pathway in providing the data is a good sign because they are by far, by far, the largest foundry in the world so we all rely on the quality of the models they provide so iPDKs is a very good thing.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "I want to circle back Aart to the comment that you made in your prepared remarks about the stress on the industry and I wanted to get some clarification.  So, you\u2019re seeing the improvement, inventory replenishment in some sectors, you mentioned that they need to feel confident in the improvement before you start to see some improvement in your own business.  But, I wanted to make sure, did you say that stress would continue in to 2010 or to 2010?  It would seem to me that if they see a decent back half that they should start improving their spend and demand in the beginning of 2010?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "Let me start by saying let\u2019s not over stress the fact that I\u2019m not the oracle on what is going to happen in the semiconductor industry.  I may talk to a lot of people but it\u2019s a hard industry to completely predict.  What I meant to say is actually through 2010 meaning that if you look at the present semiconductor industry, just to give you some rough numbers, the first quarter it shot down 38% and that\u2019s where everybody sort of hit the brakes.  Then, it shot back up by virtue of inventory replenishing and many short term orders. ", "Now, the expectations, and the jury is actually still very much out, the expectations are for the semiconductor industry to end at about -15% to -20% down from let\u2019s say \u201907 to \u201908.  I can certainly confirm that that is the gut feel that I\u2019m getting from all the execs I talk to.  After that, the semiconductor industry will most likely behave like it always did which is ups and downs but a gradual return that some have said will go all the way to 2013.  I think it\u2019s much more likely that it\u2019s through 2011 but in other words, 2010 is a gradual recovery year.", "How do people behave in such a situation?  Well, in such a situation they have clearly seen that there\u2019s been a big disruption in the past year.  They have clearly seen that a number of companies did not do well, others have gained strength but it\u2019s not visible yet, and most likely there will be some consolidation or rearrangement of the industry.  So, during that time, those that have hard needs will absolutely spend more but most others will just sort of try to lay low a little bit in their expenditures.  ", "I think that they will focus a great deal on spending more with those people where they can simultaneously save somewhere else.  Therein lies some of the opportunities for us because we touch more than DDA budgets, we touch actually the total cost of design.  So, what we have tried to do is to increasingly focus on interaction with customers on the basis of their overall economics.  That by the way is a great opportunity that has been accentuated by the recession which is we talk to high levels in companies about their economics instead of the details of cross capacitants coupling somewhere in some tool.", "The picture I tried to project is one that said we at Synopsys have a great opportunity to really strengthen and broaden our position while at the same time setting up a growth pattern for the future that is predicated on knowing that people have to simultaneously be cautious in their expenditures.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "The next question is actually for Brian based on your comment, if we looked at it, your total expenses were $14 million below the midpoint of the guided range for non-GAAP expenses.  How much of that coming in below was that variable component that you mentioned?", "Brian M. Beattie ", "Oh, most of it.  I don\u2019t want to say all of it here because there have been a lot of very good actions taken by the team on minimizing compensation and taking the right actions to keep the spending rate low that we indicated we would do at the beginning of the year.  But, the rest is just timing that\u2019s going to be moving in to the fourth quarter as I was indicating.  Then, you\u2019d anticipate Q1 drops as it has pretty well every year from the Q4 levels just based on the timing of variable compensation related to commissions, any incentive plans and so on in place and very traditional flow.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "Then help me reconcile if most of that came from variables coming in lower, that would suggest to me then that actually your bookings in the third quarter were below what you anticipated when you gave guidance last quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie ", "Well, we indicated a couple of things last quarter and we\u2019re reiterating this quarter that contracts are renewing closer to their expiry date.  Again, as you know, with our business model if the contract hasn\u2019t expired yet it does not have an impact to our revenue profiles.  We\u2019re in a great position to work through the best thing, provide the best value for the customers and the right thing for Synopsys.  If it closes at the end of one quarter, it\u2019s fine; if it closes three days later and flips in to the fourth quarter, that\u2019s fine too.  ", "But, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re watching and certainly it\u2019s been a trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year of closing off the agreements closer to the expiry of them itself.  So, we\u2019ll work it through.  Yes, there was a little bit of a shift in those deals that moved in to the fourth quarter and that\u2019s what we factored in to our plan but again, as we\u2019re tacking it through great financial results for the year.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan", "The last question is on cash flow, based on the cash flow guidance that you gave for the full year, it would indicate the lowest fourth quarter cash flow that you\u2019ve generated since 2002 so if you had maybe some of the bookings slip in to the fourth quarter did you see actual collections get pulled forward and collected earlier than you would have thought?", "Brian M. Beattie ", "I\u2019d say most of it was really from a returning level of confidence with our customers.  As we got through the first quarter that was the highest level of uncertainty and the highest level of announced bankruptcies, slow payments and so on.  Then, we saw the second quarter again coming back to a stability level and with more confidence returning in the third quarter there appears to be a sense of recovery that the customers were very good on paying exactly on their due dates and we\u2019ve got very deep relationships with them so the cash inflow came in strong during the quarter and as a result we were able to increase our operating cash flow levels as we indicated just based on better performance, more certainty around collection and more confidence as we go in to the fourth quarter that the collections and the spending profiles will be profitably managed, both sides of it, to generate increased operating cash flow for the company in 2009.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from KC Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "KC Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "To pick up on the question of cash flow, can we conclude that the strength in cash collection is a sign that the customers are actually loosening up their purse strings?  Was the improved collection coming from just a few customers or was it more broad based?", "Brian M. Beattie ", "Well, an increase in confidence and cash flow on expected dates from the scheduled customers that we had scheduled through the agreements.  As you know, we take all of our backlog and profile that in terms of revenues going forward and cash to be collected forward by customer, by quarter.  The customers paid as expected, again just based on the relationships that we\u2019ve been able to build up and there was far less activity related to slow payments and announcements of bankruptcies.  Still a couple of small ones but overall the performance was again stabilizing this quarter and a slight level of improvement going forward.  So, they just paid per the terms and the agreements, nothing in advance and very little in arrears of their expected dates.", "KC Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Sort of a broad question, I\u2019m trying to understand [inaudible], would you at least say that your top line will be in the same direction as your customers?  Meaning that if your customers are going to see an up kind of turn that will be the same direction that you would expect your top line?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "I think you\u2019re asking us for guidance for \u201910 that we don\u2019t want to give yet.  I think generically the answer is yes because we do follow the semiconductor industry. The reason one should not answer your question with yes is because the semiconductor industry moves with incredible ups and downs.  In aggregate the stability of semiconductor is actually quite good but in quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year it can easily bump from 20% to -20%.  Whereas we would love to take the 20%, I don\u2019t think we want to take the -20%, which we just saw by the way.", "So, just to maybe categorize some of many of the questions I just heard in the last few minutes both in terms of cash, in terms of orders, in terms of business profile, I do think that our customers are in aggregate more confident that things are solidifying and therefore are moving back a bit more to business as usual.  It\u2019s just that the business as usual right now is not at the same level as it was \u201907 and \u201908 yet and that will take some time.  ", "If you take those comments in conjunction you would have to say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s actually a great opportunity for Synopsys.\u201d  Because, with the massive downturn we have been able to hold the fort so to speak meaning that we\u2019ve done very well and with the expected upturn or return, we have an opportunity to build on the strength that we have carefully cemented over the last year and a half as this was happening.  So, we see actually great business opportunities, it\u2019s just that like nobody was really capable of completely calling the downturn in Q4/Q1, one cannot really completely call the upturn exactly either.", "KC Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You talked about taking advantage of the downturn and looking to have positive shift towards you guys, is it fair to assume that for the coming couple of years at least that your top line would outgrow that of your peers?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "The part of the challenge with that statement is that many people have gone through model changes.  However, what I can say is that I think we have a model that is incredibly solid but more importantly than that is that model is now built on a product portfolio and a customer penetration that is very, very solid.  So, that allows us to build on top of that basis going forward and the fact that we now lead the industry and have an opportunity to really help customers that are trying to save money while at the same time spending well with us, I think is a great opportunity for us to fuel the growth going forward.", "KC Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Lastly, on the op ex, have most of the temporary savings, have most of them been unwanted?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "I\u2019m not sure which temporary savings you\u2019re talking about.  What we have done is systematically gone through the company and prioritized all the savings that we could do.  Some were obvious things that one should do, some are things that one can do if there was a worse recession or what have you.  Luckily for us, we\u2019ve been able to do very well with a number of things that have reduced our day-to-day spending.  I think Brian mentioned already the travel line which is a very visible example but it\u2019s also making sure that we invest in those areas that will have a return going forward.  ", "We expect to continue that behavior so far for me to say that there\u2019s not more places that we can save but it\u2019s also clear that there are opportunities for us to invest be it in R&D, be it in M&A, be it in special support situations of customers that we can help through the downturn.  All of those are essentially building solidity for the future.  We\u2019re doing all of those.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Paul Wick \u2013 J&W Seligman & Co.", "Paul Wick \u2013 J&W Seligman & Co.", "Could you just talk about the uptick in maintenance and services on the income statement and what was the cause of that and whether it\u2019s sustainable?", "Brian M. Beattie ", "The slight uptick in terms of the service revenue that\u2019s up year-over-year and up sequentially is driven by a couple of large consulting contracts that we had in the quarter and to a much lesser extent the new acquisition we had with Chipidea.  We had a number of the contracts, they\u2019re in the IP area specifically where we have multiple deliveries, the company\u2019s been working on them for some time and completed those in the third quarter allowing us to take revenue on all the deliverables.  So, it is a little bit of a catch up, it does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on the milestone completions so that\u2019s part of the elements that have contributed to it in the third quarter specifically.  It\u2019s not exactly consistent quarter-to-quarter, it just depends on those big consulting deals that we do.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "I just wanted to follow up on the run rate question, my understanding now as you\u2019ve said it is that it sounds like the lower run rate is due largely due to some customer bankruptcies early in the first half of your year but that things are more stable now.  I just wanted to clarify that in fact the run rates you\u2019re seeing now on renewals are close to flattish or whatever you were referring to X the bankruptcies in the first half.  Is that correct?", "Aart J. de Geus ", "We don\u2019t quantify the run rate number for a variety of reasons but I think your statement in general terms is actually very correct.", "Operator", "", "We have no further questions at this time.   Presenters I\u2019ll turn the call back to you.", "Aart J. de Geus ", "Thank you again for attending this quarter.  I think that in an environment that is to say the least very interesting, we feel that we\u2019re actually fairing very, very well and have been able to take advantage of some of our strength and will continue to play those out going forward.  As usual, Brian and I will be available for follow up questions the next few hours.  Thank you and have a good day.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen we thank you for your participation as well as using AT&T\u2019s Executive Teleconference service.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions).", "Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Doug. Good afternoon everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call Synopsys will make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2009, and in our earnings release for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report of Form 8-K that we filed today, our fourth quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, I\u2019m happy to report that we executed well in Q4 and in fiscal 2009 we delivered revenue growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow, significant customer momentum and numerous new technology roll outs.", "Given the extraordinary nature of the year for the overall economy, let me comment on our financials mostly from a fiscal 2009 perspective. The bottom-line is simple, we met or exceeded almost every goal we set at the beginning of the year and most importantly we entered 2010 with a great deal of strength.", "Specifically, with $0.33 in the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 for the year, that\u2019s 5% or $0.09 above the midpoint target we communicated at the beginning of \u201809. With Q4 revenue of $338 million, we grew our business 2% to $1.36 billion for the year.", "Through disciplined expense control and focus on efficiency we improved non-GAAP ops margin over last year from 23% to 24%. These results were achieved under our predictable business model with more than 90% time based revenue. We aggregated the year with $2.2 billion in backlog and $1.17 billion in cash.", "In summary, over the past 18 months, Synopsys has undergone a remarkable transformation with 2009 representing a turning point for our business. Our many years of technology development are now clearly making a difference with customers.", "Turning to our customers, the recession set up their alignment with fewer key suppliers. What began as a technological necessity, the integration of flows and platforms for better and faster design, accelerated for intense cost reasons. As customers were driven to rethink their expense structures and make meaningful changes. These changes are still ongoing, so let me briefly address the economic environment.", "Semiconductor markets are rebounding from a very tough first half with semi revenue now expected to be down 10% to 15% from last year, a welcome improvement of our previous expectations. Looking forward, there is still a good amount of uncertainty regarding holiday sales and stable business levels for next year. While the rush orders are driving up volume and prices, the lack of visibility causes continued frugality and streamlining of operations.", "As some of you know in an ad hoc fashion I have been calling executives around the world about their outlook on the recovery. Their perception of the economy is remarkably uniform. They all express some optimism regarding a gradual return to growth, but they also think there is almost a 50-50 chance of a more challenging outlook or even potential W pattern that is another downturn before a sustained recovery.", "What this tells me is that although our customers are orienting their companies towards returning growth, they will remain quite careful in terms of expenses. Looking forward into fiscal 2010, we are therefore setting conservative expectations as we account for the uncertainty around us.", "From a planning perspective we entered the year with an overall business run rate that is roughly flat, a testament to our strength in the phase of considerable customer stress in the first of the year. Our backlog is strong. We have over 80% of targeted 2010 revenue and more than 90% of Q1 already in hand.", "Without factoring in any future acquisitions or stock buybacks, we expect non-GAAP ops margin to remain steady on slightly lower revenue, and non-GAAP earnings to be slightly down in parts due tough year-to-year comparisons of tax rate and OI&E. ", "We also expect cash flow to be strong or to increase and several new technology rollouts to extend our innovation leads. Brian will give you more specifics on both the past and coming year, but looking back Synopsys executed extremely well in \u201809 and is poised for 2010 with momentum and strength.", "From a technology perspective, we drive three objectives. First, deliver best in class technology across all our products to enable customers to create differentiation in their chips. Second, deliver solutions integrated across tools, IT, design flows and methodology, to enable our customers to achieve high productivity and predictability. Third, provide top notch global engineering services and support to help our customers reduce their overall design cost and risk.", "To that end, in \u201809 we invested assertively in R&D and in our technical support resulting in a strong product roadmap and broadened customer relationships. Key semiconductor companies such as Juniper, Sunplus, Intel, Marvel, Panasonic, Renesas and more than a dozen others are counting on us as their primary EDA partner.", "During \u201809, a number of companies successfully migrated to Synopsys and are achieving the increase in effectiveness that they had hoped for. Let me provide some technical highlights from the year starting with our Galaxy implementation platform.", "IC Complier, our product is the cornerstone to designing the most advanced chips in the world. This year, in addition to an advanced router that delivers 10x performance and better quality of results, IC Complier has been significantly enhanced with multicore and low power features. Multicore capabilities were also expanded to our entire sign off solution thus completing the migration of Galaxy to the most modern compute infrastructure.", "With IC Validator we then introduced a new physical verification solution that took both technology and integration a significant step forward. What\u2019s unique about IC Validator is that physical verification can now be accomplished within the implementation flow long before sign off thus considerably reducing turn around time and the number of iterations. This is a meaningful productivity advance and customers such as Toshiba, Nvidia and the common platform alliance are already recognizing the power of IC Validator in their advanced applications.", "We also made excellent progress in bringing together tools and flows with the introduction of our links design system, the result of many years of internal development and testing Links is a differentiator for Synopsys. Developed for 65 nanometer and below, Link features a complete, open, production proven digital design flow with built-in methodology, foundry ready checks and an advanced management cost base. Links has direct impact on total cost of design and gives customers instantaneous entry into a proven low power design flow.", "Another major accomplishment in \u201809 was the introduction of custom designer for analog mixed signal design. Not only did we deliver a very strong first product in an area previously dominated by another vendor, but customers have already completed a number of production tape outs including the latest by Digital Imaging Systems. An expert in analog system design for the mobile market, Digital Imaging completely replaced its old flaw and was able to tape out this custom designer in less than a month.", "While newer companies with little legacy infrastructure were the natural initial targets, we are now seeing incremental acceptance at a number of larger customers. At One we have seen substantial lead in terms of acceptance. As a result of One Group\u2019s success this company\u2019s CAD group is now willing to provide Custom Designer across their company. Another very large customer has made Custom Designer plan of record for its latest advanced chip.", "Turning to verification, our Discovery platform continues to perform very well in both digital and analog mix signals. In digital in \u201809 we extended our multicore capability to VCS resulting in a 2X improvement in speed. Given the increasing cost of verification speed improvements of this magnitude significantly impact overall design time and reduce the compute infrastructure cost as well. In fact our tracking clearly shows that the majority of the advanced designs in the world use VCS as their main simulator.", "In analog verification, our key introduction in \u201809 was CustomSim, a single multicore solution for analog mix signal simulation. By complaining the speed and accuracy of what used to be three separate tools we developed a flexible easy to deploy solution that has strengthened our offering.", "Moving up into systems, we delivered several key enhancements to our former rapid prototyping platform including the acquired technology from CHIPit. Most chips today are in fact complex hardware-software systems, thus the breadth of our solution ranging from high level system simulation to virtual platforms to FPGA based prototyping, all the way to broad functional and analog mixed signal simulation put Synopsys at the forefront in dealing with one of the most pressing issues system level design.", "Closing off with our IP business. We made excellent progress in \u201809 here as well. IP is a powerful component of our portfolio especially as an intense focus on reducing cost, drives companies to accelerate the outsourcing of non-differentiating projects.", "For example, we estimate that every other day a chip is taped out using a Synopsys USB core. In addition, we have substantially grown our collection of cores into many new technology notes expanding protocols beyond USB such as PCI Express, SATA and HDMI. In \u201809, our portfolio was further broadened into the analog mixed signal space through the acquisition of the analog business group for mixed.", "The integration has gone very well and the customer reaction has been especially positive. All of this adds up to a very strong year in a difficult economy. A number of customers are putting their trust in Synopsys for their future and are in the process of migrating to our solution. Financially, the impact will occur gradually but we can feel that Synopsys has excellent momentum entering fiscal 2010.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comment today I\u2019ll summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year 2009 and provide you with our 2010 guidance.", "As a reminder, I will be discussing some GAAP and non-GAAP measures for our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year over-year-year unless I specify it otherwise.", "Now, as Aart mentioned, we executed well against our targets in wrapping up an outstanding year. In a challenging environment we achieved growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, generated considerable operating cash flow and expanded our non-GAAP operating margins, which position Synopsys very well for 2010 and beyond. Let me now provide some additional details on our financials.", "Q4 revenue was $338.3 million, a decline of 4% compared to a year ago, but well within our target range. Annual revenue was $1.36 billion, a 2% increase over our revenue for all of 2008. The IP system space did very well for the year while consulting services declined as customers focused on reducing cost by delaying some engagements especially in the first half of the year. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue.", "Turning to expenses, Q4 GAAP costs and expenses where $313.4 million which included $11.6 million of amortization of intangible assets, $14.1 million of stock-based compensation, $4.5 million of facility restructuring charges and $1.2 million of in process R&D. For the year, GAAP costs and expenses were $1.152 billion, which included $45.5 million of amortization of intangible assets, $56.9 million of stock based compensation, $4.5 million of facility restructuring charges and $2.2 million of IP R&D.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $279 million in Q4 and $1.034 billion for fiscal 2009, up very slightly from $1.026 billion in 2008, but below our original 2009 expense budget even with our recent acquisitions.", "As expected, Q4 and non-GAAP operating margins declined sequentially to 17.5% due primarily to traditionally higher Q4 expenses. For the entire year we exceeded our non-GAAP operating margin commitment by achieving 24% an increase of approximately 100 basis points over 2008.", "Now entering 2009, our management team was fully prepared to react quickly on expenses should the environment materially change. As a result, when the EDA and semiconductor industry was becoming increasingly turbulent we proactively aligned expenses with moderating revenue growth. ", "By diligently managing vendor and contractor costs, compensation and headcount related expenses and discretionary spending; total expense growth was less than the revenue growth for the entire year. With a continued focus on operational efficiency, we currently expect to maintain our 2009 non-GAAP operating margin as well as operating income for all of 2010 even with slightly lower revenues.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 for the quarter and a $1.15 for the year, down from $0.32 for Q4 of last year and a $1.29 for all of 2008. As you recall, FY08 earnings included a one time $17.3 million tax benefit or $0.12 per share associated with the IRS settlement for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.33 for the quarter and a $1.75 for the year. As Aart mentioned, our yearly achievement is considerably above the mid point of our original targets primarily as a result of our lower than expected tax rate and higher than expected OI&E. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.8% in Q4 reflecting a more favorable geographic mix and 25.4% for the full year. For modeling purposes we think that a 27% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for 2010.", "Our revenue visibility remains strong with 95% of Q4 revenues coming from beginning of quarter backlog. Upfront revenue was approximately 5% of total for Q4 and all of FY09, well within our target range of less than 10% even with the inclusion of hardware sales. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter and fiscal year was about three years as customers continue to have a high degree of confidence in the strength of our technologies position over the long term.", "As expected, backlog declined due primarily to the timing of the large contract renewals. Recalling that 2008 ending backlog included a notable positive impact from currency benefits it did not recur in 2009. While not material, we also saw several customer bankruptcies during the year resulting in the removal of less than $50 million in backlog. With bookings of about a $1 billion in 2009, our total backlog at the end of the year was $2.2 billion as customers continue to wait until closer to the contract exploration to renew.", "Our model affords us the ability to be flexible in the timing of contract renewals, so they make sense for both parties. Our solid run rate at the end of the year is a testament to the effectiveness of that flexibility. And finally as Aart mentioned we have greater than 80% of our target revenue in hand for the coming year and more than 90% for the coming quarter.", "So turning to our cash and balance sheet items, we ended the year with $1.17 billion in cash and short term investments. Of this balance, 52% is held within United States. We generated $61.5 million in cash from operations in the quarter which included a one time $19 million tax prepayment to the IRS as part of our tentative settlement for years 2002 and 2004 resulting in $236.7 million in operating cash flow for the full year.", "While we are still awaiting final approval of our IRS settlement, I would like to reiterate that if the tentative settlement becomes final, there will be no material non-GAAP P&L impact. It is expected to result in a decrease in GAAP income tax expense as a result of the new FAS 141 accounting rules which take effect in 2010.", "2009 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations due primarily to expense management and improved customer collections environment in the second half of the year and lower tax disbursements due to some one time benefits.", "At this time, we are targeting operating cash flow of approximately $200 to $220 million in FY10. We also expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of 2010 due primarily to timing of our annual incentive compensation payments.", "So, continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items, our capital expenditures were $12.1 million for the quarter and $36.7 million for the year, down from $38.9 million last year. For 2010 we expect capital spending to increase to approximately $45 to $50 million due primarily to some additional expenditures as we consolidate our bay area facilities to reduce some long term expenses. We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and had approximately $500 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Our intend is to continually evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter, including company operations, investments and stock repurchases. We believe again here we were disciplined in our deployment of cash in 2009 while retaining maximum flexibility in a tough economy.", "We are well positioned in 2010 to increase our strategic uses of cash as the economy begins to improve. Q4 net accounts receivable totaled a $127 million and our industry-leading DSO declined 2 days sequentially to 34 days reflecting the high-quality of our AR portfolio and the timing of invoices. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $588.7 million.", "We ended the quarter with approximately 5930 employees, this was an expected year-over-year increase due primarily to the acquisition of the Analog Business Group from MIPS Technologies, but down slightly from our Q3 headcount.", "Now, let me address our first quarter and the fiscal 2010 and guidance, which as Aart mentioned, is a base case that does not assume any future acquisitions or stock buybacks. For the first quarter of FY10 our targets are revenues between $325 and $333 million. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $206 million and $286 million which includes approximately $15 million of stock-based compensation expense, but does not include any impact of the IRS tentative settlement.", "Total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $245 and $255 million, down from $279 million in Q4. Non-GAAP other income and expenses between zero and 3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between $148 and $153 million, GAAP earnings of $0.23 to $0.28 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2010 outlook. Based on what we know now we expect revenues between $1.33 and $1.35 billion. Non-GAAP other income and expense between $4 and $8 million. our non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between $150 and a $155 million, GAAP earnings per share between $1.01 and a $1.20 which includes the impact of approximately $60 million in stock based compensation expense, but do not include any impact of the IRS tentative settlement.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share of a $1.52 to $1.62, slightly down from 2009 earnings driven primarily by a higher tax rate, lower OI need and higher share count. And again, cash flow from operations were approximately $200 to $220 million.", "Finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide you some brief 2010 expense commentary. At this time we are expecting a fairly linier non-GAAP quarterly expense profile throughout the year with Q4 showing a slightly sharper sequential increase which is very typical for our business.", "So, in summary, Synopsys had a very successfully year despite the many challenges in the global marketplace. We entered 2010 in a stronger competitive position from a financial, technology and customer standpoint by being fiscally conservative and investing responsibly. As a result, we were able to deliver strong profitability while expanding our technology leadership.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Raj Seth - Cowen & Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Brian, in Aart\u2019s prepared remarks suggested that your outlook, your guidance was a bit conservative given the environment. I am curious if you can talk a little bit about what assumptions you have made on run rate renewals which I guess this year was slightly less than par, in your guidance what sort of assumption are you making? Because Aart also talked about orders increasing, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what exactly that means.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, you are right. As we looked at our 2009 rates, and we were signaling during the year as you recall that we thought slightly down run rate coming in terms of our revenue profile as we went through the year.", "So then, as we look then at the 2010 profile itself, we did modify the revenue outlook very slightly just taking into account the profile of the transactions we had, the fact that we anticipated our services business to come down in one of those areas that in 2009 with our customers preferring to reduce rather than investing in third parties outside the services. So, effectively, we have seen a flat run rate in 2009 and then build our plan on top of that for 2010.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "So, just so I am clear, your 2010 plan assumes flattish run rates or does it assume growth in those renewals, I wasn\u2019t quite clear.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, as you know we have already got 80% of the revenue from F4 2010, so a very significant amount that is already factored into guidance that we built in. And apart from that we will have to see how it goes for the new deals as we approach a contract. We do anticipate we noted that we do expect orders to increase this year, and we factor that into our revenue guidance.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Brain, one more and then one for Aart. You mentioned backlog which came down $400 million, obviously some of that is large contracts like Intel that roll off before they get renewed. You mentioned a currency impact last year, some bankruptcies etc accounting for maybe $50 million, less than $50 million, how much was that currency impact that you talked about, how big an impact was that?", "Brian Beattie", "Well it\u2019s fairly significant, it was about $80 million. At the end of \u201808 that was factored in our backlog, as you know our one currency is not US Dollar based, for revenue is the Yen, and that\u2019s a pretty significant ramp up during 2008 of course.", "So, you are right, as we look at the backlog for this year, we did indicate right upfront that we anticipated a moderately lower book-to-bill ratio and then of course we did have a number of deals that we thought bankruptcy is occurring, we took all of that out of our backlog. ", "Then I think the last point as well is that there were a couple of deals that we had scheduled up for the end of \u201809 that moved into 2010 and in fact on of those has already been signed for the year, and that\u2019s pretty typical where you see deals and that\u2019s the beauty of our business model where deals will come up for renewal and we have already had on of those significant deals that wasn\u2019t closed by the end of \u201809 but closed already this quarter.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Okay, thanks. Hey Aart, can you talk a little bit about growth here? I mean the big question people always asking is does EDA really grow. If you assume that the semiconductor industry and I think this is consistent with our last conversation grows, I don\u2019t know, 6%, whatever your number is, does EDA grow more or less than that and why. What\u2019s your view on what growth? It\u2019s hard year to year to tell, but given model shifts etc. but perhaps you could talk a little bit about that.", "Aart de Geus", "I think it\u2019s a good point that it\u2019s hard to tell, largely because semiconductors fluctuate greatly up and down, and certainly these part of EDA industry have a high degree of stability by virtue of having multi year models. ", "So, if you look at our numbers for example between \u201808, \u201809 and \u201810, you essentially see that during this massive fluctuation we are essentially flat. That\u2019s the way to look at those two and half years. And after that I think we will be right in tune with sort of the average of the semiconductor industry.", "If you look at the semiconductor projections, obviously the year is not quite finished, but people would say probably minus 10 to minus 15 down this year probably up from next year, and so an aggregate over that same period of time, the semiconductor industry will be down. And so, relatively speaking, we are actually doing well compared to the industry that feeds us.", "Now, having said that, I think the thing that is not visible in all of these numbers is that during this very difficult time around us we have been able to maintain extremely high degree of stability of our financial model and continue to invest and invest and invest in many technologies and position, and because of that we are entering 2010 in a landscape that I think in my opinion is still very questionable around us with an ability to take quite a number of actions. ", "So in that sense, I think we will come out of the overall recession a very strong company, and I think that is actually the interesting story under the story here.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "Last quick one, would you consider a dividend given the stability of the business cash flow generation etc?", "Aart de Geus", "Not at this point in time, and off the school never say never, but I think we have a large number of opportunities in the coming year, and there is a good reason why we have been sitting on our cash all of \u201809, we are happy that we did that. We think that the landscape is changing in 2010 and we want to look at now substantial opportunities to invest in growth. And so, I think a dividend does not accomplish that, there are other ways of cause to return cash to the shareholders, but one of them is clearly to drive for substantial additional growth.", "Raj Seth - Cowen & Company", "I know you can\u2019t be very detailed on across my last one, but you\u2019re implying, you are obviously looking at M&A increasingly this year. Are there any particular adjacencies that are interesting, is there any think you can give us around the kinds of areas where you might look?", "Aart de Geus", "Your opening sentence was correct; we can\u2019t give you much detail here. I think what one should think about it is that as a company we\u2019ve been able to position ourselves very strongly in what we do, and I think that the opportunity for us is to start looking at things that are on the adjacency as you said, meaning in areas to grow our [TAM] not just a stronger penetration of the [SAM], and so I think there are many opportunities because we are a company that have connections to many customers that need a lot of technology. ", "So, I won\u2019t go into too much detail now, but I want to look at 2010 as certainly a year where we should reap some of the benefits of the capital management we\u2019ve had in the past years, and just to make sure I am complete, there are a number of people that have also asked about buybacks that is also a possibility and we are very careful in looking at what are the financial ramifications on any one of these approaches, and there is a reason why we were very cautious in \u201809 and you only have to open the Wall Street Journal to see what the reasons were.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Company.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "A couple of questions; first Aart, just kind of to continue down the same path, I think we all understand how you viewed your technology position and product portfolio to improve your market position with your customers through this downturn. But do you believe that you have used your balance sheet at all to improve your position with your customers over this last 12 months period, because that was one of the things I think we were really focused on relative to your peers, as a competitive advantage and I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s helped.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, so, I think fundamentally we have not used our balance sheet. On the contrary we have build up our balance sheet. There are a couple of small exceptions, maybe the one exception that stands out as having been very valuable is the acquisition of the analog mixed signal business from MIPS that has really been a very, very good move, but in general we have very purposefully build our balance sheet precisely because in the midst of a storm you are very careful, and at some point in time the opportunities will show up.", "Secondly, I would want to highlight that we have spent substantially in R&D, so that\u2019s in the P&L, and we have been able to maintain 30% or so expenditure there, and one of the reasons that we feel very confident and the technology roadmap and technology being prepared for 2010 is because of those investments. And so, you put all of those things together and you say, well, what we have really done is strengthened and solidified our position, our traditional position I would almost say, and prepare the company for taking advantage in a landscape that has changed a lot.", "Now, last but not least, a number of customers have sold us in the very fact that we are financially solid as they have decided to team up with us for the long term. And so, I think all of these puzzle pieces have the potential to really come together in 2010 assuming that there is no major additional economic disruption.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay great. And then, if you take a look back over the last 12 months, what do you think has happened to the total available engineering seat count that you sell into?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, fundamentally I think the seat count has not changed because a number of engineers has not really changed all that much. However, the word seat count is a little bit misleading, because there are a number of seats that are perfectly capable of triggering a lot of tools. ", "So, if you take made the extreme example of Verification, where engineers literally spawn off dozens of projects or have run simultaneously, the utilization of software overall is massively up. And so, from that perspective there is no doubt in my mind, whatsoever that our technology is smack-dab in the middle of what is needed in semiconductor land, it\u2019s also clear that our customers are facing quite a bit of pain and so during \u201809 is not the time to go ask them for lot more money, but those things will rectify themselves in the not too distant future.", "Matt Petkun - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then just one final question for Brian. Brian, so you can avoid having to put out an 8-K maybe tomorrow morning, you guys commented that orders would be up next year, do you expect orders to grow more than 10%.", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, we just want to indicate that the growth in orders is going to go up from 2009 levels, you saw our performance during the year. I think we indicated leading into \u201809 that we came in at about a $1 billion of orders, and anticipate that to grow, but that\u2019s really all we can say. So it\u2019s going to go up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Valera - Needham & Company.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "I guess following up on that, last year your were good enough to talk about the book-to-bill you expected specifically that you expected I guess less than one for the year and that proved out. Can you talk about what you expect the book-to-bill to be less than one, one or greater than one this year?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I don\u2019t think we want to comment on that, and probably shouldn\u2019t have commented last year. But in all certainty last year, the year was radically different than anything could have expected from the outside. ", "Let me give you maybe some other insight, which is, clearly if there is one thing that has changed in 2009 on bookings, is the approximate time line when things get close, but has not changed to us, it may have changed for others, not changed for us is the length of the deal. It tends to be three years and that our run rate was flat.", "What has changed is that the time to closure tends to be much closer to the ends of the contract, and that makes complete sense, because in a massive disruption the first thing people do they do nothing and that\u2019s what we saw in the first couple of quarters of the year, and then they remained cautious unless they see that the future is more assured. That is not a bad thing for us, that is precisely why we have a good backlog and why that is useful.", "Now, in 2010, the situation may change and therefore actually to know exactly what the book-to-bill is hard to predict. The reason we can still say that we expect orders to be higher than this year is because we obviously have quite a number of targets for our sales team on the basis of things that are in the reasonable timeframe of what should be renewed. But aside of that I think we are managing in an environment that is much more turbulent and precisely because we have both the mechanism and the controls we can be very comfortable in managing efficient environment. ", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Okay. And I guess just to follow up a little bit, but it sounds like if your orders are just up a little bit relative to last year, and I forget, Brian, did you say it\u2019s roughly a billion or a $1.1 billion, I\u2019m not sure, but that would imply a significantly less than one to one book-to-bill, sort of eat more backlog and I\u2019m just wondering at what point that would tend to imply I would think a lower revenue run rate than exiting the year in 2010 than you started the year with. ", "So just trying to get my hands around, how we should think about, because most people at this point really want to think about you guys in terms of 2011 really, I know it\u2019s a long away, but this year is sort of a down year based on a tough 2009, I think we understand that. But I think people want to try to get their hands around whether in 2011 there is a reasonable chance of seeing some growth, not perhaps a lot but not another down year.", "Aart de Geus", "Rich let me take that. First to, just on terminology, Brian said quite a bit up in terms of orders, but that\u2019s actually not the relevant thing, it was another part of your question which was the run rate, we do not see the run rates go substantially down, the only question mark on that really would be if there was another way of companies going either bankrupt, which we don\u2019t expect or a number of companies recombining or being acquired, disappearing. ", "So all in all, we actually think that 2010 will be a strong year for us and we have been able to replace revenue from those companies that have disappeared quite well in 2009. I\u2019m actually amazed at the fact that even after a number of substantial bankruptcies we were able to manage a flat run rate.", "So, I don\u2019t think that that is going to get much worse in \u201810, again I don\u2019t want to keep repeating this caveat, well, what if there is a major downturn in \u201810, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s super likely but it\u2019s not impossible.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "Sure. And then Brian, just wondering if you could just talk about the longer term cash flow from ops trends. You have talked in the past about how that should trend, I think sort of towards your operating income or sort of higher than the current level, is there anything you could talk about to give us a sense of where we should see cash flow from ops trending over time in a more normalized environment?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes absolutely. We are really proud of the achievements this year, of course driving $237 million of operating cash flow in the year and the model is mature enough that we see ourselves continuing to generate in that kind of level. Specifically for 2010 we put in $200 million to $220 million and it really kind of lines up with the operating income, but takes into account that we do have an increase in our tax rate effecting for next year.", "We\u2019ve done all we can on the net income if you go back to the operating level we have kept that operating income flat year-over-year even with a slight reduction in the revenue so we\u2019ve got expenses coming done year-over-year. And then you look at other elements sort of below the operating line, such as OI&E which is coming down here just based on some of the FX gains we got in \u201809 based on reduced interest rates of course in the market.", "So, from an operating perspective, we are in good shape that\u2019s flowing through in the cash flow. There is a couple of the one-time below the line items which aren\u2019t as good at this point as we outlook to 2010, and all of that flows through very close for us in terms of the operating cash flow which we would anticipate again being over $200 million in 2010 as we approach it. Moving beyond that it does track very closely to an EBITDA metrics less our taxes, our cash taxes that we pay, and that will tend to track along with EBITDA over the next few years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ryan Goodman - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ", "Ryan Goodman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I had a question on the FY10 guidance, just speaking on that a bit, I think you mentioned that about 80% of that is going to be coming from the backlog, which makes sense that represents about half of backlog right now. Maybe you could just add some color on that remaining 20% piece. It seems a bit high if you assume that comes entirely from bookings in the year just given the 1910 model, what other pieces are there that I need to be thinking about there?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the first comment is we have been able to work now for a number of years with precisely this model, which is coming in with 80% in hand for the year and 90% for the quarter. Actually the number fluctuates a little bit above that typically. But that\u2019s what we have been able to comment on every year.", "And so, from that perspective that is a normal model for Synopsys. Secondly, during the year obviously there are a number of deals that get renewed, and so, for those that then go into effect that is additional revenue, that is not in the backlog at the present time. And then on top of that there tend to be sort of a one off or spot deals, things that could be delivered such as services or IP that tend to be renewed fairly quickly after getting the orders. ", "So, this is actually not only our normal model, but I think especially in the present time incredibly healthy model because most companies do not see this. Notice also that a certain amount of the consulting is not in the backlog until it goes into action.", "Brian Beattie", "Let me add a little bit. In terms of the numbers here, you can see that we have got over a billion dollars of revenue already built in for orders that we\u2019ve achieved leading up to this. So we enter in with over a billion, and the rest to be closed, what we call the turns, are very normal compared to our prior years. So we feel pretty good about the achievability of this guidance.", "Ryan Goodman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then one question on the expenses. In this type of environment you tend to see the expenses scale up a bit with the bookings. But actually the outlook that you gave on the expense side seems pretty good. Could you add some color what\u2019s going on there, why? How much scalability do you have with current expense structure, if 2010 actually does turn out to be a stronger recovery than expected? Are we going to feel that in the expense side and maybe see that more in fiscal \u201811 revenue?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure that\u2019s a good question. If you look at our history we have been steadily managing the ops margin up, and this is I think a great achievement especially that we have continued that even during extremely difficult year 2009. And so, at the present time we are sort of steadily moving towards the mid 20s and we feel okay with that.", "Now, the economic uncertainty, as you said, is quite large, and so, with the present planning horizon it makes no sense to speculate beyond that and we want to be careful in setting expectations. But what is clear is that obviously if things look up then there are many ways in which we can either spend money or keep it. And so, I don\u2019t want to close any doors, I just want to make sure that everybody understands that we are still steadily moving towards the mid 20s at this point in time.", "Ryan Goodman - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then one last question just more qualitatively, talking with your peers out there it seems like there is some sort of some hot bids for competition within the overall EDA sector would come to mind, you have a competitor trying to move in a bit more to your implementation. Now, from your perspective where are you feeling the most pressure if anywhere just across the board?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, interestingly enough, the most pressure comes actually from the customer environment which is a situation where every customer is right now substantially down versus last year, not sure about what\u2019s going to happen next year, and therefore aiming at reducing cost every which way they can.", "Now, the good news for us is we have been actually able to help customers do that by virtue of providing a very complete solution that can be leveraged more for them and in the process grow our business a little bit. But I think the landscape right now, although people are absolutely planning and trying to drive towards some growth, they remain very cautious in their expenditures. And that is really the backdrop I think for our entire guidance forward, is to just reflect the fact that we don\u2019t know what 2010 is going to look like.", "Now, having said that, I want to reemphasize again that in many ways we have had the good fortune of preparing for many years both technically for this complete solution and economically for having a watch that allows us to move when the time is right, and so, we see a number of areas where we actually have seen good growth such as the IP area, we actually did well in the manufacturing area, we see some very interesting things in the system area. So, there is opportunity space for us and I think the time is upon us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "I want to drill into the cash flow guidance for 2010. I always understood that your collection policies were aimed at collecting or front loading the collections within the contract, and you are trying to collect as much of the contract value in the first half of the contract life, and if that\u2019s still the case, how come cash flow wouldn\u2019t at least be flat year-over-year despite the higher tax rate?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, as we said, we are fairly close to the number we achieved this year on the plan. The actual cash collection projections relative to the structure of the invoice hasn\u2019t changed significantly either. We see primarily getting cash a quarter in advance, a few customers that are semi annual on advance and just a couple that are annually in advance. So, just based on the mix of which accounts which customers are up for renewal that provides the opportunity.", "So, we built in a good recovery relative to the amount of receivables we had year-over-year, we factor in the expense management against that and there is always some small puts and takes to go through to end up with a fairly close cash flow item. Again, our operating income is we are holding that plight year-over-year, but there are higher taxes paid which again you don\u2019t just see in the actual tax rate on the P&L, but where actual tax payments would increase in 2010, and on top of that our operating income expense is slightly lower year-over-year which is contributing to the rest of that slight decline year-over-year.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And Aart, would your comment, which mirrors mentor and cadence that customers are waiting to the end of the contracts to renew. Based on that can you give us some qualitative commentary about how the renewal pipeline, if you will, looks as you move into fiscal 2010, meaning is the renewals get better in the back half, is it more back end loaded, is it linier, is it front-end loaded, how does the renewal pipeline look for you?", "Aart de Geus", "I actually don\u2019t know the answer in terms of specifically how it spreads over the year, we told you at a minimum that for us that is less relevant. I can tell you though is the very fact that we say that orders are quite a bit up from, expected to be quite a bit from the past year. Say that there is enough set of renewals so that we have incentivised our sales team to go after those.", "The other comment is really, again on the qualitative side is that we are maintaining the run rates just fine, and so that says that even in a very tough economic time, customers seems to value the value we provide sufficiently for us to achieve that result.", "So, I expect that as the economic situation gradually betters, the pressure will lessen a little bit although it may take a while for the high-tech segment to suddenly start spending a lot again. But, nonetheless, I think we\u2019ve probably seen, most likely seen the worse in \u201809 by far, and right now we are sort of a little bit back to business as normal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Market.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "You mentioned that the turning of the couple of large contracts was one of the reasons why the backlog is down. My question is as and when these contracts close next year, do you think there is upside to your conservative top-line guidance or is the closing of this contract already folded into your top-line outlook?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I think I choose the work carefully being, I think I used conservative and cautious for a reason, which is we think that this is a plan that is very executable and this is what we are working again. We factored out all other major actions that we could take and obviously if there is an opportunity to do better on any of these contracts that will manifest itself over time well in the top-line.", "So, no, I think we have been very realistic against a landscape that is just very hard to predict where we have learned some interesting lessons in \u201809.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. The primary EDA program, can you give us some understanding of how much do you guys typically see your business or orders of top-line increase or change with a customer versus before they became a EDA partner?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s a good question; it\u2019s a little bit all over the map. But, in general, I would say it doesn\u2019t change all that much initially for a very simple reason which is many of the customers needs to have time to gradually migrate to us. During that time they still have contracts with maybe other sources, and those contracts don\u2019t go away. And so, especially \u201809 that\u2019s not the time to ask them for more money.", "As they do a successful conversion to our tools, they now have the opportunity to either put the savings in their pocket or comeback to us for capabilities, and this is precisely an additional reason why we are feverishly investing in more technology going forward and are looking at other investments so that when the time is right there is an opportunity to build on that very platform.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "From a modeling market though, how should we evaluate the press releases which talks about primary EDA contracts.", "Aart de Geus", "I think the bottom line in press releases are just that, and as much as we would all probably take a lot of pride in having great press releases, some are extremely meaningful and some are complete, well, let me be polite in the word. And so, the thing that matters is really what happens underneath an over time, and I grand you that it\u2019s more difficult for you to observe that because it is a lot of engineering work to help people gradually solidify their position.", "One of the indicators that would be meaningful to you is the very fact that we say that our run rates are flat. And so, flat in a year where the entire markets collapse at the tune of substantial percentage. I should tell you that our customers seems to continue to have a strong confidence in what we do. So, time will actually show that these investments on our part and on their part will pay off for both of us. And we certainly feel very comfortable with that, the press releases are just that.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Lastly, you mentioned a couple of times of the changing landscape. Now, although, we can sort of guess what it means I would like to hear what your thoughts on how has the landscape changed over the past 12 to 13 months?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, leaving alone the very obvious massive financial changes for many customers, starting with the top-line and then in various ramifications to the bottom-line. In my opinion what is really happening is that we have a major push for substantial increase in efficiency in the entire high-tech industry. Certainly, therefore in the semiconductor industry, certainly therefore in all these supporting industries.", "And so, that is accompanied by a gradual but accelerating shift towards the Far East in terms of end markets now growing and on delivery of products they are growing. And so, all of these things spell out the same words, which is how we become more efficient, and part of that is you can see the consolidation of a number of customers, you have seen recently a couple of very large mergers in semiconductors, NCE with Renesas is probably the largest one. In the foundry domain we see global foundries chartered, and then there is a slew of smaller announcements that have followed.", "There is one common is theme, efficiency. And so, we are catering precisely to that because we are in the business of providing efficiency tool. So, this is a good time where customers are looking at how can they not only improve by virtue of scale, but also improve by virtue of execution. And one proof point for that would be the success of our IP business, because there is a good example of many customers doing things that are not differentiated where we can provide building blocks that are of high-quality and overall economically cheaper for them if they were to do it themselves.", "So, we are in the middle of this massive change and change always has unexpected ramifications but I think we are very well positioned to not only manage well through that change, but to take advantage of some of the opportunities that open up because of that.", "With that I\u2019m getting the sign here to wrap it up. It\u2019s past one-hour. I appreciate all the people calling in. There may have been more questions As usual Brian and I will be available right after the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, I will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys, and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this conference call, Synopsys will make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009 and in our earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report of Form 8-K that we filed today, our first quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I am happy to report that we started the year with great energy and momentum, and obtained excellent results in Q1. We delivered revenue in line with expectations, solid expense management, and earnings slightly above target. In addition, we made a number of strategic moves that we believe will increase our total available market substantially in the long-term. We feel that 2010 will be a year of positive evolution for Synopsys.", "Before I share some of our strategic perspectives with you, let me briefly summarize last quarter\u2019s financial results, where we met or exceeded all of our Q1 targets. Specifically, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41, with revenue of $330 million. Through disciplined expense control and focus on efficiency, we are on track to meet our ops margin target of 24% for the year. These results were achieved under our predictable business model, with more than 90% time-based revenue. With yet another strong set of technology deliveries and continued excellent field execution, we are solidly on track to meet our targets for the year.", "Now to our strategic direction. As we introduced to you in our last earnings call, we see 2010 and \u201811 as the time to benefit from the economic recovery, while actively broadening our opportunity space. We are pursuing three fundamental strategies. One, accelerate our execution momentum and expand our core EDA leadership. Two, broaden our EDA TAM [ph] by aggressively fielding adjacent products and capabilities. Three, expand our TAM outside of core EDA by aggressively driving the emerging systems space.", "Before elaborating on our strategies, let me briefly describe the customer environment that is the backdrop to our actions. Whereas the macro economy is still somewhat mixed, and most executives continue to be focused on risk and cost management, the plethora of new electronics applications will help semiconductors be one of the key growth segments in the economy going forward.", "Just looking at new products shown at the Consumer Electronics Show, one finds massive growth in mobile Internet devices ranging from smart \u2013 or I should say, very smart phones, to notebooks, netbooks, tablets, and e-book readers, all featuring the convergence of what used to be simpler, stand-alone applications. There are immense bandwidth and complexity drivers in high-definition, 3D video, and Internet protocol TVs. There are new growth opportunities in low-power management, smart grids, and automotive. And bringing it all together, we see mobility and Internet connectivity on a scale that dwarfs anything seen so far.", "With China and India consumer bases simultaneously expanding at a rapid clip, the growth opportunities for electronics appear very robust. For semiconductor executives, this landscape presents growth opportunities requiring redeployment of existing resources, even while the short-term economic situation forces a focus on cost management. This widely opens the doors for Synopsys.", "Designing and verifying all these complex new products requires great technological sophistication in chip design, but increasingly also in the crucial interaction between hardware and software, which brings me to our latest strategy acceleration, expanding our TAM outside of core EDA up into Systems. Over the past several quarters we have made great progress into this space. Specifically, we added major new capabilities in the automotive and consumer segments to augment our ability to model and verify complex systems.", "With the acquisition of VaST, we are not only adding a number of key connections to customers, we also added some important processor models and are already engaged with one of our primary EDA partners in this area. The addition of CoWare, which we announced last week, would grow our capabilities in the consumer space, most notably with strong relationships in Japan, and with technology aimed at verifying hardware and software simultaneously.", "One method to accomplish this is virtual prototyping. This capability is promising, as most system companies now perform these tasks internally in an ad-hoc fashion, yet are increasingly interested in outsourcing to a well-structured and complete commercial solution. Complemented by our FPGA-based rapid prototyping, our solution will compete well with more expensive and in unwieldy emulation products, enabling system validation on a much broader scale than before and allowing customers to accelerate embedded software development.", "Finally, in the systems area, I would like to highlight our silicon IP business, which is growing very nicely as the outsourcing of non-differentiating IP accelerates amid the convergence of cost pressures and the availability of high-quality products. We\u2019ve seen high demand for almost all of our titles, from analog IP to connectivity standards such as HDMI. One exciting example is the new USB 3.0 standard, which was highly visible at last month\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show.", "Synopsys has been the leading provider of USB interfaces for a while, and was the first to bring to market a complete IP solution of this latest incarnation. USB 3.0 is more than 10X faster than previous versions and capable of transmitting live high definition video. For example, a movie that used to take hours to load can now take just minutes. This opens the door to many exciting new products, and indeed the standard is rapidly gaining momentum. Super-speed USB 3.0 is a complex piece of IP with very sophisticated analog/mixed-signal capabilities, which brings me to our second strategy, broadening the Synopsys EDA TAM.", "In this area, Custom Designer is a great example of how we built a very competitive capability from scratch in a market segment that has seen limited innovation for a long time. In December, we released a greatly enhanced version, and with Synopsys having over 450 analog/mixed-signal designers, all of our new analog IP products are being designed using our own Custom Designer. In Q1, we also acquired a small company with excellent shape-based router technology that we believe will accelerate and expand our product differentiation.", "We\u2019ve already seen a number of customer tape-outs, including most recently a chip used in Digital Imaging Systems\u2019 high-performance camera modules. Another promising product is Yield Explorer, a recent addition that is finding traction with customers focused on improving their chip COGS by diagnosing yield issues and thereby accelerating yield ramp. It\u2019s another good example of growing our adjacent EDA capabilities by effectively straddling design and manufacturing.", "This brings me to the center of gravity of the company, our strong core EDA solution and our opportunity to further strengthen its category leadership. Our primary partner program continues to make excellent progress, as we help our customers reduce or at least stabilize their total cost of design, while providing increasingly integrated solutions with steadily improving productivity metrics. There are many examples of where this is happening. We continue to see migration to Synopsys and away from competitor tools.", "At one large customer, use of Synopsys\u2019 implementation and verification solutions increased from about 40% of total to about 90%. In another case, the customer was able to reduce the number of vendor tools from four to one. It\u2019s important to note that these transitions are not easily done, and they occur over time. So the very fact that we can see tangible progress is very positive. As we help our customers become more efficient and automated, they can increasingly re-purpose their most precious engineering talent towards more differentiating activities.", "In Q1, Synopsys again released a broad set of technology enhancements ranging from substantial multi-threaded, multi-core speed increases to major advances in integrating complete design flows. Our ability, for example, to do physical verification directly in the design flow with IC Validator saves substantial design time. At yet another large international customer, we are displacing our competition as they standardize on IC Validator for their 32 nanometer design flows. The strength of IC Compiler and the integration with IC Validator combine to provide a truly state-of-the-art physical implementation flow.", "The integration of VCS-based simulation and low-power verification is another example of great innovation rapidly increasing customer impact. Toshiba Information Systems, for example, was successful in verifying the low-power functionality of a mobile multimedia application, and they can now reuse the verification infrastructure for additional designs.", "In analog, TSMC has adopted CustomSim, which brings together multiple transistor-level simulations in an integrated solution, for its sub-40 nanometer memory INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY characterization. We also made a small acquisition in the simulation acceleration space, as we continue to invest in technology enhancements.", "Bringing this all together, our Lynx Design System helps customers who want to shift internal CAD management resources to more differentiating projects. For 65 nanometer and below, Lynx provides a comprehensive design system, with built-in methodologies, foundry-ready checks, and an advanced management cockpit. The complete low-power flow can be up and running in just a couple of weeks.", "In summary, Synopsys is executing very well and we are on the move to expanding our total available market. Our technology and support engines are providing our customers the best guarantees for success, and many of them now want to also engage more closely with us to help them differentiate with their customers. That means an expanded role that requires expertise beyond traditional EDA, down to manufacturing, and increasingly at the intersection of hardware and software. Our internal investments and recent acquisitions are all aimed at driving our strategy and growth in that direction, and 2010 promises to be an exciting year for Synopsys.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thanks, Aart. And good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our Q2 and 2010 guidance. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and financial supplement, which is posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "Now, as Aart highlighted, we continue to execute well, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. Total revenue was $330.2 million, well within our target range, with greater than 90% of Q1 revenue coming from beginning-of-quarter backlog. Our IP and systems business again performed very well, achieving double-digit growth in Q1 and the trailing four quarters. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue.", "Turning to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $275.1 million, which included $17 million of stock-based compensation, $10.7 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $1 million of acquisition related costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $244 million, which was slightly below our planned range and declined 2 percentage points compared to a year ago, even with the addition of the Analog Business Group from MIPS Technology.", "The decrease was driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses, including external professional services, some hiring, and other one-time expenses that shifted out of the quarter, along with company-wide cost control. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was 26.1% for the quarter, a very good start towards achieving our goal of approximately 24% for the entire year.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings were $0.88 per share, substantially above our target range and up from $0.37 a year ago. This was due to the one-time impact of a $91.6 million or $0.61 cents per share GAAP-only tax benefit associated with the IRS settlement for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. There was no non-GAAP P&L impact as a result of this settlement.", "Continuing on with earnings, non-GAAP earnings of $0.41 per share slightly exceeded our target range, due primarily to timing of our quarterly expenses. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.6% for the quarter. And for modeling purposes, we think that a 27% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for the full year.", "Our revenue visibility remains strong with greater than 90% coming from beginning-of-quarter backlog. Upfront revenue was 6% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was 3.2 years.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, which of course was prior to the VaST Systems acquisition we closed earlier this month. It also does not include the expected impact of the recently announced definitive agreement to purchase CoWare. Of our total cash balance, 49% is held within the United States. As expected, there was an operating cash outflow of $45.4 million in the quarter. This was due primarily to the typical Q1 payments of annual incentive compensation to our employees related to FY \u201809 performance.", "Continuing on with cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $8 million in the quarter. And for 2010, we now expect capital spending to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million, which includes planned expenditures to consolidate our Bay Area facilities to reduce long-term expenses. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 1.2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $25.3 million and have approximately $475 million remaining on our current authorization.", "As Aart highlighted, we are excited that we closed the acquisition of VaST Systems Technology as well as signed a definitive agreement to acquire CoWare. The terms of these deals are not being disclosed, but we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on 2010 revenue or our non-GAAP earnings for 2010. Over the past six quarters, we have closed five acquisitions, in addition to the definitive agreement to acquire CoWare. And as we\u2019ve recently highlighted, we are well positioned in 2010 to more aggressively put our balance sheet to work.", "Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $142 million and DSOs were 39 days, reflecting the high quality of our current AR portfolio and the timing of invoices. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $547 million. We ended the quarter with 5,875 employees. This was an expected year-over-year increase, due primarily to the acquisition of the Analog Business Group, but down slightly from our Q4 headcount.", "Now let me address our second quarter and fiscal 2010 guidance, which is a base case that naturally does not assume any future acquisitions or stock buybacks. For the second quarter of FY \u201810, our targets are, revenue between $331 million and $339 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $278 million and $295 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $252 million and $262 million; other income and expense between zero and $3 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between 148 million and 153 million; GAAP earnings of $0.22 to $0.28 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.40 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter\u2019s revenue to come from backlog.", "As a result, our current fiscal 2010 outlook is, revenues of approximately $1.33 billion to $1.35 billion; other income and expense between $4 million and $8 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 154 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.55 and $1.74, which reflects the one-time tax benefit I highlighted earlier and includes the impact of approximately $68 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.52 to $1.62; and we are targeting cash flow from operations of $200 million to $220 million.", "Finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some additional 2010 commentary for revenue and expenses. For the balance of the year, both total revenue and total expenses, we expect a sequential increase in Q2 followed by a moderate decline in Q3, with Q4 then showing a sharper sequential increase. For all of 2010, we currently expect to maintain our 2009 non-GAAP operating margin as well as operating income.", "In summary, we are pleased with our Q1 financial performance and are positioned very well for 2010 and beyond.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) And our first question will come from Richard Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Aart, I was wondering if you could give any qualitative commentary on bookings in the quarter, including any progress on the few slip deals you mentioned last quarter that from the 2009 into 2010?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. As you know, we don\u2019t give any specific color to the bookings expect for the fact that we have de facto reiterated that we are on track for this year and the bookings only support. So fundamentally, as expected, and my own sense is that business has returned to be a little bit more normal than the equivalent Q1 of last year, which of course was a very radical quarter in every aspect. So fundamentally we are in good shape.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Great. And I don\u2019t expect much of a change here, but in terms of renewal run rates, are you maintaining the flattish run rate that we\u2019ve been seeing for the past couple of quarters?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, I think flat to up is probably the way we would characterize it right now.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Great. And then with respect to CoWare, this technology has been around for a while. And I guess for a long time a sort of missionary sales that they can be getting some progress there in terms of accelerating the deployment into the market. Do you have any specific ideas of how you can accelerate the deployment of the CoWare tools in terms of both using your larger sales force and/or tying it together with some of your existing products?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, at this point in time, this deal is not closed. So it\u2019s a little early to give specific details on what we would do. But generally if you look at the systems area, it\u2019s a very broad space. And I think even in my intro comments, I made a couple of comments around the fact that in the core implementation of the application, people are really focusing on the productivity. In the systems space, they are really focusing on how do they get the attention of their customers. And that increasingly mean how can they best support the development of applications that are exciting, and therefore the whole interaction of this boundary between the hardware and the application software is growing in\u00a0importance. And so I think you\u2019re correct in stating that the whole systems arena has been a missionary arena for a long time, but (inaudible) is starting to come here.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then finally, Asia-Pac looked like it was pretty strong from a revenue perspective this quarter. Is there anything beyond sort of normal quarterly noise in there, or should we \u2013 is there anything more we could read into that as far as the strength of Asia-Pac?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I don\u2019t think you can read anything in the specific number for the quarter because these tend to fluctuate. I\u2019ve always been saying, hey, you have to look at the longer period of time, and there you would see that Asia-Pac of course has been doing well, which is not a surprise given the sharp evolution of the economies that are involved there, and I expect that to gradually continue over the coming years.", "Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question in queue that will come from the line of Ryan Goodman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Goodman \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, guys, thanks. I had a question on the OpEx. I think I understand there is going to be a bit of an uptick in the guidance for the next quarter and that sounds like more of a timing issue. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it, but you lowered the share count a little bit in the FY \u201910 forecast, but there was no change at the EPS level. Any chance you could just add some color what\u2019s going on there?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, Ryan. What we\u2019ve looked at is a lot of the expense savings that we saw in the year, as I said, related to primarily some of the external professional services, some of the hiring and other costs. And anticipation is most of that shifts in the Q2 and beyond in the quarter. From our other areas, we are just continuing. Of course, we have to acquire the assets and people from the VaST Technology stream that\u2019s built into our guidance as well, starting this quarter and moving through the rest of the year. And other than that, our share count is down slightly. We did a small buyback in the first quarter of just over 1 million shares. And I think we\u2019ll start seeing the impact of that. And of course, it ties to the price of the stock as well that\u2019s in the guidance.", "Ryan Goodman \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, cool. Thanks. And then on the cash flow, I noticed that didn\u2019t move as well. It was a little better than I had modeled. And it seems to just be after a better start on the year. I\u2019m still \u2013 I know this came up last quarter too, but can you talk a bit about why you are taking what I would consider a bit of a conservative bias there? I mean, it seems like revenue is doing fine, the bookings in particular are looking to be a good year. So why guide where you are in the cash flow now?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, I\u2019d say, first off, we have a very good forecast and our history has become very, very close to those cash forecast because of the way we profile out planned collections by customer by quarter over the next three years. So it\u2019s fairly close to the actual profile, and that gives you the most collection item. And then you\u2019ve also got your expenses, which we have to manage. So again the fact we are reiterating a positive cash flow of $200 million to $220 million is a pretty strong signal. We\u2019ve started a negative 48, which is pretty typical, which is even better than last year\u2019s numbers. But as you see, it really ties into the net income flow and it does over time match up with the EBITDA less the taxes paid in a long-term profile. So we think it\u2019s very appropriate. We still have three years of the year to go, and we will get tighter as we get through, but we are fairly confident with $200 million to $220 million range for \u201910.", "Ryan Goodman \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, great. And then I just have kind of a high level question for what you\u2019re seeing out there. In terms of the semiconductor market itself, I mean it\u2019s been out to a nice start for the year. R&D spending looks to be fairly well, but there is already starting to be some chatter that there is going to be an inventory build, which could catch up with the semiconductor market, at least by the back half of the year. Could you talk a little bit about implications you see for that just to the EDA market in general?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Fundamentally, we see that there are very few implications because what you\u2019re describing, we have already seen for the last quarter as we talked to semiconductor executives because they knew that they were replenishing inventory, they knew that the first half was probably going to look pretty solid and probably the second half ultimately \u2013 the market needed to find a natural balance. For EDA, we are a relatively stable industry, and for Synopsys specifically, I think we are in a very good shape, because if there is one thing that the semiconductor execs will continue to do is they will stay careful on their expenses. And therefore there is going to be a continued attention to how productive can they be with their tools, and that has certainly been the core tenant of our main strategy for a while and thus I think we can help them to be successful.", "Ryan Goodman \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question in queue that will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I have three questions. The first one is, the comment about the run rate being flat to up, can you characterize what\u2019s driving that contract\u2019s run rate value? Is it that you actually are getting more licenses per engineer or more products? What constitutes the value in that run rate being flat to up?", "Aart de Geus", "How many ways can I say yes? It is absolutely that we are rolling out more technology, the utilization is up. And fundamentally, we have the benefit of a number of customers that are gradually migrating towards us. And so it\u2019s fundamentally [ph] yes to your question.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "And I guess the pushback is, I wasn\u2019t looking for a yes or no. We are in an economy where unemployment is 10%. There is also arguments as to how much that hit the R&D engineering department and your core customer base. I think it\u2019s great that it\u2019s flat to up. I think it\u2019s a positive sign, and I was hoping that\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear. But I often get questions from clients saying that they just have better utilization with more licenses per engineer, or is it that because of the smaller design nodes, it\u2019s all about more products per \u2013 that are needed to design. So I think there is just an \u2013 to connect the dots and understanding that\u2019s needed by the investors, to understand how the run rates can grow from here.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. I apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to be flip at all. Let me take it in layers. The first layer is, with the exception of last year seeing a few companies disappear, where a number of certainly of the top engineers got rehired. I\u2019m sure there are some people that are unemployed. But in general, I would say in the engineering ranks with chip design, we have not seen massive lay-offs. We see people really trying to tune their companies and reduce their out-of-pocket expenses. But they all know very well that the engineering resources are very precious. So, no major change there. Secondly, we do see that a number of engineers are using more copies of given software per engineer, and this is especially true in areas such as the application where, be it simulation of some of the other tools, the more you do, the better the product gets.", "Third, we do see that people are still moving forward towards the more advanced node and the more advanced nodes do have a number of capability requirements that do stress the extremes of the tools. And so people will try to buy the best possible tool they can get, and we are often in that class. So all of these have moved together, and I cannot say that I see a sharp downturn economically in terms of engineering utilization or engineering period at this point in time for the last 15 months. And similarly, I don\u2019t think that there is going to be a sharp upturn because people will remain focused on cost, but that is actually not bad for Synopsys as we are very much focused on their productivity per engineer.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "Got it. Next question is for Brian. In terms of the expense timing, as you mentioned contractors, but can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of was there anything in terms of either will it be sales commission on timing of deals or do you have maybe more accruals because the G&A line seemed to be an area that came in much lower than I would have expected in the quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "You\u2019re right. It was all the areas other than commission. They basically came in per the plan, but it was really under-spending of some of our legal costs, some of the other G&A-type expenses that we had for the quarter. Hiring across the board, really just a start out of the first quarter, we had a one week shutdown, for example, which helped take down our expenses in the quarter as well. And again, that is back to business as usual in the second quarter. So just shifting out those expenses through Q2 through Q4.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And last question is, on the cash from operations, the improvement that you saw year-over-year, can you connect the dots for me in terms of was there anything there from the tax payment, was there anything there in terms of whether the compensation level that you pay in the first quarter may be not as big as what you saw last year? What were the big items that help that improvement year-over-year?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. I\u2019d characterize, again, a reduction that was nice, about $80 million in the prior year. This year it came in about $40 million as an outflow still and primarily related to lower expenses that we saw in the fourth quarter. The actual payments in terms of variable compensation are down year-over-year. And I think that is what contributed to the performance, plus again it\u2019s very susceptible to cash collections from particular customers or cash outflows. And I think that kind of characterizes mostly related to still some lower expenses under variable compensation in 2009.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "All right. Thank you.", "Brian Beattie", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we will take our next question in queue from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Ticonderoga Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Brian, another cash flow question. In terms of getting to your range for fiscal \u201910, would it be fair to assume that given the net income outlook for the year that you would have to have something in the order of a $50 million to $60 million improvement in working capital versus fiscal \u201909, for example, in accounts receivable, deferred and the like. And if so, could you perhaps talk about how you achieve that level of improvement implied for fiscal \u201910? Secondly, with respect to the acquisitions of CoWare and VaST, would it be fair to assume that given how small they are and also given the services requirement of their respective businesses that neither is particularly profitable and perhaps you could talk about ways that you can improve upon that profitability once you\u2019ve acquired them?", "Brian Beattie", "I\u2019ll maybe take the second question first, Jay, in a way looking at the acquisition. In our guidance, we have included the VaST acquisition since it has closed. And CoWare, as you know, is subject to the normal government reviews and so it will be factored into our guidance going forward. Nonetheless we indicated that they would not be material to the FY \u201910 revenues or to the earnings impact. And with every deal, we look at the expense state to identify the synergies. We look at the key skills that are required to deliver what we build as our business case. And obviously, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve done it. And we\u2019ve done, I\u2019d say, as I said, five acquisitions in the last six quarters, with one more pending. And so we\u2019ve gotten very good at the integration process and the flow through there, and still are targeting on the same level of operating margins we have while we expand into additional segments to expand our TAM.", "If I look at the overall cash flow for the year, I think it\u2019s very consistent on a year-over-year basis. This year, the guidance of $200 million to $220 million compares to $37 million. It matches up with some of the slight reductions we\u2019re seeing on the earnings level. Most of those earnings, as you know, relate really to the non-operational items that we saw coming into the year. The other income and expense, some of the foreign exchange impacts, a slightly higher tax rate, as we shifted from \u201909 to \u201910, and it\u2019s very consistent with that net income shift. The rest related to working capital is very consistent. Industry leading DSOs in the 30s and our collections are looking very, very well, even stronger than what we saw in \u201909 as we now exited through the recession and our customer environment. So again, very confident, and $200 million to $220 million for FY \u201909 operating cash flow.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "Two follow-up questions. Aart, on the last call, you mentioned a new metric, logo profitability. And I\u2019m wondering if you could describe any notable trends you may be seeing there across your largest customers. In other words, are there any significant differences among your larger customers in terms of profitability and for the ones that may not be so profitable? What are the ways to improve upon that? And then finally, there was an enlargement in your duration where Cadence had somewhat a shorter duration in the last quarter. So a little bit more of a gap between the two of you now in duration. Perhaps you could comment on that.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I\u2019ll be careful to talk about logo profitability given that every customer would like to know about everybody else how well they are doing, and it\u2019s non-stop looking at ways to improve their own outlook. What I was probably alluding to although I must confess I don\u2019t quite recall what I said at that time, is that we are in a face of the industry where efficiency, productivity, profitability actually really matters. And therefore many customers are focusing on how can they become more effective in the task that they are doing potentially at lower cost, potentially with fewer people in order to be able to invest more in those areas where they can differentiate more.", "And in that sense, we ourselves follow the same line of thinking, which is how can we execute as well as possible all the things that we have done so far while investing and growing the total available market around us. And so we have to live up in many ways to the same profitability improvement objectives internally as our customers do, and I think we\u2019re pretty much in line with that thinking. Regarding duration, fundamentally we\u2019ve said for long time we are very steady around the three years that can go up 3.2, 3.3. It can go down to 2.6, 2.7, 2.8. It varies from one quarter to another. But in essence, our business model is remarkably stable. And so far so good with that. I have no indication of change whatsoever.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Ticonderoga Securities", "Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question in queue that will come from the line of K.C. Rajkumar with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, guys. How would you characterize the EDA spend for the year? Cadence had made an estimate of 1% to 6%. Would you say that\u2019s a right ballpark?", "Aart de Geus", "We can comment only about really our numbers at this point in time. We are extremely stable in our core businesses. As you can see, we are now investing in some of the areas that would not traditionally be called Core EDA, and we see great opportunities there. I think 2010 is far from over. Earlier, somebody mentioned that customers on one hand were optimistic about the first half because they see a lot of demand for the business and indeed even some shortcomings in manufacturing capacity. They are still very cautious for the second half. And all of that tells me that it\u2019s probably going to be fairly steady for the year. But we certainly had a very good Q1 and feel strong about our year. And so that\u2019s the answer and that\u2019s only when it comes [ph] for Synopsys.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "When you talk to your customers, do you guys sense that they are planning to increase their EDA spend on average this year compared to last year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think that on the Core EDA, they will probably stay very focused on how to improve the efficiency. And I think they are going to increasingly look at where to put their R&D money to see if they can increase their differentiation when interacting with their customers. And there are a number of areas where they can obviously do that because you can\u2019t differentiate by having smaller chips and cheaper chips, and that takes an enormous amount of very sophisticated engineering work. And we are well equipped to help them with that, which can also differentiate by providing more of a system solution. And the term system-on-a-chip is actually well chosen about ten years because we are here today and we can see that more than 50% of the engineering employees in our customers are already software employees. And so I suspect that we will see more spending in that direction. And by the way, that\u2019s one of the key reasons why we have also invested in broadening our TAM in that same arena.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. You folks mentioned that you don\u2019t want to expect material revenue and EPS (inaudible) from VaST and CoWare this year. Would you expect something along the lines of (inaudible) next year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the first year in acquisitions like this, they are all with financial haircut. There is a partial year and so on. And I think we made very clear statements that for this year it\u2019s fairly immaterial. Obviously, we do this with the whole purpose to grow our business. And so yes, it will have an impact on next year and moreover we think that our system strategy will have even more momentum than it\u2019s already starting to see.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And I guess looking to consolidate the various assets that you guys have acquired in systems into one continuous product so that it can better leverage or serve them and (inaudible).", "Aart de Geus", "Well, one has to understand that the system arena is actually a huge market. There are many different things that go under that banner. And many things that are interacting from deep software involvement to very sophisticated hardware application techniques, all the way to touching some of the physical edges and looking at the optimization of architectures. And I\u2019m just naming a few here. And so what is interesting is that the focus on this area is growing as the customers are starting to see an opportunity to differentiate themselves more there.", "And obviously there are different bets. And earlier, one of the speakers mentioned the fact that the term missionary endeavor was very appropriate for the last decade or so. Well, I think at this point in time, there are so many technical challenges in this area around verifying systems, around modeling complex IP, there are many opportunity for us. And so certainly from an infrastructure point of view, we will seek out immediately efficiency, but from a technology roadmap point of view, I think we will talk about that when we are much further along.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Lastly, into this year and next year, would you see the systems and the IP segments as going faster for you guys than EDA \u2013 than the Core EDA?", "Aart de Geus", "The answer in general terms is yes. And we\u2019ve seen that already with IP. These are new areas. They are today at least in the markets that we play in much smaller than what we do in Core EDA or adjacencies to that. But the problems that it\u2019s quite substantial. And so yes, we do think that there will be more growth there and that is precisely the reason why we are investing there.", "K.C. Rajkumar \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re most welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we have no additional questions in queue. Please continue with any closing remarks.", "Aart de Geus", "In that case, thank you very much for spending time with us. We are looking back on a strong Q1 and we are looking forward actually to a year that\u2019s shaping up in very interesting terms for us. And as usual, Brian and I will be available for any questions or comments that you have afterwards. Have a good rest of the afternoon.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Inc. Earnings Conference Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2010. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Lola. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys will make forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2010, and in our earnings release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information, can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our second quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I am pleased to report that in Q2, we again delivered solid results with in-line revenue, good expense management, slightly above target earnings and strong cash generation. Moreover, we made good progress increasing our total available market for long-term growth.", "Over the past several years, we have been executing on all fronts. R&D investment, global customer support and targeted acquisitions, all resulting in very solid financials, as we have emerged as a clear industry leader.", "Let me first summarize last quarter's financial results. We met or exceeded all of our Q2 targets. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41, with revenue of $338 million. We carefully managed expenses and are on track to meet our ops margin target of 24% for the year, and we're heading towards meeting or beating our initial revenue, EPS and cash flow objectives for the year.", "Before reporting on our strategy and execution, let me address the economic landscape that our customers are navigating and its impact on EDA [electronic design automation] and Synopsys. While the worldwide economy is gradually recovering, the semiconductor industry has experienced a rapid increase in demand. Companies are ramping up chip production as quickly as possible. Most of our customers have reported solid results, are seeing a strong six-month outlook, and in many cases, are reporting capacity shortages.", "Simultaneously, they do remain cautious, as there is an ongoing focus on cost throughout the supply chain. Semiconductor executives continue to reassess every part of their business and are moving resources to the most value-added functions and projects. Although I would continue to characterize the EDA market as challenging overall, Synopsys is well-positioned to help customers, both in terms of cost and productivity focus and also with the need to accelerate innovation and differentiation.", "Indeed, we continue to be the supplier of choice for many of these companies. And again in Q2, several customers chose us as their primary EDA partner, including Yamaha, a leader in audio and graphics chips. As companies look at increased differentiation though, through a combination of hardware and software, they find Synopsys a ready partner to drive this emerging quest forward. ", "Having said that, the implications of the customer landscape on near term EDA growth are mixed. On the challenging side of the ledger, we see cautious buyers, continued customer consolidation, considerable competitive pressures and core EDA budgets that are not growing.", "On the positive side however, the adoption of 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer and below design nodes is accelerating. IP reuse-based design methodologies are growing, hardware/software co-verification is becoming a necessity and integrated design flows are demonstrating substantial productivity benefit.", "For Synopsys, this is good news. We continue to lead the industry in advance designs all the way below 28-nanometer, and our highly-tuned product portfolio can handle the most difficult complexity challenges. Our IP is very strong. The interest in system solution is rapidly growing and our R&D engine continues to keep us in a strong technology position.", "So notwithstanding the overall market challenges, we have been able to hold average run rates roughly flat and are focusing on near-term growth efforts towards the IP and systems adjacencies. Consequently, our strategy remains unchanged: One, maintain our technology momentum, increase our efficiency and expand our core EDA leadership; two, broaden our core EDA TAM by fielding adjacent products and capabilities; three, expand our TAM beyond core EDA by aggressively driving the emerging IP and systems space.", "Let me begin with some highlights around core EDA. Our R&D investments continue to pay off. Not only have we made outstanding progress in providing leading solutions for the most advanced nodes, but we're also innovating in-house to optimize the design flows for substantial productivity improvements. Indeed, for the second year in a row, our Galaxy Design platform has won the EDN Magazine Innovation Award. The driver this year was IC Validator, which integrates physical verification with IC Compiler physical design.", "With our In-Design technology, designers can now perform physical verification checks and repairs during design, thereby reducing late stage surprises and unnecessary iterations. Feedback from customers is strongly positive and adoption is progressing ahead of expectations. Driven by the integration of IC Validator and IC Compiler, one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world selected Synopsys to displace the incumbent.", "In verification, our VCS simulator holds large lead in customer usage for advance designs. In addition, we're increasingly beating the competition in more mature process nodes, with two competitive displacements in Q2, based primarily on better performance and memory efficiency. In manufacturing, Renesas Adopts [Renesas Adopts Proteus OPC], our optical proximity correction for advanced 28-nanometer developments. By providing customers the best combination of accuracy and run-time performance, we can enable a shorter, more cost-effective development cycle. ", "Now to efforts to broaden our core EDA TAM. Our most notable focus has been the rapid maturing of Custom Designer, our analog/mixed-signal design tool. We now have not only a complete solution but also compelling differentiation, in terms of ease of use and open architecture and tight integration with other Synopsys tools. The quality and size of engagement opportunities have steadily increased, yielding several customer wins, including a competitive displacement at a company designing advanced network IPs.", "In addition, from reprocess design kits (sic) [process design kits] or PDK support is growing for processes across the board from 180, all the way to 28-nanometer. Another new product, Yield Explorer, is also generating notable customer interest, as it accelerates yield ramp by diagnosing yield issues during design, where major semiconductor companies successfully use Yield Explorer for 90-nanometer and 40-nanometer design, and is now broadly deploying the solution through their organization.", "And finally, let me address our efforts beyond the core, up into the IP and systems domain. This area is growing well, both organically and through acquisitions. Our strategic vision and investments of the last 10 years are coming together at exactly the right time. Today, IP and systems represent approximately 13% of our total revenue and is rapidly approaching $200 million in annual business for us. ", "IP had a very strong Q2, with many large semiconductor and systems firms making purchases. The drivers for this success are the following: Major [ph] buy decisions have accelerated, as customers stringently evaluates their cost structures and refocus their engineering on differentiation; in addition, post-recession time to market pressures have increased, forcing customers to quickly move to the new connectivity standards.", "Since Synopsys not only provides a broad catalog of these IP titles, but also has a strong reputation for quality and performance, we're the natural choice to partner in this area.", "One of those titles is USB 3.0, also called SuperSpeed USB, a rapidly growing new standards that provide 10x speed up over the previous generation. Synopsys was the first IP vendor to pass compliance and certification testing for SuperSpeed USB, and our product won the EDA Innovation Award for IP this year.", "We are also seeing strong business in areas such as HDMI and DDR, on both the analog and digital side. During the quarter, we announced our new DDR multi-PHY, which supports multiple standards on a single physical core without sacrificing power or area. Our development importing engines are cranking with dozens of new versions released each quarter.", "Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world, second only to ARM, and is the number one supplier of interface and analog IP.", "Complementary to our IP focus is our systems strategy. In Q2, we bolstered our already strong offering in algorithmic design and virtual prototyping by closing acquisitions of VaST, a leading supplier of virtual prototypes for automotive and consumer; and CoWare, the industry's broadest and largest supplier of system level tools. The integration of both companies is proceeding with good customer feedback and engagements.", "We've also further strengthened our portfolio with the introduction of our next-generation rapid prototyping. The new system doubled the size of designs that can be prototyped on a single board, while increasing prototyping speeds by 30%. Customer demand is very high, and we're selling these systems as fast as we can build them.", "Synopsys has the most comprehensive set of solutions in the IP and systems space and is the clear leader in enabling our customers to accelerate software development, raise the level of design abstraction for efficient chip design and have access to a rich set of IP and model.", "In summary, Q2 was a solid quarter for Synopsys. We maintained average run rates and made progress in our broadened core EDA TAM. We executed particularly well in IP. We substantially solidified our emerging systems offering. And last but not least, we delivered strong financial results and have a balance sheet that gives us many opportunities going forward.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our Q3 and 2010 guidance.", "As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We provided reconciliations in the press release and the financial supplement, which are posted on our website.", "In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Now as Aart highlighted, we delivered solid Q2 results, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in February. Additionally, we continued our stock repurchase program, closed three acquisitions and generated considerable operating cash flow.", "Now let me provide some additional detail in our financials. Total revenue increased slightly to $338.1 million, at the high end of our target range, with greater than 90% of Q2 revenue coming from beginning of quarter backlog. Our IP and Systems business did very well this quarter, driven primarily by continued strength in our IP cores.  One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue. ", "Turning to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $293.1 million, which included $13.5 million of stock-based compensation, $11.8 million of amortization of intangible assets and $6.1 million of acquisition-related costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $257.3 million, an expected year-over-year and sequential increase and well within our target range. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to acquisitions, while the sequential increase was driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses that we explained last quarter.", "As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was 23.9% for the quarter and 25% for the first half of fiscal 2010. For all of 2010, we are well on track to achieving our non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 24%.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.41 per share, slightly exceeding our target range. Our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27% for the quarter. And for modeling purposes, we think that a 27% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for the full year.", "Greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 4% of total, well within our target range of less than 10%. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was approximately 2.5 years, influenced by one large two-year contract.", "This metric will fluctuate quarterly, depending on the mix of contracts signed, but we continue to expect average duration to be approximately three years.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains very strong, with approximately $1.08 billion in cash and short-term investments, which takes into account our stock buybacks and acquisitions during the quarter. Of our total cash balance, about 50% is held within the United States. We generated approximately $82 million in cash from operations in the quarter and we are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $205 million to $225 million.", "Capital expenditures were $6 million on the quarter and $14 million for the first half of fiscal 2010. For all of 2010, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million.", "At this time, let me briefly outline our current cash strategy, which outlines the following elements: Maintain a high quality conservative risk profile for our cash portfolio; retain maximum financial flexibility; and prudently invest our cash to generate long-term shareholder value, including stock repurchases and disciplined M&A or a combination of both.", "Now as you know, over the years, we've been active in both stock repurchases and acquisitions. We used approximately $370 million during fiscal '07 and '08 to repurchase over 15 million shares of Synopsys stock. We are not active in repurchasing stock in '09 based on the global economic environment.", "Now each quarter, we evaluate the best uses of our cash. Our goal for the time being is to use stock repurchases to try to keep our share count roughly flat with first quarter levels, and then to continue to look for the right acquisitions to add to our company. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $25 million and have approximately 450 million remaining on our current authorization.", "We've also been very active on the M&A front, closing six acquisitions during the last 12 months. Now while we contemplated a number of acquisitions during the quarter, we closed three. CoWare, VaST and a small company in the smart verification space, all of which were initially funded from our U.S. cash balance.", "Now continuing on with our balance sheet items. Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $149.7 million, and we maintained an industry-leading DSO of 40 days, reflecting the high quality of our current AR portfolio. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $544 million and we ended Q2 with approximately 6,000 employees. While we have selectively grown our headcount, primarily through acquisitions, we continue to have more than a third of our total employees in lower-cost geographies.", "Now let me address our third quarter and fiscal 2010 guidance. For the third quarter of FY '10, our targets are: Revenues between $330 million and $338 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $275 million and $292 million, which includes approximately $14 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $251 million and $261 million; other income and expense between zero and $3 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%; outstanding shares between $149 million and $154 million; GAAP earnings of $0.21 to $0.27 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.36 to $0.38 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our current fiscal 2010 outlook. We're slightly raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.34 billion and $1.355 billion . At this time, we expect revenue from our second quarter acquisitions to be very modest, primarily reflecting the purchase accounting haircut that is applied to deferred revenue.", "Other income and expense between $4 million and $8 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 27%, outstanding shares between $149 million and $154 million, GAAP earnings between $1.56 and $1.75 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $58 million in stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 to $1.62 per share, and we're maintaining our guidance range, even taking into account the small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions.", "Now as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of $205 million to $225 million.", "To conclude, we are pleased with another quarter of consistent execution. In addition to delivering solid financial results, we are investing in new and exciting areas that we believe will help drive the next growth cycle for Synopsys. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And first we'll go to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Aart, you mentioned a number of challenging factors in the customer environment, but could you talk about how it compares with one quarter ago or maybe two quarters ago, has it roughly stabled, sort of unchanged or has anything changed to be more challenging in that time period?", "Aart de Geus", "I would say that in general, it's become more positive. No question about that, in terms of the outlook from our customers. Now they are all reporting the same thing, which is a lack of capacity, thus pricing going up and all in all, that doesn't feel bad for them. Having said that, their sale are maintaining, their watchfulness on the cost side of the equation. And I think that as more money becomes available from an R&D point of view, that money will go on those areas where there can be more differentiation. One key [ph] of evidence for that would be the very fact that we've seen some of these -- the number of designs in 40-nanometer actually tweak up. So that's not a surprise, because last year actually, it sort of slowed down, and now people are catching up. So all in all, I would say it's a better environment.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Would you consider the competitive environment similar to a quarter ago? And how would you say pricing has averted? An anecdotal account of at least one large renewal where there was apparently some very aggressive pricing to try to take share. Can you characterize the competitive environment?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well I think it finally hasn't changed all that much. I think companies are either trying to survive or trying to grow. Typically, if you have a market that overall is not changing all that much, that makes for a very competitive market. But then you know, I mean they can't be all thinking that it's always been very competitive and that the rate for technology keeps going, and over time, that's what determine how well the company does. I don't know about any specific deal that you're referring to, but I can only communicate that on the large things we been doing. We've been able to maintain essentially a flattish run rate of slightly positive, so far so good for us.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "So would you characterize bookings as on track for the year, relative to expectation?", "Aart de Geus", "Absolutely.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Brian, with respect to the acquisitions, can you give us a little more sense of the revenue contribution? I mean, can we assume that your base revenue as a sense for guidance was essentially unchanged and that the incremental addition is from the acquisitions? And also on the dilution front, can you give us any sense of how many EPS of dilution there might have been?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, absolutely. When you look at our guidance for the year, we have factored in the three new acquisitions into that guidance, and effectively tightened our range and raised that slightly to reflect that. The core business itself, all of the existing business is right on track for the year as well. So we've raised it, just really to reflect the acquisitions in there. As you know, with software purchase accounting, there's very significant haircuts that come in, and we indicated that while the expenses fully come in as the employees come on board, we did reflect about a half a quarter of expenses in the base. So it becomes slowly diluted for the year, as what we indicated. And not withstanding that, held on to the total EPS guidance that we issued earlier. And then looking out to next year, clearly, we'd expect still some impact from that haircut, from the deferred revenues that we acquire, but clearly, that will be built into our revenue guidance that we projected in December for FY '11.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Do you think they could be neutral or accretive next year?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, typically again, these are smaller type deals. They're typically dilutive for the first 12 months. So I think we'd start to see a positive contribution from those in FY '11.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And next, we'll go to the line of K.C. Rajkumar with RBC Capital Markets.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "With half the year behind you guys, what's your sense for next year? In particular, what would you say is the basis order of contract expiry into fiscal '11? Is it more first half loaded or is it more like second half loaded?", "Aart de Geus", "Obviously, we'll give more precise guidelines at the beginning of the year. But I don't think that there's anything that is out of the ordinary in terms of more or less renewals. And one of the positives of course of our model is that it is extremely stable, and that we managed the backlog in such a fashion that we have an ongoing good cash flow and good profitability level. On the other hand, it's also true that we will gradually come out of the recession because the contracts are very stable. And once that is the case, then there's an opportunity to work with customers, say, what else do you need, and have you grown your R&D expenses?. So we are really preparing for that late in the year '11.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Have you folks seen any change in the year-over-year from your customers based out of Europe?", "Aart de Geus", "Not really. As a matter of fact, we've done reasonably well in Europe, given the situation that the entire continent is facing. I think the question mark, that's the macro question mark, not just for us but in general, is going to be what are the currency fluctuations that come out of the fact that Europe is now going through the realigning of some of its issues, but that has nothing to do with us. And so overall, in Europe, we've done quite well and that includes by the way, good efforts on the Custom Designer side, where we've had some very active and very successful customers with it.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "Which leads me to ask Brian, are you guys adequately hedged to currency fluctuations?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, we are. The company has a full hedging program, and I'd just lay it out for a second for you. All of our revenue currencies, our U.S. dollars, except for the yen, and we effectively hedged on a rolling basis going forward for revenues. So we're already as you'd imagine, halfway covered through FY '11 on the hedge for revenues. In the other currencies in the countries we operate, where local currencies come into effect, we have all the major currencies hedged and we have a rolling forecast of those hedges. So again, no surprises as we approach the year. We'd anticipate having 60%, 70%, 80% even, of all our expenses fully hedged, both expenses and revenues, for a matter of fact. So we'd be very good shape and very predictable.", "K.C. Rajkumar - RBC Capital Markets", "And lastly from my side, would you have any comments as sort as to your IP for systems concerned, with regards to the recent acquisition by Cadence of Denali?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I don't think it changes much, in terms of the overall landscape. We clearly have invested in this area now for a long period of time, and have built a, not only a great portfolio but also a great business model and a great ability to deliver high quality. Now in parallel to that, we, as you have seen recently, have increased our efforts to also provide the systems of verification and design solution, and the CoWare and VaST acquisitions were just recent manifestations of that. But obviously, in the last two years before that, we have already invested there. And so as we're looking at this picture, it is only our believers that turned amount of the, or a substantial amount of the functionality is moving from the chips to the System-on-Chip, and the System-on-Chip, by virtue of its terminology, includes those software and hardware. And as a matter of fact, most semiconductor vendors have more than half of their engineers on the software. And so our business really is in three dimensions, that is the systems dimension, the RTL and its physical dimension, and all three are quite well aligned for that.", "Operator", "And I'd now like to turn it back for closing remarks.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, that was quick. I assume that, that means that our comments were what you were looking for. As usual, we are available for questions afterwards, and we appreciate the time you've spent with us. Have a good rest of the day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you, for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Davidson & Co.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Simran Brar", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Synopsys Inc.'s Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Beth. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2010, and in our earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our first quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that we started off fiscal 2011 with a strong first quarter, putting us well on track towards meeting our objectives for the year. This is all the more promising against the backdrop of a healthy semiconductor industry. Because Synopsys benefits from a clear industry leadership position, we continue to drive state-of-the-art technology in traditional EDA, and we have achieved a meaningful scale in high-growth adjacencies, such as IP. ", "From a financial perspective, we delivered revenue of $364.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44. The run rate of the underlying business grew and the outlook for Q2 looks promising. Brian will give you more details in a minute, but let me first make some comments on the current customer landscape. ", "Overall, our customers communicate a healthy outlook. This confidence is visible in the increased capital expenditures by all the large foundries and IDM, as well as an exciting end market. The wave of new products continues across the board, from consumer goods, such as tablets and smartphones, to new offerings in the industrial, automotive, communication and networking domains. Simply stated, we have entered the age of smart everything, and electronics will become still more pervasive, offering good growth opportunities for Synopsys. ", "The quest for leading edge silicon to drive advanced products is also visible in the urgency with which our leading customers are driving to new process nodes. 32/28 nanometer designs are ramping quickly, and 22-, 20-nanometer and below developments are in full swing. The complexity and cost of these efforts translate into continued opportunity for Synopsys as they require both advanced EDA and IP. ", "Against this backdrop, our stated growth objective for the next few years aims at achieving annual high-single digit earnings per share growth. We plan to achieve our objective with five strategies: one, drive organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for our traditional EDA products; two, achieve double-digit organic growth in our IP and systems adjacencies; three, continue to explore M&A opportunities that broaden our total available market; four, focus on corporate efficiency and allocate resources towards the growing segments in our market; and five, maintain a roughly flat diluted share count of around 151 million shares. In Q1, we executed well on all strategy, and we are well on the way  towards our EPS objective for the year. ", "Let me briefly share some highlights starting with the traditional EDA part of our business. In Q1, we saw a strong demand for our products. Both our contract renewals and a number of incremental sales led to positive growth of our business run rate. Specifically, adoption of our physical implementation solution around IC Compiler is growing with yet another customer deciding to migrate to us after having experienced difficulty in achieving closure with competitive tools. We also made excellent progress with a top graphics company moving to Synopsys for its next advanced chip design. ", "Overall, we continue to deliver very well from a technology point of view. The summary of our physical design solution achieved a 50% runtime improvement for IC Compiler while adding a powerful new optimization technique for large hierarchical designs. We delivered significant advances in analog simulation, including multicore features, resulting in notable performance improvements. The upcoming DCS simulator release is designed to deliver an amazing 2x speed up in runtime. ", "And in manufacturing, we shipped a new release of Yield Explorer, which achieved higher productivity by being tightly integrated with our physical design solution. In custom design, we continue to see gradual adoption. One European customer selected Synopsys for both simulation and design after a significant competitive evaluation, and another technology leader chose us for the development of IP for their 20-nanometer process node. Finally, IC Validator, our integrated physical verification solution, continues its customer base expansion with qualification for TSMC 40- and 65-nanometer processes and excellent adoption by customers. ", "Now let me turn to our high-growth adjacencies, which continue to deliver strong business for us. The IP and systems area will represent about 20% of our revenue in 2011. Thus, reaching scale that is meaningful in driving top-line growth. IP had another excellent quarter as we continue to integrate the Virage acquisition from last year and systematically deliver high-demand IP titles. ", "More and more customers are actively seeking to outsource what are, for them, non-differentiating but still very sophisticated IP blocks. Our broad, proven portfolio, ranging from libraries to memories to digital and analog interfaces, responds perfectly to this trend. In Q1, we again saw a strong demand for our cores with USB3.0 and PCI Express leading the way. Memory IP had a good quarter as well with releases of the latest DDR digital controller and analog-Fi, and we received our first order for use in 20-, 22-nanometer designs. ", "In the related systems space, our primary focus is on the intersection of hardware and software design with a powerful prototyping solution. Prototyping is the most efficient way to accelerate embedded software development and system validation. Engineers design with a system-level model of the chip or chips long before the design is completed or manufactured. In practice, this enables software delivery six to nine months earlier. In Q1, our FPGA-based prototyping did pretty particular well as we have evolved the product to better meet high demand. ", "Good progress also was made on the software-based prototyping side, notably opening up new opportunities in automotive and industrial. Mazda, for example, adopted our virtual prototyping solution, enabling them to save significant time and cost in verifying complex systems such as their electronic control units. ", "Moving on to our continued focus on gradually broadening our TAM. The integration of our recent Optical acquisition is progressing well, and the results achieved in Q1 are an excellent start to a good integration into Synopsys. ", "In conclusion, we executed quite well in Q1. We released strong technology, saw good growth, and we see a positive outlook for Q2 and the full year. Overall, we are solidly on track towards our objectives for fiscal '11. ", "With that, let me pass it on to Brian, who will give you the detailed financial perspective.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I'll summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and the financial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Now Synopsys delivered very solid first quarter results meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. Additionally, we achieved solid growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, repurchased $65 million worth of Synopsys shares and exited the quarter with more than $860 million in cash. ", "Total revenue was $365 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago and well within our target range. We delivered revenue growth across all product groups, with particular strength from our IP and systems products. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue. ", "Turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $318 million, which included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets, $15 million of stock-based compensation and $2 million of acquisition-related costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $280 million, an expected year-over-year increase due mainly to our acquisitions but still at the low end of our target range. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter. ", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.31, down $0.88 from a year ago. Recall that Q1 of FY '10 earnings included the onetime impact of a $92 million or $0.61 per share GAAP-only tax benefit, which was associated with the IRS settlement for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 7% to $0.44, exceeding our target range, driven primarily by a lower than expected tax rate and to a lesser extent, higher than expected other income and expense. ", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter, well below our target due to certain onetime tax benefits, driven primarily by the reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit during the quarter for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. The Q1 tax rate includes a onetime benefit of $5 million for fiscal year, FY '10. As a result, we now think that a non-GAAP tax rate for 2011 of between 25% and 26% is a reasonable estimate, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit for FY '10 and '11. ", "Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, while up-front revenue was approximately 7% of total. This is well within our target range of less than 10% up front. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was approximately 2.5 years. ", "As Aart mentioned, we had a number of incremental sales of additional technology in the quarter. These tend to be shorter in duration than the large contract renewals, and we continue to expect average duration over time to be approximately three years. ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $867 million in cash and short-term investments. Of our total cash balance, 33% is onshore and 67% is offshore. As expected, there was an operating cash outflow of $40 million in the quarter. This was due primarily to the timing of payments of annual incentive compensation to our employees related to FY '10 performance. We are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $230 million to $250 million. ", "Now continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $10 million for the quarter. For the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $50 million to $55 million, which includes planned expenditures to increase our computing and network capabilities due in large part to our fiscal 2010 acquisitions. ", "During the quarter, we purchased 2.4 million shares of Synopsys stock for $65 million, and we have approximately $250 million remaining on our current authorization. Fully diluted share count was $153.6 million for the quarter, at the high end of our target range, as a result of higher stock price and increased employee stock option exercises. However, I'd like to reiterate that our current approach is to manage our stock repurchases to keep share count roughly flat at around 151 million shares over time. We expect to increase our buybacks from what we had originally anticipated to help us meet this goal. ", "Continuing on with the balance sheet items. Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $169 million, and DSO was 42 days reflecting a high quality of our AR portfolio. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $602 million, and we ended Q1 with approximately 6,575 employees. This was down from fourth quarter headcount of 6,700 due primarily to the completion of the projects by our transition employees from last year's acquisitions. ", "Now let's address our second quarter and fiscal 2011 guidance. Our GAAP targets exclude any future acquisition-related expenses that may be incurred in Q2 and beyond. So for the second quarter of FY '11, our targets are: revenue between $386 million and $394 million; total GAAP cost and expenses between $319 million and $338 million, which includes approximately $12 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $292 million and $302 million; other income and expense between zero and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 26% and 27%; outstanding shares between $150 million and $155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.31 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.43 to $0.45 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. ", "Now our fiscal 2011 outlook. We reiterate that we expect revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.525 billion; a growth rate of approximately 8.5% to 10.5%; other income and expense between $1 million and $5 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 25% and 26%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 154 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.03 and $1.20, which includes the impact of approximately $52 million in stock-based compensation expense. And at this early point in the year, we're maintaining non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.77. R&D tax credit benefit I discussed earlier will be partially offset by expected higher taxes in other geographies with the remainder of the benefit primarily used to offset higher share count. However, our Q1 overachievement gives us even more confidence in this range. And as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of $230 million to $250 million. ", "Now finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some additional 2011 commentary for expenses and revenue. For the balance of the year, we expect a fairly linear expense profile through Q3 and Q4, while the revenue profile is coming in just slightly lower than what we expect in Q2. For all of FY '11, we expect total non-GAAP cost and expenses to increase generally in line with our targeted revenue growth, give or take a bit. In summary, we're very pleased with our very good first quarter results highlighted by top- and bottom-line growth and continued solid operating margin. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Paul Thomas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "Just in terms of the guidance for Q2 and for full year, I guess, if you sort of take the midpoint of the numbers you laid out, you kind of get flat half-over-half. Could you talk a little about what you expect in  second half and why we wouldn't see any of the momentum from the first half carry over and maybe also, what in particular is going on in Q2 with respect to that, that seems like it might be reversing in the second half?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, let me cover that one. Again, it's fairly early in the year, right? We just completed our first quarter, and we're very happy with better than expected results against all of our key metrics. Q2, with the visibility we already have, as you know, coming in with more than 90% of the quarter's revenues in hand shows a very strong quarter materializing for us. And as we look at the profile ahead for the rest of the year, we just guided in a way that says, \"Look, we've got a good first half up and coming, a good performance.\" We're still in the middle of integrating our acquisitions. It's early in the year. And so again, we just had a good start to both revenue and the EPS targets that we set. So again, expense will fluctuate quarter to quarter, and overall, we're happy to say we're still on track.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "Then maybe with respect to the 2Q expenses, I guess. So 1Q was up from comp expense a little bit, and Q2 revenue was a little bit higher. So are there other expenses that are a little bit higher seasonal in Q2?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. It's just a seasonal -- if you look at our performance from Q1, typically, the accrued expenses are lighter than the rest of the profile for the year and then it picks up to a more normal path. And that's where I was giving a little bit more clarity around expenses to be roughly flat each quarter for the rest of the year. So again, just Q1, it's very typical to be a little bit lighter and then the rest of the year comes through since we do those accruals regularly over the year.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "Just one last one on the license duration. You talked about the shorter duration this quarter, because you had some contracts come back in. Could you talk a little bit about that during the quarter, maybe with respect to the last few? Was that quite a bit more customers coming back in? And sort of any sense for the magnitude of that, that you saw in 1Q versus maybe the second half of last year.", "Aart de Geus", "In general, I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. On average, the license duration is pretty much the same. Q1 tends to be a smaller quarter, and moreover, we alluded to the fact that we had a few deals that were sort of not necessarily renewals but more additions. And they tend to be shorter, because somebody buys something until the end of their contract, or they may buy some additional IP or so. In general, though, we do not see a fundamental change in the business practices for us, and we remain very solidly centered around the three years.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Raj Seth with Cowen Incorporated.", "Simran Brar", "This is Simran Brar calling in for Raj Seth. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, Aart, could you talk a little bit about the progress in your analog offering? And secondly, how are you thinking about core EDA industry growth for the year? And are you seeing any material share shift in your business segments?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. On the outlook side, we have, of course, a fairly broad analog/mixed-signal business. And in that business, we have a strong position in all the verification side. We have a emerging position on the implementation side. In addition, there are interesting connections between that business and the digital tools, as well as the IP. And on all fronts, we're actually making very good progress. I highlighted the fact that on the verification, we had just fielded some very good speed improvements. On the implementation, we have a number of customer adoptions. This is still a very small business, and obviously, we're playing in a field that has been completely dominated by one competitor for many decades, but the solidity of what we have is actually starting to make some marks. And overall, the fact that we have all of these technologies at hand as we develop the most advanced analog/mixed-signal IP is turning out to be a very good value for us. Regarding the growth rates for what we would call sometimes core EDA or traditional EDA, we've told you that what we're banking on is low- to mid-single digit growth, and that appears to be on track so far. It's only our first quarter. We're in the right direction.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Next we'll go to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Aart, sounds like the IP business is doing quite well. Can you give us an update on the system level business, and particularly, how the integration of the various assets there is going and kind of where you see that market?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. And as you probably know, this is a business that is very much aligned with the IP, because fundamentally, it's predicated on the fact that with much, much larger designs, people are both moving up in terms of how they assemble these large designs out of many IT blocks. And as they do that, they get confronted with the reality of there being a lot of software there. And so for those of you not familiar with our path, as much as we have had a few tools, literally, for 20 years at the high end, it is really the last two, three years that we've put a major emphasis on investing both internally and acquiring a number of technologies, all with the objective to provide people an opportunity to model their system or prototype their system, be it in software or in hardware. With the acquisitions of last year, we are in full integration mode right now. And what is exciting is that we've been able to find a good pathway that allows us to both integrate into a new, much more integrated and more powerful version while sustaining and supporting all the existing customers, because the various products we bought also came with a set of customer relationships that are quite broad in terms of the nature. And being able to continue to support them is very valuable, because they are providing us the feedback on where to go with this. So my expectation is that later on in this year, we will be rolling out the first round of integration. There will be multiple rounds. And so far, the customer response is very positive.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Are there any specific products we could look for as that integration rolls out this year?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes and no, but I don't think that we're quite ready to give the specifics, because there are always people that are very worried about, \"Oh, well, is it mine? Is it the other one?\" And the reality is we have found a pathway that actually creates sort of a superset of the best features of each one of the tools. We will give a bit of an update already in March at our next Users Group meeting. But in general, I think you should anticipate hearing more, I would say towards the end of the summer, roughly.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Okay, so not quite that time frame?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, yes, I'm not sure. Frankly, I don't know if we -- I'm sure we'll talk to customers at DAC as well, and all of these things are sort of work in progress. And because we're so much involved with many customers on different fronts on this topic, there's actually a lot to talk about. And I don't know if we, specifically, will roll out a product or not at that time frame. Frankly, that for us is not all that meaningful given that our own conferences are so extremely well attended and in aggregate, attract more people than DAC.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Brian, a couple of questions just clarifying the guidance. Can you clarify your comments about the revenue trajectory in the back half? Are you suggesting that there might be a little sequential downtick from the second quarter as you moved into the 3Q, 4Q?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, that's right. We're showing a very strong increase in our second quarter from our first quarter just looking at the profile of the way the revenue's going to be recognized and then at this point in time, anticipate just a very slight decline into Q3 and Q4 from the second quarter. All of it, again, built into our total year numbers which are between 8.5% and 10.5% revenue growth year-over-year.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "And again, following up on the question from before about sort of the flat EPS, first half and second half. Seems like as you sort of integrate Virage, you should be recovering some of that loss deferred revenue from the purchase accounting, and I would think that would drive some incremental profitability for you in the back half, at least that  say  relates to Virage. Can you just sort of talk us through where -- how you see that happening? I'm assuming it's baked into your guidance but kind of would  have thought it might have drove a little bit more EPS in the back half?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, that's correct. Our deferred revenues, you do take a pretty significant haircut up-front on that, and that was certainly the case with Virage. So typically, you start out -- it's our first full quarter with our Virage financials built into that and then over time, you'd anticipate seeing some of the growth in there. So yes, exclusively in that category of the Virage, it anticipates seeing growth quarter-over-quarter. But then putting that in the context of the $1.5 billion overall top-line revenue growth and where the contracts are specifically outlined, as you know, one of the elements of our business model is having a very high level of visibility, and so elements are going to go up. Some of the elements will get variations based on when cash is due, when the collections are expected to come in. And that's just that slight variation that we're seeing right now.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Maybe just one more question on the revenues in the second half. Typically, there's a bit of seasonality, and your fourth quarter provides a nice little uptick in the revenues. Is that not historically the case? And if it is, what's different this year?", "Aart de Geus", "Tom, I think the seasonality is mostly in our orders. Just because compensation and the workload of much of the sales team tends to want to end at the end of a year, what happens is that in the fourth quarter, a lot of things tend to get closed. For all the renewals, that fundamentally has rarely much impact on revenue. It may have impact on expenses, because the commissions are due for some of these deals, and it may pull in a few things that are sort of add-ons, a la IP or things that were in the works anyway. I think that the last two or three questions seem to be all centered around the fact that, \"Well, are you worried that the second half is worse than the first one.\" No, we're not. I think what we're just saying is that the first quarter and the second quarter happened to be particularly strong. There were also a couple of areas where there was a bit of almost an overhang in demand in prototyping that we're able to execute very quickly on, and many of those tend to be less renewals but more spot sales in the moment. Overall, the business picture is just quite solid for us. And as Brian has said, we have such a good insight in all the renewal deals with their unevenness. Now don't think that the sum of all the deals that we have is an exactly perfectly flat line. The reality is never quite that simple. But it is true that with 80% to 90% in hand entering the year, we do have a substantial amount of insight. And that's why with the particularly strong Q2 guidance, we assume, \"Hey, maybe Q3 and Q4 won't quite be that strong on a continuation,\" But so far, so good.", "Brian Beattie", "And, just early in the year. And with one quarter behind us, we are pleased with the results. And we'll update you again next quarter as Q2 materializes, and we'll have even more visibility in the second half.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And maybe just another question on the operating margin side. Where do you see those trending over the next few years? It seems like if your IP is ramping and the industry fundamentals are getting stronger, we should see an increase in the operating margin line as well, but it seems like we're kind of stuck here between that 23% to 24% range.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, there's a reason why you would come to that conclusion, because we have shifted our main financial objective a little bit. And we have shifted it to say our objective is to grow earnings per share. And as you well know, there are fundamentally only three variables, which is revenue, expenses and share count. And to make it simpler, we are trying to remove the share count out of this altogether by holding it flat with buybacks, notwithstanding that any given quarter may have some fluctuation. And so then you quickly come to the revenue versus expenses balance, and the key for us is to really hit the right balance, because if we see the opportunity to grow the top line a little bit more, we want to do that. And in that sense, we're using our expense money right now, already entirely focused on 2012 and beyond in order to maintain good earnings per share growth. If we see that, for whatever reason, the top- line growth is more difficult, we will immediately revert to a higher pressure on the operating margin so that we stay with our top objective of earnings per share growth.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then just finally, has there been any changes in the legislation, as far as being able to bring your foreign cash back into the U.S.? Any update there?", "Aart de Geus", "Unfortunately, I don't think there's an update. There are sort of waves of debate in Washington, as you may know. And I wouldn't be surprised if this debate will keep coming back as every government in the world right now is looking for money. In that context, it's just completely unpredictable, and therefore, we don't want to count on that. Obviously, having the cash is a good thing, but we don't want to count on being able to repatriate it at this point in time.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Saket Kalia with JPMorgan.", "Saket Kalia - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Saket here for Sterling. Just a couple of questions from our side. So  first, understand the downtick in the second half. But in terms of modeling it, should we be taking that out of the up-front revenue, I guess, part of the top line? Or should it be kind of coming from both  time-based license and up-front and services?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, our average balance, as I said, is to have less than 10% up-front activity. And even with the significant level of new acquisitions last year, we're still well within that range of less than 10%. This quarter came in at 7%. So just relative to modeling, if it was a little bit of each, I think it's just the appropriate way in a generic sense of how to look at the profile going forward.", "Saket Kalia - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then can you give us -- and I know we talked about the technology purchases, the incremental technology purchases in the quarter relative to the renewals, but can you comment at all on the contract renewals in the first quarter in terms of run rates? And maybe any qualitative commentary on what your outlook is for renewals the rest of the year.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, we actually made, I think, a little comment in the preamble saying that the contract renewals that we had were actually quite good in that we were able to increase our run rates. And as you know, while this is somewhat of a fuzzy number, because it's actually extremely complex to calculate and it's not audited, it is still a metric we use in-house to judge the overall quality of our business. And in that context, first quarter was quite good in that regard. Secondly, we said while there were a few additions that were sort of one-off, so to speak, and I think those are all indications that our customers are looking for some additional technology from Synopsys or some additional capacity, and that bodes well. Going forward, we do see a good pipeline of renewal, and so far, all indications are that we're well on track with that.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Aart, you mentioned strong prototyping sales. I was wondering how much of a factor that is in the second quarter bump up in revenue? And is that maybe why the margins aren't quite what we might expect given that big jump in revenue?", "Aart de Geus", "I don't think it is that big. I think it's a healthy, healthy business, but relatively speaking, it's small compared to the overall picture. It's just one of many things that appear to be going well. If there's one thing that I think characterizes, not only Q1 but so far, as we can see, Q2 and as a matter of fact, the whole year, is I think we're executing particularly well on many strategies that are actually coming together. And many people realized that last year, we've made many acquisitions. We put many things in movement. We're in full integration of all of this. This is actually a substantial multiyear task, and things are coming together. We're fixing issues and making things better, more efficient, and the response from the customer base on all of those is actually quite positive. But that response has to be earned with every new product and with every new way of doing business. And so it's almost more that many pieces feel like they're coming together very nicely and that we're executing just quite well.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the conference back over to our host and presenters.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we appreciate your attending today. Obviously, this was a quarter that was strong and had a good outlook. And that's probably the reason why the call is also fairly short, and so all the more we appreciate your questions and attending. And as usual, Brian and myself will be available a little bit later this afternoon for any follow-ups. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today.

Davidson & Co.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. ", "At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Beth. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2011, and in our earnings release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, as well as the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our first quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong second quarter, keeping us well on track towards meeting our objectives for the year. Against the backdrop of a healthy electronics and semiconductor market, Synopsys is well-positioned as yet another wave of eagerly awaited electronic products and advanced technologies are heading to market. Our strength is supported by our clear industry leadership position, our unwavering commitment to state-of-the-art technology and support in traditional EDA and our continued drive towards high-growth adjacencies such as IP. ", "Financially, in the quarter, we delivered revenue of $394 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45. Supported by strong orders in the quarter, the run rate of the business grew and the outlook for the second half is solid. Looking forward, we are best well on track towards our earnings per share objective for the year. ", "Before commenting on our products, let me give some color on the customer landscape. Overall, the electronics industry remains healthy, and demand for new product is high. After an extremely strong 2010 recovery year, the outlook for semiconductors is solid with expectations of upper-single-digit growth this year. Simultaneously, that very recovery in worldwide economic stability are bringing challenges to our customers. First, time-to-market pressure is back. With the rapid growth in the mobile and consumer markets, the race is on to deliver complex products, often using the most advanced technologies. Notably, we are seeing accelerated adoption of the 28/32 and even the 20/22 nanometer nodes. Thanks to our investments and relationships, Synopsys is well-placed to effectively serve these customers. ", "Second, the features of these new end products are taxing every aspect of electronic design, ranging from the integration of hardware and software, to the reuse of sophisticated IP blocks, to the detailed physics impacting power consumption and manufacturing yield. The interaction of these effects is precisely one of the driving reasons for customers to select Synopsys as a key partner. ", "And third, with the economic recovery, the employment market has become more competitive as well. And while business is strong, many customers are very focused on how to improve their productivity to make up for increasing compensation costs. ", "These challenges and opportunities have recently led to several notable consolidations in the semiconductor industry, which we believe will continue to be a trend in the foreseeable future. ", "Looking at our products, we see continued strong interest in the rapid adoption of leading-edge solutions. This was quite visible at our users group meeting in March. We had record attendance, with over 2,300 attendees from more than 200 companies. Not surprisingly, popular themes were the ongoing quest for faster turnaround time in every aspect of the design flow and the never-ending push for performance while reducing powerful mobility in battery-operated devices. There was also particularly strong interest in our sessions on reusable IP, which incidentally, registered the highest rating in the history of the conference. ", "Let me focus for a moment on our implementation tools. At the conference, we introduced DC Explorer, a breakthrough in logic design that enables much faster chip completion. It's great benefit is that it correlates well with the downstream physical implementation and allows engineers to find and correct issues much earlier. ", "We're also seeing strong momentum with our In-Design physical verification solution, IC Validator. This quarter, 2 Top 20 semiconductor companies have started to standardize on Synopsys through final signoff, thus no longer needing a separate physical verification tool. ", "Moving to functional verification. We delivered outstanding results and speed improvements to drive a number of competitive wins, including an important displacement at a leading communications IT company for use in its high-profile, next-generation chip. ", "In analog implementation, we see continued momentum with Custom Designer. Tapeouts are growing nicely, including one of the Top 20 established companies recently completing a 40-nanometer high-performance analog design. A number of top semiconductor companies are benchmarking our solution with increasingly positive results as they are exploring the adoption of Customer Designer in their flows. ", "Finally, in manufacturing, another major customer is deploying Yield Explorer companywide. The value proposition is compelling. Yield Explorer offers large gains, as even a small change in yield dramatically improves their bottom line. ", "Now let me turn to our high-growth adjacencies, which continued to see strong results. The IP and systems areas is expected to represent about 20% of our revenue in 2011, a scale that is meaningful in driving overall revenue growth. ", "First, to IP. There are many building blocks on a chip: Processors, graphics cores, connections to external elements such as cameras, microphones, data interfaces, many types of memory, analog blocks, and so on. Historically, companies designed these internally. But outsourcing of reusable elements is accelerating, driven by a combination of customer desire to focus limited resources on differentiating projects and the availability of very sophisticated, reliable third-party IP. ", "Synopsys offers a broad portfolio of IP mapped into the key manufacturing processes. After 15-plus years of investment and execution, we are the second largest IP company in the world, and our portfolio includes a rich collection of key building blocks. ", "Starting with interface IP. We supply all of the top interface blocks including USB, PCI Express, HDMI, et cetera, and are either #1 or #2 in each. ", "Moving to memory IP. We find that about 50% of the modern chip area can be memory. As the #1 provider of memory IP, we can have dramatic footprint on advanced design. ", "Finally, looking at analog IP. We see many applications that require digital to analog, and vice versa, translation. An example of this would be connecting to an external microphone. We're also #1 in this rather fragmented market segment. ", "In Q2, we continued to see very strong demand for our IP products. This was particularly true in vertical markets such as mobile multimedia, smart phones, tablets, cameras, digital home, including set-top boxes in digital TV and wireless infrastructure. ", "This increasing demand has a twofold impact on our business. First, customers are significantly more willing to outsource as they see the time-to-market advantages of a commercial IP reuse approach to design. We see many opportunities to leverage our past investment and grow our business. Second, with the demand for additional title, the process-specific porting and the increased complexity of many IP cores, we need to continue to invest to meet demand and drive future revenue growth. ", "Now turning to the systems space, where our primary focus is to enable customers to handle the increasing challenges of hardware-software interaction. Central to this is our portfolio of prototyping solutions, featuring both software models and FPGA-based prototypes. ", "Prototyping accelerates both embedded software development and system validation by using models of the chip long before the design is actually finished. This approach can accelerate software delivery by 6 to 9 months. Traditionally, customers have built prototypes internally, but here too, increased complexity and sophisticated commercial solutions are attractive for outsourcing. For example, a major communications IC company is now ramping up its use of our virtual prototypes and has already started to provide the models to its end customers to help them accelerate their software development. ", "Also, during the quarter, a top global imaging company expanded its use on a broad range of our system solutions, including prototyping and high-level design. Overall, our FPGA-based rapid prototyping solution, again saw good growth. ", "To conclude, we executed very well in Q2. Our technology pipeline delivery and adoption remained strong, especially as we focus on advanced technology. As a result, we are well on track to meeting our financial objectives for the year. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q3 and the full year. ", "As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We've provided reconciliations in the press release and our financial supplements posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. ", "Synopsys delivered a strong quarter, meeting or exceeding virtually all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in February. Q2 financial results were highlighted by strong orders, solid growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable operating cash flow generation. ", "Additionally, we repurchased $170 million worth of Synopsys stock during the quarter. Total revenue was $394 million, an increase of 16% and at the high end of our target range. We delivered revenue growth across all product groups, with particular strength from our IP and systems products. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue. ", "Turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $342 million, which included $19 million of amortization of intangible assets and $13 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses of $307 million were slightly above our target range, and as expected, increased year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase was due mainly to our acquisitions, while the sequential increase was driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses, such as the variable compensation impact that resulted from strong orders in Q2 and the first half of the year. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin was 22% for the quarter and 23% for the first half of fiscal 2011. ", "For the full year, we expect expenses to be slightly higher than originally anticipated, as we address near-term cost pressures, such as employee compensation. However, we have increased confidence in our annual EPS guidance and in fact, are raising the lower end of the range. ", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.53, substantially above our target range, and up from $0.26 a year ago. This was due primarily to the onetime impact of a $32.8 million, or $0.21 per share, GAAP-only tax benefit associated with an IRS settlement for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.45, an increase of 10%, driven by solid top line growth and a lower effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter, well below our target range, driven primarily by a more favorable U.S. tax rate expected for the year because of the items settled in the 2006 through '09 IRS audit. As a result, we now think that a non-GAAP tax rate for FY '11 of between 24% and 25% is a reasonable estimate. ", "Upfront revenue was 6% of total, well within our target range of less than 10% up front. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was 2.8 years. We continue to expect average duration over time to be approximately 3 years. ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remained strong with $840 million in cash and short-term investments. Of our total cash balance, 27% is onshore and 73% is offshore. We generated $96 million in cash from operations in the quarter, and we are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to approximately $300 million, up from our prior range of $230 million to $250 million, to reflect increased collections driven primarily by timing of deals. ", "Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $10 million for the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect capital spending of approximately $50 million to $55 million. ", "During the quarter, we purchased 6.2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $170 million, delivering on our commitment to increase our buybacks to help us meet our current goal of keeping share count roughly flat at about 151 million shares over time. During the first half of the fiscal year, we spent $235 million, repurchasing 8.6 million shares. And we have $80 million remaining in our current authorization. ", "Continuing on with our balance sheet items. Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $210 million, and DSO was 49 days, which is within our target range. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $626 million. And we ended Q2 with approximately 6,540 employees. ", "Now let's address our third quarter and fiscal 2011 guidance. Our GAAP targets exclude any future acquisition-related expenses that may be incurred in Q3 and beyond. For the third quarter of FY '11, our targets are: Revenue between $378 million and $386 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $319 million and $337 million, which includes approximately $13 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $292 million and $302 million, down from Q2; other income and expense between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 24% and 25%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 153 million; GAAP earnings of $0.25 to $0.31 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.41 to $0.43 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. ", "Now our fiscal 2011 outlook: We reiterate that we expect revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.525 billion; a growth rate of approximately 8.5% to 10.5%; other income and expense between $1 million and $5 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of between 24% and 25%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 153 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.33 and $1.46, which includes the impact of approximately $56 million in stock-based compensation expense and the IRS settlement of $32.8 million; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.77. We've increased the low end of our guidance range by $0.03. And as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million. ", "In summary, we continue to execute well in Q2, highlighted by top and bottom line growth and very solid cash flow generation. So with that, turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Brian, just a couple of quick ones for you. Can you talk about what happened in sales and marketing? You had a $20 million sequential bump. I don't think I've seen that before. A little unusual. Can you explain that? And then just a clarification on the tax comment. I thought you guided the whole year at 24% to 25%. The first half was, as I recall, closer to 21%. You guided the third quarter to 24% to 25%, I think. Does Q4 go up, or did I sort of misread what you were trying to say about the full year?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, you bet, Raj. Okay, on the first question, the sales and marketing expense. That effect, it reflects the total expense increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2. It's primarily in that sales and marketing line. And it's all about commissions. As you know, we take a proportional expense accrual on the total bookings levels that go throughout the year, and we're just indicating Q2 has a very, very strong quarterly bookings number for it. So therefore, it takes into account the very significant amount of bookings that came in on the quarter, reflects commissions and, to some extent, some of the variable compensation, on top of that, for the rest. The second question about the tax rate. You're right. When we look at our total year, our guidance is 24% to 25%. And what we reflect in there is both Q1, where the rate came in at 21% -- and as you know, that reflected the approval through the government of the R&D tax credit, and that had about a $5 million impact in Q1 and took us to 21%. In the second quarter, we're at 21% as well, which reflected the impact in 2011 of the audit that was just completed by the IRS for our years -- '06 through '09. And clearly, it made it very clear for us on how we treat certain actions in '11. We're able to flow that through and make all of the year-to-date adjustments totally accurate. So those are again, the onetime impacts you factor into your year. And then, on the year at this point, 24% to 25% does reflect some increase in the higher rates in Q3 and Q4 to reflect the onetime events happened in the first half. And we're still working through on the tax rate to optimize that overall.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So just so I'm clear. Given your guidance, what would you expect in Q4? What should we assume the tax rate to be in Q4? Because by implication, if the whole year's 24% to 25%, the first half is much lower. Q3 is in line, that suggests Q4 is higher. Am I -- is that correct?", "Brian Beattie", "It's going to be in the range of about 25%, 26% even for the year as we get through all the onetime costs in the first half.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And if I might, just a question or 2 to Aart on the IP business. Aart, you -- this has obviously been a real area of growth for you, standout area of growth. We showed a big sequential uptick, I believe, with that IP -- no, it wasn't, actually, forgive me. I was going to say you saw a big sequential increase in that, but it was actually a verification. So forgive me on that. Can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about service, some porting costs, et cetera. What are -- within your broad portfolio, what is it that's really hot right now and driving growth? Or is it more bundled sales that are driving growth in IP? And sort of where is the attention from customers focused today?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, I think top-down, we see a little bit of growth everywhere in the company, but IP clearly stands out. And if you look at what's happening there, is that there are a lot of customers that are now using very large blocks in order to get very quickly to market, a. And so it's interesting that there are a number of customers for example, in the Far East that almost start from scratch, and very quickly have sophisticated chips. This is in contrast to existing companies that have been doing their IP for many years themselves, where the trend towards outsourcing is a natural outcome from 2 things, I believe. One is that, there's a desire to just be more productive and more cost efficient, and designing your own stuff doesn't do that. But the second, thing is that -- and many of these IP blocks, themselves, are becoming very sophisticated, and not every company has the skill set in-house. And so the result for us is that there's been a very high demand across the board for many blocks, from very small to very complex ones, with many requests for porting to an enhanced set of technologies, because simultaneously in the background, there's acceleration towards the smaller geometries. And so we're supporting, actually, a quite broad spectrum of silicon technologies with a very broad spectrum of IP blocks.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And Aart, how do you think about the associated service opportunity? Because beyond porting, I would imagine many of your customers would love it if -- and there are third-party service providers of course. But how do you think about where and how Synopsys should play on the associated, somewhat broader than porting, but service, I would think, opportunity? Is there any change there in your strategy?", "Aart de Geus", "There's no explicit change in strategy. I think the thing -- the term \"think about it\" is the right word because the challenge with service is always the same. The people that are really interested in top-notch services are also interested in top-notch talents to do that. That tends to be very expensive and not always easy to provide, and therefore the cost equation is hard to completely justify in the business model. And so we're comfortably rethinking that because with the IP, certainly there's an opportunity to be closer to a number of these customers. And we are actually doing some very sophisticated implementations with customers of subsystems, including supporting their processor work and the blocks we provide around that. And so there's an opportunity space there. The financial equation has not been all that simple, so I don't want to jump to any conclusions yet.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Right. If I might, one last question, a little bit different topic area. Apple gets a lot of attention for deciding to take in-house app processors and do their own A4, A5. I'm curious, do you think, given what you see in the market, that any other large company might choose to do something similar, where they can get a cost-based flow, do their own design, pay a boundary margin but avoid maybe some of the margin that's going to some of the semiconductor suppliers today? Do think that will become a trend, or is it to your earlier point, that it's very hard, even with IP-based designs, to do some of those. Is that more of a one-off particular to Apple, in your view?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, just to make clear before I answer, we never comment about any specific actions that one of our customers may take. But in general, what you're describing, we have actually seen at a few customers that are seeing the benefit of being very well -- working directly with us on their most advanced designs, because, by the time you optimize a processor primarily for speed and power and the blocks around that, you're talking about very sophisticated designs. If you add to that, which is a given in that field, that you want to be on the most advanced silicon technologies, you're adding a whole set of other dimensions where the EDA provider, and in this case, you could say also service provider, which we are in these situations, has to have very good connections to the silicon technology. And so this becomes very much a team sport where everybody has to rely on the few partners they work with. And so yes, we have seen some of the large companies that have a very high return on investment by shining in that dimension, that they are bringing in more of design in-house and both for competitive reasons, I have to be, of course, extremely careful with the information. But also for competitive reasons, very aggressively driving the future.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So just to kick off, I want to follow up on the variable expense. Brian, can you quantify for us relative to the guidance that you gave for the quarter, how much over did the variable expense portion come relative to that guidance?", "Brian Beattie", "Again, we achieved that high end of our target. Our revenue is just slightly up and our expenses are just slightly up to that basis.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right. But if you look at that midpoint of range, are we talking about the variable expense was $5 million or $10 million higher than what you thought going into the quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, I'm not going to quantify on that. Be relative to the amount of accruals we made on that commission shifting. But when you looked at where our guidance was, we came in slightly above that. And just think about that as the timing on the commissions for the total year basis just got put into the quarter. Our guidance into Q3 reflects that our expenses are coming down as we'd anticipate that profiling changes into Q3.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Yes. I got you. Aart, in terms of the contract duration has continued to come down here. I think it's probably in a healthy way because you're still talking about strong order levels. Is it that you're seeing more of the products being bought, or more licenses of the existing products? In other words, what is driving the healthiness in that demand on the order front?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, we are not yet on the conclusion that the duration is coming down. I think there's always a fair degree of variability from one quarter to another. But in general, I think our business, we still consider essentially a 3-year business, certainly for the core EDA tools and everything that's sort of in that ilk. Regarding other parts of the business, there, you have a little bit different business model because the IP is not in quite the same vein, and so you can see spikes up and down. And that would, on average, bring the durations down. But fundamentally, I don't think we see a big change in our business model.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I'd be remiss not to ask if you had comments in terms of Japan?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, obviously, we have seen with stupor the events that happened there, like everybody else. It was interesting to see how, in some areas, specifically, semiconductor technology, the diagnostics were very, very fast in finding out where the real shortcomings were. And it appears that, from what we see, the customers that are hurt are people that are either directly affected in their business, so where their factories have been hit, or that are systems companies that need a variety of almost mechanical parts, and automotive is very obvious in that. In the semiconductor field, after, I would say, about 8 to 12 weeks, the number of commentaries about this went way down, and the expectations is that in about 2 quarters total, this is less visible for the semiconductor industry because alternatives have been found. Now having said that, obviously, a number of Japanese companies are working very hard on reestablishing their business flow. And we are doing the best we can. Initially, mostly by helping them work during the power outages, because many of the software programs run much longer than the 8 or 10 hours that they have. But today, I don't see that there's much impact on our behavior. There has certainly not been any impact on our business.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And last question. You mentioned just over 10% revenue customer. Were there any 10% bookings customers?", "Aart de Geus", "We never disclose individual bookings. But your revenue performance is still correct.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Paul Thomas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "I guess on the last call, you did talk about 3Q revenue being down slightly and 4Q being down slightly. And obviously, the guidance still implies that for the full year. I just want to understand, was the first half of '11, it was mostly IP and systems prototyping revenue, and that's not expected to follow through in the second half of the year? I guess the in-market drivers you talk about, tablets and mobility, I mean, obviously those things are still in place. So what is it in the second half of the year that's sort of not following through from the first half?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, just to clarify some of the positions on that. As you look for the first half and the second half, we're still projecting an increase in revenues in the second half, compared to the first half. And just as we identified last quarter, that our second quarter, based on a very high level of visibility we have to all of the contract terms, conditions and project deliverables, they were really scheduled to come in into the second quarter. And they did exactly do what we had forecast. If you wanted to break down, even sequentially from Q1 to Q2, about 2/3 of the increase in the revenues came into the IP and systems group. And clearly, that reflects about a 24% overall sequential growth in IP and systems. So very strong. But even as you look at that, each one of those are specific contracts that reflect on percentage completion in terms of revenue models and specific deliverables that are completed by the engineering teams and delivered in the second quarter. So we had that level of visibility. The other 1/3 of the growth sequentially was in our core business. And it really just reflects the visibility we had to the specific contracts, of when they mature, when they deliver, and when new ones start up, if you like. So that kind of takes you from Q2 to Q3. And then in -- excuse me, Q1 to Q2. And then in Q3, just a very slight decline that we're projecting at this point, just because of the visibility. Very strong growth we have in the customer deliverables in Q2, and still well on track for our total year commitment. And it's all just very normal fluctuations in the contract terms, conditions as we move forward, as we assimilate a number of the acquisitions we had last year and reflect all of that in our business model moving forward.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "Okay. Fair enough. That's very helpful. I guess you comment on core too, obviously, being up. That was 1/3 of the growth. But with respect to, I think what Aart said, about high single or I guess, mid to high single-digit, the core EDA growth for the year, sort of your market expectation, that also looks like there's going to be some acceleration expected from that segment in the back half of the year. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Brian Beattie", "No. I'd say to clarify, on the core business, we are a very good quarter, as we said, reflected in the numbers. On a year-over-year basis, we're up 3.9%. And our indications around the core business is in that low to mid single-digit growth rates for the core business, and then the double-digit growth rate on our IP and systems business.", "Paul Thomas - Roth Capital Partners LLC", "Okay. Very helpful. Then let's see, maybe the last one. On the duration. So you talked about the 2.8 but still having the expectation for a 3-year average duration. Last quarter, you had some of that because guys were coming back mid-contract to redesign. Was any of that happening in this quarter to bring that to the low end? Or was that mostly natural renewals?", "Aart de Geus", "A little bit of both, mostly natural renewals. We have a number of products that people are interested in. And so it feels to me a little bit like businesses is back to business as usual before the whole downturn. And in that situation, no contract gets renewed the last day of the contract for a couple of reasons. A, because neither party ever wants to be in a situation where the other party feels that they're being held hostage. But more importantly, because very often, there are new products, there are new capabilities or there are increases in utilization that people want to have. And invariably, our sales team will then take the existing contract and then essentially amend it or scratch it and renew it for the next 3 years or so. And so it feels very much to me like we're into a normal business season.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Just a couple of industry questions for you today. If you look at the several large semiconductor guys, they're talking about increasing the R&D spending by about 10% this year. And I was wondering, in your mind, how close is the linkage today to -- from R&D spending to EDA spending? And how does that translate? Is it a couple of quarter delay before you start seeing the extra spending? And how does that spending materialize at your place?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in many ways, this question should have touched directly to the previous one, which is the duration, because as R&D spending jumps up or jumps down, we are much more mitigated because it tends to end up in 3-year agreements. Now the fact that R&D goes up, I think there's no question it's good news. And it ties directly to one of the things that I expressed in my opening commentary, which is that the pressure for time-to-market is on, but it also expresses the fact that a number of our customers are seeing increased emphasis on all the software that's attached to the designs that they're doing. In other words, things are more complex and are under more time pressure. And those are all good things for our industry because that's precisely the core skills that we bring to the party. And our job is to make sure that we have products that they can pick up. In that context, I wouldn't be surprised if we also saw a continuation of growth of the IP reuse business, because that's actually one of the cornerstones to get to market more quickly.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. I was just kind of curious, when you're in the middle of, say, a 3-year contract in the second year of it, and your customers raise their R&D, do you see much pickup in the EDA spend? Or is it for other things, like the IP, that you see?", "Aart de Geus", "Sometimes. I think whenever a customer has more budget, as you can imagine, their general managers immediately have 10 ways to spend it. And we want to be as close as possible to those people at that time. At the same time, there's also a certain steadiness to what we do and what they do, because -- just because they increase their budget doesn't mean that tomorrow, they have 10% more engineers or do 10% more chips. I think the correlation is not one-to-one right there in that minute. But in aggregate, there is certainly a linkage between the 2, and this bodes well for us.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yes, okay. And then maybe, have you ever quantified the market opportunity going from, say, the 32-nanometer node down to the 22-nanometer node for EDA?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, this is a question that literally comes back every node. And there's always 2 perspectives, one is the perspective that with every node, people will buy dramatically different tools. And that perspective is just not quite correct. And the reason is that much of the design that's done is being tuned for the next node and actually is predicated on being successful with the previous one, otherwise the degree of difficulty is just astronomical. On the other side of the spectrum though, is the fact that with the new node, and we can it see it very clearly for 28 and now for 20, there are a number of new technical challenges that are actually very difficult to meet. And one of the -- the reason we are particularly bullish on the offerings that we have is because I think Synopsys has an enormous degree of competence, both in its technology and its support and services in these advanced nodes. And not surprisingly, we are involved in virtually every most advanced chip in the world, to help them move there. And so as much as we simultaneously would like to increase our billing to them, the first objective, of course, is to be the chosen partner in that move forward. And I think very often, we are.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. So when you go from one node to the next, you think your opportunities may be better from a market share point of view, market gaining that it is from a market growth point of view?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. I think you captured exactly the essence. And we certainly think that we have very high market share in the advanced nodes.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then just finally, any update on the pricing environment? With the improved market, has price become less of a tool for your more aggressive competitors?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the reality is it's always a very competitive market. I do believe that with some of the competitors doing maybe a little bit better than a few years ago, there's only the opportunity for focusing a little bit more on the value delivered than focusing on the price. And for the earlier comment of R&D budgets going up, we should aim our pricing at those R&D budgets. Now having said that, it's a very competitive field with a very rapidly changing set of technologies. And so that will never go away. But I don't feel that the pricing has become -- has changed substantially towards the negative, no.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. I appreciate your insights.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, we go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer [ph] from Griffin Securities.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "A question about your IP growth and profitability, a bit of a follow-on to Roger's earlier question. Historically, the IP business has been much less profitable than the tools business, though in your case, I'm sure you've seen improvements in profitability as it's grown. Could you talk about from here, how you think about the margin leverage in the IP business as you continue to see the kind of growth that you have been experiencing? Could you reach your fiscal '11 or fiscal '12 earnings objectives if, for instance, because of the investments you need to make in scaling the IP business, you see little or no margin improvement in that business for the time being?", "Aart de Geus", "Excellent question, because it is a topic of constant discussion here as to how to balance of these things right. There's no question that the IP business has growth opportunities. There's also no question that we'll need to make investments to build new titles, port to more silicon technologies. And the -- obviously, the investment comes before the revenue. And so in that context, we are focusing on gradually improving the margin in that business, but we're also very much interested in growing the business itself because that opportunity is there. And every year, we visit those questions. And as a matter of fact, during the year, multiple times. But for a given year, we set ourselves a number of objectives. And so in aggregate, just to make clear what we said earlier, we are very much on track for the company to meet the earnings objectives we have set for this fiscal year. As we go forward, we will revisit that exact question because, simply put -- and you will understand this better than we do, it is all about, how do we grow the value of the company? And that is obviously a balance between the profitability versus the growth rate. And this is an example where we have opportunities in both dimensions. So balance will be the key. But so far, I think we're doing very well because we're improving both.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Second question is with respect to geographic results, specifically in Asia-Pacific, which is now, at least in the first half of the year, solidly your second-largest region and has been showing some very good year-over-year growth, including Q2. The question is do think that you can sustain that kind of disproportionate growth in Asia Pac? And can you talk about the investments that might need to be made in order for that to happen? And is it fair to assume that there's a strong correlation between the Asia Pac growth as a region and your IP business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, first, I think we are in a very good situation to continue to do well in Asia Pac for a number of reasons. One, we have established now for many years a stellar team in multiple countries. And when we talk about Asia Pac, obviously, many people immediately focus on China, as being so visible on the world stage. But clearly, there are other countries, such as Taiwan and Korea, that are major participants in the semiconductor market, and to a lesser degree, India and Singapore and a few others. And so it's actually a very broad region that all has its own needs and its own behaviors. And the good news is I think we have very high-quality teams in each region that are well-connected. So from the perspective, will we be able to continue to support and participate in the regional growth? The answer should be a resounding \"yes\". From the perspective of, is there a big difference in the business types? Well, a little bit in China. I would say, partially because there's much less history than in the other country, but there's also an extremely, extremely rapid learning ramp, partially helped by people that have learned in the West, partially by the fact that the governments have been very proactive in the semiconductor and high-tech segment. And in that context, there are a number of companies that are essentially joining -- jumping, sorry, straight to system-on-a-chip design using losing large blocks, using advanced tools, and not being encumbered by any not-invented-here flows from the path. At the same time though, a number of multinationals are in these countries as well, and are taking advantage of the entrepreneurial and rapid movement. So bottom line is I think we're in a good position from both perspectives, and yes, I do think that we will continue to see, relatively speaking, good growth in that area of the world.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. Just a couple of last ones for Brian. Your service and maintenance revenues, at $49 million, had an unusually large sequential and year-over-year increase. I think this was your best quarter in that category since the fourth quarter of '05. The question there is, is that partly a function of perhaps the waterfall effect of previous bookings flowing now into maintenance recognition? Or was it, in part, tied to the previously mentioned services related to IP?", "Brian Beattie", "It's the latter part, Jay. The growth in our business now -- almost a $200 million run rate in overall services. Most significant part of the growth is coming from our business units, themselves. And in particular, as I was saying, about half of the growth in the whole systems and IP area is in the services piece itself. So this reflects a number of the acquisitions that we made recently that have a more significant percentage completion model of revenue recognition. So we'll sign up to a project, and as the project is completed, we make the milestones committed to in the contract and we take the revenue. So all of the growth you're seeing there is coming primarily from our services group and some other slight growth from the other business units that's coming through. So that's just reflecting the new businesses we've got and a larger amount of services work that goes along with the new businesses. And I think that's going to continue to grow.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then lastly, on the duration question. I understand what you're saying that the recent shortening is not necessarily a structural thing or permanent thing. So the question is, even with an expectation of an average of 3 years, would you foresee doing, or customers asking for, 4-year and 5-year deals? And would you be willing to do those, assuming the run rates were no worse than what you had before?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we never comment specifically on our business practices. I would say that in general, the ranges tend to be very uniform for most customers. There are always some exception, and the exception needs to be really justified, why it makes sense either strategically or economically. But in general, I think our business model is relatively uniform.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Aart, could you just take a minute and discuss whether or not you think there's any opportunity for sort of software to serve as application service provider type model in EDA? And if so, if you guys at Synopsys are doing anything in that domain?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, software as a service. There are many, many different forms of that. I can tell you only what we have done or are doing. We recently introduced to some of our customers, a cloud computing capability that is aimed specifically at the simulation field and aimed specifically at the need for some customers to have some peak availability of simulation. And the challenge for a number of customers is they may be late on a project, they see, maybe, an opportunity to go faster to market or so, and lo and behold, suddenly they need 2,000 computers for 2 weeks. Well, many customers cannot either afford it or are just limited by their computer environment, by the facilities, by the process to buy these, et cetera, et cetera. And so the -- what we have available is the capability that, for which we have teamed up with Amazon, to make it possible for customers to literally, on very short notice, have available, let's say, 2,000 computers with our VCS simulator. We charge a price per hour for the customer. And that's, of course, a function of the number of hours that they're willing to commit. Of course, we pay Amazon for the privilege of using their computers. And as part of the business model, the price is not discountable by our field force because that is very important in these type of business models. And we're now looking at is this of interest to customers. We have already navigated through many of the technical issues on how to make this practical, to many of the legal issues on how to make sure that the security is there, to some of the service issues in terms of how can you quickly make it work. But the business model has to still be proven, and this is early. So essentially, literally, just mentioned it to our customers in our users group meeting. And I think the next 12 months will tell if there is some life in that business model.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Right. I appreciate that. That was what I was...", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to our host and presenters for any closing comments.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we appreciate the time you just spent with us. Hopefully, you heard that we finished with a very strong and solid quarter Q2 with an excellent outlook towards the end of the year. And as usual, Brian I will take some of your questions after the call. Have a good rest of the day. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. On the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "During the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual result to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2011, and in our earnings release for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 issued earlier today.", "In addition, all financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and supplemental financial information, can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our third quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that we had an excellent Q3. Combined with strong results in the first half and a solid outlook for Q4, we're confident that we will exit fiscal 2011 with a great deal of strength. Financially, in the quarter, we delivered revenue of $387 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46. Our orders for the year have been strong and the run rate of the business grew nicely this quarter. We are increasing our revenue, EPS and cash flow guidance for the year, and expect to deliver double-digit growth for both top and bottom line. ", "Now before commenting on our products and results, let me give you some color on the customer landscape. Notwithstanding the global economic worries and the high volatility in the stock market, design activity continues unabated in pursuit of 3 markets: Mobile devices, the cloud infrastructure and smart everything. In the mobile market, semiconductor companies are grappling with the technical challenge of increasing speed without increasing power. These highly competitive customers are racing to meet market windows, while, of course, also aiming at the lowest possible production costs. ", "The cloud is a system of massive data centers running very high-performance servers, offloading compute and storage-intensive tap for the portable devices. The technical need here is symmetric: decrease power while delivering the highest possible performance. The rest of the electronics industry, be it in the automotive, industrial or consumer segment, is seeing significant growth in silicon content through an explosion of embedded smart everything chip. ", "To give a sense of proportion, of the top 50 electronic design software spenders in the world, 36 are mobile providers and 9 are providers of cloud hardware. We are the largest supplier in almost every case. In Asia Pacific, which dominates in the development of consumer devices, we are strong as well, with on top of our Tools business already 60% of the leading semiconductor companies embedding our IP blocks. So regardless where the market goes over the next few months, we expect Synopsys to be in a cornerstone position. We have a compelling combination of global scale, complete solutions, product excellence and outstanding support. Our financial strength allows us to continually invest in technology and help our customers safely streamline the number of vendors. This makes us an ideal partner in any phase of the business cycle. ", "So how are we impacting the mobile cloud and smart-everything markets? The customers' challenges are easily summarized in 3 words: better, sooner, cheaper. Better means more compute performance and less power utilization. Sooner means higher design productivity and scheduled predictability. Cheaper means best silicon utilization with highest yields. While easy to state, delivering on these expectations demands advanced silicon technology, state-of-the-art integrated tools and flows and very sophisticated IP. ", "Let me highlight what progress was made in a number of areas in this past quarter. Our core solutions are doing very well in terms of business level, technology advances and customer adoption. For example, for the mobile market, achieving a lower power consumption implies continually migrating to smaller geometries. Synopsys has a well-earned reputation for being the key enabler of the most advanced designs. This quarter, both STMicroelectronics and Samsung taped out their first 20-nanometer test chips with our Galaxy implementation flow. To achieve this, we collaborated with foundry partners and customers to support these very complex geometries. ", "During the quarter, we also announced widespread support for TSMC's 28-nanometer reference flow from system-level to chip design to verification to yield improvement. Of particular note is the exclusion of our physical verifier, IC Validator. This product is experiencing rapid adoption as its integration in the design flow removes the need for a separate physical verification tool. Custom Designer, our analog design solution, continues to progress. We are systematically removing the barriers to entry put up by incumbent tools and the tape-out count of our customers is growing. This includes a recently taped completed designed by Moortec Semiconductor, a company specializing in high-performance analog IP for medical, consumer wireless, audio and automotive markets. We also displayed some major competitor at a company using mobile apps to enable personalized medical therapy. ", "Confirming the completeness of our solution, Custom Designer is now included in TSMC's 28-nanometer analog mixed signal reference flow. ", "Moving on to verification as the single biggest challenge in productivity, we saw excellent progress this quarter throughout our portfolio. In digital, we are the primary solution and the strongest player for leading customers in both mobile and cloud due to our continued technology strength. ", "Our newest low-power release, for example, just became 2X faster while using half the memory, is very significant enhancements. In analog simulation, we served 19 of the top 20 chip companies and are driving significant technology advances, including excellent speed improvement with our FastSPICE solutions. At the systems level, our prototyping products are aimed at modeling the interaction of hardware and software. In essence, virtual prototyping allows software designers to develop their software on a model of the hardware before the hardware exists. ", "Synopsys leads in this emerging area. In Q3, we shipped a brand-new product, Virtualizer, which is the integration of the 3 previous generation virtual prototyping solutions that we had acquired in recent years. Virtualizer unites the best features of each system while providing a platform that unifies our offering. Customer reaction is very positive and we expect a fairly rapid migration to the new solution. ", "As the design gets more refined, one can also build a prototype of programmable FPGAs. Here, too, we have the leading position and our FPGA prototyping did very well again this quarter. Renesas Electronics, for example, adopted our solution, demonstrating considerable time-saving and high-quality results over their previous environment. One more activity common to all the advanced mobile, cloud and smart-everything customers is that IP reuse continues to be an outstanding productivity booster. ", "Indeed, more and more customers are collaborating with us as they increasingly outsource sophisticated building blocks to accelerate their time-to-market and save costs in the process. ", "Over the last 15 years, we have systematically built a large portfolio of high-quality IP blocks, which together with systems, represent about 20% of our revenue. IP is the highest area of growth for us this year. We estimate that only about 25% of IP is currently outsourced. Today, next to ARM, which focuses primarily on embedded processors, we are the second largest IP supplier and the leading provider of standards based interface, analog and memory IP. All these are in great demand for the mobile markets and represent a TAM of approximately $600 million. ", "During the quarter, Synopsys and ARM, an important long-term ecosystem partner, also jointly announced, as part of our ongoing relationship, a multi-year collaboration, tools deal and IP access agreement. Since we assist virtually all of the design groups in the world that develop the most advanced mobile systems, this alignment is of great value to our customers and has been extremely well received. ", "Summarizing the product perspective, our technology is very strong and we, again, saw good renewal activity in our core businesses and excellent growth in the adjacencies. ", "Let me conclude with a few remarks on how we are managing our business. At the beginning of the year, we embarked on a 5-point plan to achieve high-single digit earnings per share growth. As evidenced by our guidance today, we're executing above plan and expect to deliver double-digit growth for the year. Revenue growth and profitability for our traditional solution is well on track, with good renewals and consistent growing share of customer budgets. We're also seeing incremental benefits of a multi-year effort to improve our contract terms and discounting. Our higher growth adjacencies are well on track, with IP and systems making up 20% of our top line. We have grown this business considerably and are seeing incremental margin improvement as well. ", "On the M&A side, we are successfully integrating the 8 acquisitions we made last year, while mostly absorbing the near-term operating margin pressure that results from deferred revenue accounting and typical integration costs. ", "In the area of efficient Financial Management, we continue to allocate resources and capital to areas of highest growth and to broadening our TAM. We executed our share repurchase strategy to keep share counts roughly flat, and we did slightly better here as well. ", "Finally, I would like to also highlight that we, again, expect a very strong cash flow from operations, exceeding $400 million for the year. To summarize, based on our results, backlog, business model and consistently strong earnings and cash flow, we feel that we are well positioned and fairly on a bullish track for the coming year. We look forward to talking more about our long-term strategy and plan at our Investor and Analyst event in New York on September 28. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q4 and the full year. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance. We have provided reconciliations in the press release and the financial supplement, which is posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Synopsys delivered a great quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in May. Q3 financial results were highlighted by strong orders, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we are raising our full-year outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow. ", "Total revenue was $387 million, an increase of 15% and slightly above our target range. Our IP and systems products continued their momentum and achieved double-digit revenue growth in Q3 and the trailing 4 quarters. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of third quarter revenue. ", "Turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $329 million, which included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets and $13.5 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $301 million, an expected year-over-year increase due mainly to our acquisitions, along with the timing of quarterly expenses such as the variable compensation impact that resulted from strong orders in the first 3 quarters of the year. ", "Non-GAAP operating margin was about 22% for Q3 and about 22.5% for the first 3 quarters of the year, as we worked through the integration of a number of 2010 acquisitions. ", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.35. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18% to $0.46, exceeding our target range, driven primarily by top line growth along with a lower effective tax rate and reduced share count. We are raising our annual EPS guidance, reflecting our strong third quarter and year-to-date results, along with our outlook for Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% for the quarter, below our target range due primarily to one-time tax benefits that resulted from a true-up of our FY '10 taxes. As a result, a non-GAAP tax rate for FY '11 of 22% to 23% is a reasonable estimate. For modeling purposes, we think that a 26% non-GAAP tax rate is a reasonable estimate for 2012. ", "Greater than 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 5% of total. This is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. ", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was 2.7 years. We expect average duration overtime to be approximately 3 years. ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong, with over $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Of our total cash balance, 33% is onshore and 67% is offshore. We generated $310 million in cash from operations, including an expected annual payment from a large customer in the quarter. We are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to more than $400 million, driven primarily by increased volume of bookings and timing of collections for the year. ", "Operating cash flow can be lumpy from year-to-year, which is why we believe it's important to focus on multiyear averages. For the 3-year period ended in Q3 of '11, trailing fourth quarter operating cash flow was on average about $354 million. ", "Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter, consistent with our operating plan, resulting in free cash flow of $288 million. For the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $55 million. ", "During the quarter, we purchased 3.8 million shares of Synopsys stock for $100 million. During the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we spent $335 million, repurchasing 12.4 million shares, and we have $413 million remaining on our current authorization. When factoring in cash generated from options exercised year-to-date, we spent a net $222 million on repurchases. ", "Fully-diluted share count declined sequentially and the year-over-year to $148 million as a result of our year-to-date share repurchases. ", "Continuing on with our balance sheet items, Q3 net accounts receivable totaled $175 million and DSO was excellent at 41 days, reflecting the high quality of our A/R portfolio. ", "Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $754 million, and we ended Q3 with approximately 6,650 employees. ", "Now let's address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 guidance. Our GAAP targets exclude any future acquisition-related expenses that maybe incurred in Q4 and beyond. For the fourth quarter of FY '11, our targets are: Revenue between $386 million and $392 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $329 million and $341 million, which includes approximately $50 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $300 million and $305 million. Other income and expense between 0 and $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of between 24% and 25%; outstanding shares between 146 and 150 million; GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.31 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.44 to $0.46 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. ", "Now our fiscal 2011 outlook. We're raising our revenue range, with our new target between $1.531 billion and $1.537 billion, primarily reflecting higher-than-expected business levels; other income and expense between $3 million and $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of between 22% and 23%; outstanding shares between $148 million and  $152 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.46 and $1.51, which includes the impact of approximately $57 million in stock-based compensation expense and the Q2 IRS settlement of $32.8 million; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.81. We've increased the low-end of our guidance range by $0.09 and the high-end by $0.04. Our current range represents year-over-year double-digit growth of approximately 12% to 13%, which exceeds our beginning-year commitment to deliver the high-single digit earnings growth in FY '11. And as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of more than $400 million. ", "In summary, we're really pleased with our Q3 financial performance, highlighted by strong top and bottom line growth and significant free cash flow generation. And we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst event, which should be held on September 28. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Richard Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Aart, I'm sure you don't want to talk about the fiscal '12 guidance right now, but I'm wondering if you could just refresh us on how you characterize the different pieces of -- the growth rates of the different pieces of your business. Before, you know you have 80% that I think you call core EDA. I think you have said that has roughly a mid-single digit long-term growth rate and then you've got 20% in the IPN system, which, I think, you've characterized as maybe 15% or so. If you could just sort of refresh us on those and tell us if you think those rates sort of still apply?", "Aart de Geus", "I don't think there's much to refresh, you just gave the answer, roughly. We are in low- to mid-single digits for the core EDA. We said double digits for the IP and systems area, and then there are a variety of other smaller components that have their own growth rate. But fundamentally, for the year, we entered the year with expectations setting of high-single digits. We are exiting the year doing quite a bit better than that. And in general, I think we feel that the portfolio is strengthened because some of the high growth components are now a bigger percentage of our overall revenue. And so in that sense, I think we're heading in the right direction.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "And based on your comments, it doesn't sound like you're seeing any adverse impact from some of the macro headwinds, if you will, out there. But just, if you could give us maybe a little more color on sort of what you're seeing from your customers in terms of EDA spending despite some of the obvious sort of negative headlines in certain semiconductor areas, if you will.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, of course, our customers read the newspapers, too. And so they -- on one hand share the concern. On the other hand, they also share the rates forward towards being very competitive in areas of high growth. And no matter how what happens to the economy, I think electronics will outperform the economy just because the demand for, especially the mobile devices, the many Internet interaction capabilities is very, very high. I think one of the other reasons that we are probably feeling, actually, very good market results is that even if there were any challenges in the overall market, we are definitely a very, very safe bet for customers because we provide complete solutions. We can help them streamline their expenses while staying extremely competitive. So whichever scenario ultimate plays out, and far for me to be able to tell which one it is, I think we are in a very good position.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Great. And could you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing? I think for years, we've seen pretty significant price pressure within EDA. Recently, we've actually heard some talk of prices actually going up in certain instances. I'm just wondering if you could give any color on what you're seeing from a pricing perspective?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, it's certainly encouraging to hear a number of people actively speaking about pricing as being an important component to do well in our market. As you know, I think we've been quite disciplined for now a long time. We have a business model that has extremely high degree of linearity and we manage the contracts within, all in all, a fairly tight window, which is typically around 3 years or so. And so that stability gives us an opportunity to be quite watchful about the overall terms. But on top of that, in the last few years, we have step-by-step put a bit more emphasis on how to improve the contract. And the fact that we hear from, obviously, in our industry that they're heading in the same direction is very encouraging.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC", "Great. And one final one, if I could just -- with respect to your operating margins. I think this year, you had some pressure from the integration of numerous acquisitions, especially Virage. And I think you've been investing pretty aggressively developing some new IP. Is there any reason to think some of those pressures wouldn't abate at least somewhat as we move into next year and maybe see some upward move on the operating margin on a year-to-year basis?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, so I think you understand the overall picture quite well. You're correct that actually more than just this year, even in the previous year, we did put a high degree of emphasis during the downturn to continue to invest both in technology and in serving the customers. The acquisitions bring with them, as you know, a revenue haircut and then a number of cost of integration, and also on our companies that have a lower ops margin than what we have. We have managed to mostly absorb that but definitely the ops margin has been at the lower end of what we normally would manage towards. Going forward, without making a hard commitment at this point in time, given that the guidance will be really done at the end of the fourth quarter, we are looking at the fact that it's possible to put a little bit more emphasis on the ops margin towards the positive. And so I think at this point in time, I would say there should not be any negative surprises by the time we give you guidance.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Aart, if I could just to follow up a little bit on a couple of Richard's questions vis-a-vis ambitions for 2012. It sounds like the revenue line, especially given a higher mix of IP, et cetera, you feel pretty good about. It sounds like -- from your previous answer, that we shouldn't expect anything negative on the operating margin side. In terms of your own R&D intensity, et cetera, in this business, given all the shift, is there, in fact, an opportunity to move, do you think, overtime? Not looking for any short-term commitment but operating margin significantly up beyond the -- getting back some of the pressure that some of the acquisitions cost? I mean, you're running sort of 23-ish, 22%. Can you move that back into the mid-20s, even upper 20s? How do you think about that just generally?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we have been on record for now a long period of time, saying that the longer-term ambition was towards the mid-20s. And we certainly would only say that if we thought that actually was not only possible but desirable. And as you well know, there's always a tension pair between, on one hand, having no end to wanting to do more investments, on the other hand, also wanting to have higher profitability as it generates the cash with potential M&A. And the M&A is mostly important to actually broaden our TAM. And we are step-by-step doing that and actually see some of the positive effects of that very strategy of the last 3, 4 years. And so in general, I do agree with the tenor of your question, and I don't want to turn this entire earnings release into the guessing for guidance for next year. But if there's one more comment coming out of, not only this quarter but really the sum of the year so far is, we're building a very solid backlog that allows us, again, to enter the next year with a high degree of confidence. And once you have that, it allows you to focus on some of the other financial variables. And we do want to put a high degree of emphasis on the P&L profile of the company to generate more shareholder value.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Would it be reaching too far to take that as an ambition beyond high single-digit earnings growth in the next year or is that stretching?", "Aart de Geus", "The notion of standing on thin ice and going further and further applies to this discussion. Let's keep the -- both the strategy discussion will be at the September meeting and then the hard guidance should be complete by the end of our fiscal year. But I think, in general, we are thinking about the company, both of course, in terms of technology, investment, but also, in terms of the financial management that we want to apply more systematically. And there are many opportunities to see how we can tune to make the company even stronger.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC", "One follow-up if I might, just on capital structure and cash. You're generating, you have probably one of the most visible models around semiconductors. You've talked about some of the attributes that give you that visibility, vis-\u00e0-vis the model, et cetera. You're generating tons of cash. I think you have somewhere around $7 of cash. Can you just talk about the trade-offs as you see them, between buybacks, maybe even dividends and a model like this? Where are you in the thinking around capital structure, please?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, Raj, why don't I grab that one. The performance of our company is really strong again this year on cash flows, we've highlighted with our targets over $400 million. When you look at the structure of the business, we now have $340 million in the U.S. and the rest of our -- just over $1 billion of cash offshore. So again, we look very carefully at the blend of where that cash resides. And then, we've laid out pretty clearly that we're focused on growth, we're focused on M&A as a key ingredient of that growth, in addition to our organic growth, and we committed to keep our share count roughly flat. And again you can see a very strong impact on our buyback program this year, with spending $335 million of U.S. cash on that buyback to take our share count down, even a little bit actually this year, compared to where we were from the prior quarter and over last year. So those are the top 2 priorities. And at this point, we don't have dividends on the table as long as the company continues to grow, both the top line and the bottom line.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Within the comment about strong orders for the quarter, can you give us a sense that relative to your own expectation were there any one or two areas that really stood out?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in many ways, the areas that stand out is precisely what makes up the company. IP, again, did very well. We had a number of other individual products that really stand out by particular technical strengths, such as the whole physical domain. We have a number of products that we introduced in the last couple of years that are going well. IC Validator is a good example. And so it is all in all, relatively balanced, but it fits very well, I think, the make-up story that we have told you, are then exactly the facts of the growth rates that we see. In general, we were -- I don't think that we were surprised. I think we executed very well on all the transactions that came up. And I think mostly it is because we have very good relationships with the customers right now. And in many situations that -- they're involved in really, really sophisticated designs, and now that's good for us.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then, Aart. Can you give us a little bit more color, It wasn't completely clear about the agreements that you have in place with ARM, and exactly how that's going to -- how are you going to monetize that relationship over the next couple of years?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we are, of course, in different businesses. Their main business is in the processor business, where they are doing extremely well. We provide many of the things around that, be it some of the I/O, IP blocks, but mostly a large number of tools and especially, the tools support with their key customers. And one needs to understand what happens really at those most advanced customers that are typically in the mobile field. They are driving extremely hard on the cores of the processors and all the IP around that to be as high-performance as possible, and as low power as possible. And there's really a race among them. And so by being well aligned and having access to some of the IP from ARM in time and with the right support, we can actually make their cores shine in the hands of their customers. And so we have, I would say, probably, 1/2 of our worldwide support is dedicated to that type of task in the broad sense, embedding these cores in very complex chips. In addition, ARM has access for quite a number of years to our tools and hopefully, they can say the positive things about the quality and capabilities of our tools, it certainly helps them drive the state-of-the-art.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then last question. Brian, can you give us a sense given the strong orders, what did that do in terms of the variable expense in the sales and marketing line, in other words, how much higher was the sales and marketing than maybe you would have expected when you originally gave guidance?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, it is up over what we had originally anticipated for Q3, as both the bookings for this year and the outlook for bookings for the rest of the year came in higher than what we had anticipated. So as we look at the overall expenses, we're within the range, we're at the top end of that as we came through. So we managed to control the expenses within what we'd anticipated. But again, just reiterating, very strong bookings year, has come in stronger each sequential quarter, as far as performance again, against our anticipation. And again that was the biggest driver of our cash flow as well as we look at that from last quarter to this quarter. So nice diversity of accounts, high volumes, collections earlier than what we had planned on a historical basis, and very good performance in that. But we just had to manage those expenses all within our expectations.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Paul Thomas with Bank of America.", "Paul Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "One of your competitors went out of their way recently to highlight some competitive displacements at 2 top 10 semi customers. I know historically, there's a lot of back and forth amongst the competitors in this space. But this was the first time we heard a dollar figure of $10 million or more in annual revenue from these couple of agreements. So I wanted to ask you guys directly about it. Have there been any significant losses for Synopsys at any of the top 10 customers recently or is Synopsys market share stable and growing?", "Aart de Geus", "You know we have not seen any, and our market share feels very stable and growing and as much as $10 million is a great number, we do $1.5 billion, and so it doesn't -- it was not visible to us. And the reality is many of the very large customers have brought set of customer tool arrangements, sorry, and so frankly, we don't know what they're talking about.", "Paul Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, fair enough. On the average contract life, you've talked about the long term 3-year average, but you've been below that for several quarters. Now just wondering are you still getting sort of inter-contract renewals that are being down a little bit? Or is this a little more active management to get shorter contracts? Or is there anything going on, sort of near term that's going to go away later on to get that back to 3 years? Or how should we be thinking about that?", "Aart de Geus", "Sorry for interrupting you. I think in general, from our perspective, the contracts are sort of staying the same. At any point in time, the reality is one rarely goes to the end of a contract then renews for 3 years. And the way this works in practice is, more often than not is, after a year or so, the customer wants some additional tools or some different configuration. And then one tends to renew and re-up for the next 3 years. That is the most common situation. During the massive downturn, we saw that some of the people waited a bit longer, mostly because they didn't want to make any additional commitments from where they were. We are not seeing that recently. From quarter-to-quarter, there can be big changes, because it's a discrete number of contracts. You're right, I think in the last 3 quarters that it was a little bit below 3 years. We are of course, ask ourselves the question, the same question. But we have not really found any special line or reason to be either concerned or elated about.", "Brian Beattie", "And maybe just to add to that, Paul, we're at 2.7 years, last quarter 2.8 years, then 2.5 years the previous quarter. So we are seeing a little bit down from the 3.0 years average. But we still feel that 3.0s the target level -- is 2.9 years. So a couple of points, we believe in the full transparency and be able to demonstrate what it is. We say 3.0 years is the way to go. And the other really important part of that, is the inherent run rate of those deals when they come through, and we're very happy with the run rates, the annual revenue increases that we've seen on each of those contracts, and that's also very positive.", "Paul Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's very helpful, thank you. And maybe following up on the buyback question from earlier. So you did mention too in your prepared remarks that your share counts stepped down a little bit more, I guess, than normal quarter-over-quarter. And so if there's -- is there anything to read into that? And you guys getting a little more aggressive on buybacks or is that just kind of an anomaly with the stock compensation not chewing up to that in the short term?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, that's a good question. But again, we remain committed to keeping our share count roughly flat. And we exercise against a program we put in place that looks at the source of cash and how we can best apply it. And then as we went through the year, we exercised against our plan in the most recent quarter and the amount of exercises that came through towards the end of the quarter as the stock price had come down a little bit, came in less than anticipated. So we executed on our buyback the amount of exercises came in a little bit lighter based on the price. And we ended up in the lowest net stock position we've had in the last 2 years. So very, very good position to be in.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Maybe another cash flow question. Of the $400 million that you're projecting for this year are there any unusual or one-time items in there? Or is this the level you'd expect from this new revenue and earnings level?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. We wanted to highlight that when we looked at the 3-year average of our operating cash flow, it came in at $354 million. We are looking at a $400 million. And as you know, cash flow forecasting can be lumpy from year-to-year. The increase in our guidance from last year -- from last quarter, I should say, even from the beginning of the quarter, really all came as a result of increased collections. We had record levels of collections, reflecting a very strong business in our third quarter. We saw that both the level of bookings we anticipated came in higher volume-wise, as well as came in earlier in the year, and that again gives the opportunity for us to collect cash with the new negotiated terms that are put in place. So again, very happy with the amount of cash based on the bookings, but kind of highlighting that our average over the last 3 years have been about $350 million. So just to say, this is our, it's our, one of our record levels of performance, but it's hard to forecast, and it can be lumpy going forward.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then also you talked about 1/3 onshore, 2/3 offshore. What's the split for the, I guess the cash flow run rate at this point?", "Brian Beattie", "Oh, it's about 1/2 and 1/2, generating 1/2 of our cash in the U.S. and the other 1/2 outside of the country, based on where this comes through based on our current mix of profitability by region.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And has there been any changes in the laws as far as bringing cash back to the U.S.?", "Brian Beattie", "No, not yet. We're following the developments in Washington very closely. There have been a number of proposals on improved tax rates or repatriation, we're watching that really, really closely and support any initiative that does allow us to do that, and to bring back cash at more favorable rates.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "All right. Then switching gears a bit. Aart, when you look at the memory space, and going down to 2x nodes and talk about the vertical demand, and all this tech stuff, does this increase CDA intensity to offer memory or is it still pretty small or pretty low compared to logic?", "Aart de Geus", "It increases it. Every step to the next node down just brings a boat load of physics, if I can call it like that. And you may have heard about the very fact that Intel announced that they are betting on FinFETs. Think of FinFETs as transistors that instead of being flat, are vertical. And so it's a little bit like high-rise transistors, so to speak. Well, in order to build those things, the physics are extremely tricky, they're very thin, and it requires a lot of simulation. We are very well positioned with that because Synopsys is the prime provider of so-called TCADs, Technology Computer Aided Design, and TCAD in the last few years has had the breakthrough that it can now simulate 3 dimensions. Well, perfect timing because transistors are now 3 dimension. Well, the transition technology of course, is driven mostly by memory FPGA and processor people, because they are the leading edge of technology. And so the trend that you're highlighting, which is the smaller and smaller devices in Moore's Law, absolutely demands more TCAD, more extraction, more simulation, more sophisticated building of libraries and memories. And by the way also more sophisticated investments in IP blocks, and that serves us well again because our IP blocks will become of higher and higher value as they are more and more difficult to build. So we're lovers of Moore's Law, what can I say?", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "So do you view this as just kind of a continuation of the Moore's Law you've been on for 15 years or so, or is this, is there more of a step function now because of this move to the vertical transistor?", "Aart de Geus", "The funky thing with Moore's Law is because it\u2019s an exponential, it feels like every 5 years there's a step function because it's not just a little bit harder, it's a lot harder. At the same time, Moore's Law is certainly alive for now 45 or 50 years. And we can see today another decade, predicting beyond that is always a little haphazard. But for right now, we see people working at sub-10 microns, sort of, nanometers, sorry, not microns, nanometers. And these are extremely small devices and the hunger for more transistors will continue. So I think there's a lot of work to be done, and we're at the heart of that.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "And then finally, when you look at your business and you have 90% going into the quarter. Of that remaining 10%, is there some way to characterize the makeup of it? Is the difference in there the other 90%?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, it is. And the reason it is, is because IP tends to be a higher percentage of that because in many situations the IP is a shorter duration cell or in the number of cases also just an up-front cell. So that is -- that tends to fill the last 10%. And then of course, we also have a number of services, and there the services, essentially, are being accounted for upon delivery of certain milestones. And so as much as -- on one hand, it's great to have 90% going into the quarter, it's not like there's no work to be done. But having such a strong percentage in hand, of course, gives the degree of stability that's good for the company.", "Operator", "Next, we will go to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Aart, I would like to revisit that capital structure question. I mean, here we have -- it seems like the world is falling apart, but you are doing great, your bookings are up, your cash flows is great. And so what stops you from putting some leverage on the balance sheet? I mean, we have equipment companies which are so volatile, but even the equipment companies are putting some leverage on their balance sheets. So I don't understand why you would not consider that very seriously.", "Aart de Geus", "Nothing stops us from doing that. And as a matter of fact, we are extremely conscious of the fact that the interest rates have become very better and better. And so from the overall strength of the company, obviously, we can take on debt. That also only make sense if there is a good return to be had on that debt. And far from me to say that there will be or will not be, but it is also clear that if there is more of a downturn, having a strong position has a high degree of value, and we certainly have learned a lot of things from the last downturn. But again, I don't want to be quoted or so I think there is going to be a downturn. There are many questions and uncertainty, and in that landscape we are solid. If the market continues as it is today, our business will continue to grow well on its own volition. But in any case, we are very proactively considering all of these options all the time. Thank you.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, and one more question on the 28-nanometer. How would you characterize the design starts and adoption of 28-nanometer right now, compared to 40-nanometer at a similar stage?", "Aart de Geus", "Actually all in all, it's not dissimilar. We put 28 and 32 in the same bucket because technically they mostly are. And we've seen, for example, in the last quarter, the design tapeouts moved to 173 from 134 in the previous quarter. So we track these things quite carefully. And all in all, we are following sort of a 2.5 to 3 years cycle from 1 node sets to the next. So I think 28 is only, where all of the advanced design that's going to go to market in the next 18 months is being done. There are a number of people working at 20 and 22 already, so that's the next wave -- that's much of our deep technology emphasis is on, and then I said there are people already below that. But 28 is the node that all of the foundries are completely focusing on, as we speak.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And just one more follow-up on that. It seems like some of the comments from TSMC, that process technology is relatively better, compared to 40-nanometer, they have much better yield at 28-nanometer, but it seems like that it's taking longer to close the design or product qualified. So can you give your viewpoint as to what's happening? Why is TSMC seeing some push outs in terms of product qualification when your process technology is quite ready?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think in general, TSMC specifically, has put a high degree of emphasis and hard work on 28-nanometer, and I think they've done very well with that. At the same time, it is also clear that when you go to these smaller and smaller geometries, the tolerances of the technology become larger versus the size of the device. Well those very tolerances reflect themself directly inside of the design. And so what we have now clearly demonstrated, is that yield is about, I would say, 1/2 to 2/3 the results of design technology and about 1/2 to 1/3 the result of actually, manufacturing prowess. Well that's a very important statement because that says that the design community needs to become much more yield sensitive. Now if you compare that to let's say 10 years ago, where most people did designs and then they would send it to the fab and the fab would execute it and end of story. Well today, you have to really tune your design for yields optimization. And actually we have some very exciting tools that are doing well one is called, Yield Explorer that allows our users, the design community to find yield issues much more rapidly. Because there's one more component, it's not just the absolute number of how good is the yield, it is how good is the yield over time. Meaning when you start in a new node, it tends to be not so great and then you tune and tune, and tune, both on the fab side as well as on the design side, and then the yields moves up. That's called the yield ramp. And so the faster you ramp, the faster your chips become cheaper. And so it's in that context that Yield Explorer is doing very well. And actually, just in the last couple of days, I've had interactions with foundries that are optimizing and where Yield Explorer has been able to find some, essentially, bad situations in the design that immediately helped the resulting yield. So I think it's an opportunity for us, the design world and the manufacturing world are no longer disconnected.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Can you assign some kind of incremental opportunity you might have or the industry might have from this systematic yield issues or the design related to yield issue? I know that this was talked about long time ago, that was DFM, and now we don't hear that word that much. But I'm sure the problem was a lot more severe. Is that an area of growth? You talked about that, but is there a dollar amount you can think about for this segment?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we don't break out individual tools, but there's no question that the whole area that touches manufacturing for us, is actually of significant size. And the reason for that is because it contains things such as, the yield optimization techniques that I described, but also described -- contains the optical proximity corrections and there are 2. There's a whole new discontinuity in physics happening, the TCADs, that I mentioned earlier, which has gone 3-dimensional. And so the overall manufacturing tools TAM is probably around $500 million or so, and we must be doing, out the top of my head, I would say $175 million or something along those lines. So it's an area -- it's only that will remain very solid or potentially, growing a bit better than the core EDA.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will next go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "First, I'd like to ask a couple of interrelated financial questions. In the third quarter, your deferred revenue on the cash flow statement was about $122 million, which was an unusually large amount now as versus that $77 million in the third quarter the year ago. I don't know it's always tricky to compare one quarter versus another in EDA. But would that increase be a rough proxy for your level of bookings increase year-over-year? In addition, in 2010, you increased your backlog by $100 million, not counting the effect of acquisitions which were another $100 million. Would it be fair to say that in fiscal '11, you should be able to increase your year end backlog versus last year by at least another $100 million or so? Then a couple of follow-ups.", "Brian Beattie", "Okay. So the first answer is, no. It's not related to any specific customer activity. But just overall, that deferred revenues grew on our ability to invoice our customers, and of course, it does grow very traditionally in the third quarter. It grows compared to the prior quarter, based on the profile of our ability to invoice our customers in cases of annually, in advance, or even quarterly, in advance. It's a very typical program for us to see to a growth. This year was even stronger which relates to general bookings increase and generally, abilities to invoice customers based on terms and conditions that we have negotiated. So it's very strong and does give confidence as we move forward in the year. It is a factor that we do look at for managing cash flows, and it gives us a visibility into the amount that we've invoiced and that then therefore, has very high probability on collections from that point on. As far as the backlog, we did not comment at the beginning of the year of what the backlog would do for the year. We did commit each year that we will disclose the amount of backlog at the end of this year, which would be effectively in a earnings call schedule at the very end of November. And we'll give the numbers then at that point. So again, focus more on the run rate improvement, and not just on the absolute gross dollar values of the bookings, because those do move around an awful lot.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "For Aart, a couple of product and market questions. First, at the Design Automation Conference in June. The detailed Intel's architecture group gave a pretty interesting talk on the importance of the necessary transformation in EDA, as they put it. They were talking specifically, for example, about the need to optimize across all of systems software and silicon together. The question is, setting IP aside for the moment, how well do think Synopsys is positioned to meet those kinds of needs, particularly, at the systems level? Then one last one after that.", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. I think Gadi Singer gave the presentation and he is tasked of course to try to look at division that Intel has 4 more encompassing design development flow. And there's no question that for a lot of products, the system angle is becoming much, much more important. Now I don't want to give the impression that many people are looking at a completely integrated system to silicon flow, because there just too many tasks and they already specialize. In the systems area though, we have made substantial investments over the last number of years, and they range from tools that are IP algorithmic, architectural level at the very high end, and the companies that used to invest a lot in those were the high end communication company. We have a number of tools that are focused on the virtual prototyping, in other words, built a model of the hardware before the hardware exists. And in that context, we acquired a number of companies, and we have just released a product that integrates much of their efforts. We have some efforts at high-level synthesis. We have a number of efforts in the prototyping based on FPGAs, which is also the benefit that it can be connected directly to analog/mixed-signal boards, for example. So we have a lot going, is the bottom line. And at the same time, I think that this is just the beginning of a field that is still evolving quite a bit. I would add one more component though, which is that in that whole system thinking, one should also look at IP. Because in many ways, IP has 2 faces. And let me take memory blocks as an example. You can think of a memory block as a set of transistors that have been really, really polished physically to be optimally dense. Well, that's the low end of memory. You can also think of it as a -- almost a software device that can store ones and zeroes, well that's the system's perspective. And the fact that we have a very strong IP position, helps us again, in looking at the whole system area. So I think we are by far in a way in the strongest position of all the players, at the same time, it is still very, very much a beginning market.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "All right. Lastly, along the lines of some of the earlier questions about where your growth will come from. Synopsys already has the highest share in IC implementation, almost certainly the plurality of the market. And of course, you still lead in synthesis and that category has been doing better over the last year, and you still have very high share in simulation and analysis. So the question is, in what other areas might you look again enough share in the 2 [indiscernible] categories, that there would be a material impact on your run rates and total revenue?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, there are a couple of specific areas where we do not have a high share, and so physical verification would be a good example of that, the entire custom domain. We do not have all that much share in the implementation side, and so these are areas that we can grow into. Secondly, the overall EDA market, or EDA plus-plus is actually quite a bit larger than Synopsys. So the share battles will continue, and it's a competitive market. And so our ambition should be to do better and better. At the same time, we have been quite explicit that we want to use the strong position we have to use at least some of the capital strength that we have to broaden the TAM. And you have seen our IP story expand substantially. we have at least one nice little example in the optical area where we made an investment last year that is turning out to work extremely well, and so there are many opportunities, the demand for new capability is unstoppable at this point in time.", "I think we have arrived at the end of the hour. And so we'd like to thank you for attending the conference call. Hopefully, the takeaway is that we have very good results for the quarter, a strong outlook for the year and are very much looking forward to see a number of you, if not all, at the September analyst meeting. Thank you for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference today.

Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earning Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call will include commentary regarding our Q4 and fiscal 2011 results and also the definitive agreement to acquire Magma Design Automation, both of which we announced this afternoon.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results, our expectations about the timing and likelihood of closing the acquisition and about the potential benefits of the culmination. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2011, our earnings release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and our press release announcing the definitive agreement to acquire Magma issued this afternoon. ", "All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our fourth quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "In addition, the information we discuss on this conference call related to our intent to acquire Magma is for informational purposes only. This information is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. Magma intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission preliminary and definitive proxy statements and other relevant materials in connection with the proposed transaction. Before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the acquisition, investors are urged to read Magma's proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available because they will contain important information about the transaction.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm happy to report first on our excellent Q4 and fiscal 2011 results and our raised guidance for FY 2012 and second on the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Magma Design Automation, which we announced this afternoon.", "Let me begin with our results. Our business in Q4 was strong, closing an outstanding overall fiscal '11 and most importantly yielding an excellent position heading into FY '12. Specifically, in Q4, we delivered revenue of $391 million resulting in $1.536 billion for the fiscal year. This is 11% growth over FY '10. With non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 in Q4, we delivered $1.80 for the year, above the target range we communicated at the beginning of fiscal '11 and 13% growth over fiscal '10.", "In the process, we managed to a solid non-GAAP operating margin of 22.3% for the year while generating $440 million in operating cash flow. Our 3-year backlog grew to $2.5 billion and we have more than 80% of next year's plan revenue scheduled from current backlog. ", "In summary, a strong year with double-digit growth in both top and bottom line.", "Looking forward to fiscal year 2012, we are raising our outlook. While we're conscious of the continued economic uncertainty, our good momentum and backlog support an objective of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. We plan to achieve this goal on the basis of solid top line growth and improvement of our operating margin. Brian will give you more detail in just a minute. ", "Before moving to the business highlights, let me address today's announcement that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Magma Design Automation. This acquisition is motivated by our customers' need for further technology exploration and productivity. Indeed, today's chip designs requires customers to either deal with the very complex physics of advanced 28-, 20- or even 40-nanometer silicon or squeeze the last bit of performance, power and cost from designs at more mature nodes.", "Either way, the R&D and support demands to keep the state-of-the-art moving necessitate more invention and more investments. Bringing together the complementary technologies of Synopsys and Magma, as well as our R&D and support capabilities, will help us deliver advanced tools earlier, thus, directly impacting our customers demand for increased design productivity.", "As you can understand, although we wanted to share our enthusiasm about this combination, we have limited ability to comment about our specific plan until the transaction is closed. Brian Beattie will address some of the financial terms in just a moment.", "Looking at our business overall, we see our customers continue to drive design aggressively. Even in the context of the unsettled economy, we expect electronics to do relatively well as the main markets of mobile, cloud and smart everything remain quite vibrant. While the rate of growth in semiconductor revenue did slow in 2011, a good number of successful companies beat expectations and provided positive outlooks. Customers have shown that they will prioritize the next mobile connected device over almost any other discretionary purchase. At the same time, these devices push the limits of performance and power efficiency, demanding state-of-the-art EDA and IP solutions.", "Among our customers, the raise for differentiation is very much on which explains the rapid adoption of advanced design nodes such as 28- and 20-nanometer.", "In addition, development of FinFETs or vertical transistors will bring further density and power consumption improvements as well as additional requirements for leading-edge EDA solutions. In this context, EDA and third-party IP are crucial, and Synopsys is positioned well as the technology leader offering comprehensive and best-in-class solutions from system design to chip to manufacturing.", "Let me provide some highlights beginning with core EDA. Today, Synopsys enables the most advanced production designs in the world. For example, major customers, such as STMicroelectronics and Samsung, have already taped out their first 20-nanometer test chips share with our Galaxy Implementation flow. In Q4, we announced yet another major technology advance, the integration of our cornerstone IC Compiler solution with Custom Designer. Even though the product was just introduced, STMicroelectronics has already reported that it reduced its final layout preparation time by 25% compared to its previous flow.", "While the move to still smaller geometries -- with the move, sorry, to still smaller geometries, the bridge to manufacturing is increasingly critical to achieve acceptable yields in chip production. With our Yield Explorer tool, designers are now able to identify and correct areas in their design, which affects manufacturability. This can directly impact our customers' profitability.", "In Q4, another highly influential top 10 fabless company chose our solution. Synopsys is also the technology leader in FinFET support with tools throughout the flow. Our popular TCAD solution is where 3D transistor design begins. It simulates transistors at the near molecular level and is being used today by nearly every leading semiconductor manufacturer as well as many fab-light companies.", "The move to small geometries brings more high-value chip functionality, but the huge number of transistors on the chip also requires a tremendous amount of verification. In our own simulation, we're seeing good momentum as speed and ease-of-use enhancements are enabling us to win important benchmarks in business. LG Electronics, for example, selected Synopsys after we delivered a 10x acceleration over previous solutions.", "In digital, customers continue to depend on our flagship VCS product for their most advanced designs. VCS had a solid year and is poised well for FY '12, especially in all the advanced nodes and for complex chips, such as CPUs, graphics course and sophisticated networking chips.", "Our new optical products did very well in 2011 and we expect continued growth in '12. While a small part of our overall business, its performance illustrate the importance of simulation even beyond the electronic space.", "Now turning to IP and systems, which performed very well in 2011 and contributed 23% of total revenue. At the systems level, we successfully integrated a broad set of virtual platform technologies and acquisitions into a single offering, Virtualizer. Software development has become a large part of most chip design projects, and virtual platforms are of high value because they accelerate delivery of software by 6 to 9 months. ", "Another tool aimed at speeding software development and system validation is FPGA-based prototyping. Our hub solution have successfully demonstrated its effectiveness and demand has been very good.", "The other great source of productivity for our customers is Synopsys IP. As the complexity of IP blocks grows and external economic pressures continue, customers are increasingly reevaluating make versus buy decisions with more and more IP being outsourced. We estimate that well under half of IP is outsourced thus far, creating a substantial opportunity for Synopsys.", "During the year, we announced more than 40 design wins across more than 30 customers for our USB3.0 products. We had our largest year ever in PCI Express controllers, DDR and HDMI. And for the second year in a row, we received TSMC's Interface IP Partner of the Year Award. In FY '11, we delivered excellent revenue growth and improved profitability. Looking forward, we anticipate continued growth in this area as we further broaden our IP portfolio and as customers are already ordering IP for the more advanced nodes.", "In conclusion, we finished fiscal '11 strongly in terms of top line, bottom line, backlog, technology and customer relationships. Our predictable business model provides stability and supports continued investment even in the face of the stormy economic situation. We are confident in our ability to deliver healthy results for the fiscal year in our setting an objective for double-digit, non-GAAP EPS growth for FY '12.", "Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thanks, Aart, and good afternoon. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year, provide you with our 2012 guidance for Q1 and the full year and provide some financial details of the Magma transaction. As a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance, and we provided reconciliations and explanations in the press release, 8-K and financial supplement posted on our website. In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Now as Aart mentioned, Synopsys delivered a very solid fourth quarter wrapping up an outstanding year. FY '11 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation.", "Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials. Q4 total revenue increased 4% to $391 million and annual revenue grew 11% to $1.536 billion. Our IP and systems products continued their momentum and achieved double-digit revenue growth in Q4 and the year. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue.", "Greater than 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 5% of the total for Q4 and 6% for all of FY '11. This is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter and for the fiscal year was about 2.7 years. We currently expect average duration in fiscal 2012 to be between 2.7 and 2.9 years as we're seeing some customers refining their contract durations to match their particular design cycles.", "Three-year backlog increased to $2.5 billion from $2.4 billion with a book-to-bill slightly greater than one. And finally, we have greater than 80% of our target fiscal 2012 revenue in hand for the coming year and more than 90% for the coming quarter.", "Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP cost and expenses were $334 million, which included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets and $15 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.323 billion, which included $69 million of amortization of intangible assets and $56 million of stock-based compensation. ", "Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $305 million, well within our target range. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.193 billion, an expected increase due mainly to our acquisitions along with some year-over-year cost pressures, such as employee compensation and a variable compensation impact that resulted from strong orders and other key financial metrics.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 22% for the quarter and 22.3% for the full year. For all of FY '12, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '11 levels.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.27 for the quarter and $1.47 for the year compared to $1.56 for all of 2010. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% to $0.45, and full year non-GAAP earnings grew 13% to $1.80. FY '11 growth was driven primarily by top line growth and a lower effective tax rate and, to a lesser extent, reduced share count.", "Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 24% within our guidance range. For the full year, our tax rate declined to 22% due primarily to the reenactment of the federal R&D tax credit for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, which resulted in a certain onetime tax benefit in fiscal 2011. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate between 25% and 26% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2012.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Of our total cash balance, 23% is onshore and 77% is offshore. Of course, our U.S. balance reflects our share repurchase program and 2 small acquisitions during the year, both funded with U.S. cash.", "We generated $73 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $440 million for all of fiscal 2011. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of approximately $300 million in FY '12.", "As we reiterated at our New York Investor Meeting last quarter, operating cash flows tend to be lumpy from year-to-year, which is why we believe it's important to focus on multiyear averages. For the 3-year period ended in FY '11, annual operating cash flow was on average, about $340 million.", "We expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments.", "Now continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items, capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter and $57 million for the year. Our fiscal 2012, we see capital spending coming in approximately $50 million.", "During the quarter, we purchased 1 million shares of Synopsys' stock in the open market for $25 million and also entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement or ASR for $75 million. Under this agreement, we received 1.7 million shares in Q4 and expect to receive the balance of approximately 1.1 million shares in Q1 when the ASR is completed.", "For all of fiscal 2011, we were aggressive with our balance sheet and spent $435 million repurchasing 15.1 million shares, buying back 4x as many shares as we granted during the year. We have approximately $313 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "Now in factoring in cash generated from options exercised during the year, we spent a net $299 million on repurchases. FY '11 fully diluted share count declined 1.5 million to 150 million shares. And more importantly, Q4 share count declined 5.6 million year-over-year to 146.4 million as a result of our share repurchases.", "Continuing on with the balance sheet items. Q4 net accounts receivable totaled $203 million and DSO is 45 days, reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $760 million and we ended Q4 with approximately 6,800 employees. Now while we selectively grown our headcount primarily through acquisitions, we continue to have about 1/3 of our total employees in the lower-cost geographies. We also renewed our credit facility in Q4 for $350 million. This revolver, which may be increased by an additional $150 million, provides excellent flexibility in supporting our business operations.", "Now some of the financial details of the Magma transaction. The value of the transaction is approximately $507 million. Net of cash and debt acquired were $7.35 per Magma share, which we intend to fund using a combination of U.S. cash and debt, the specifics of which will be determined as we approach the close. Subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review and other customary closing conditions, including Magma's shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the second calendar quarter of 2012.", "Given the timing of the anticipated close, we expect the combination to be modestly accretive to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We will update 2012 guidance at the time of close.", "Now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes Magma and any future M&A. Our GAAP targets also exclude any future acquisition-related expenses, which may be incurred in Q1 and beyond. So similar to what we saw in fiscal 2007, we have an extra week in fiscal 2012 that occurs in the first quarter. For the first quarter of FY '12, our targets are revenue between $412 million and $420 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $340 million and $357 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $310 million and $320 million; other income expense between 0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 24% and 25%; outstanding shares between 145 million and 149 million; GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.38 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.53 per share. And we expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog. ", "Now our fiscal 2012 outlook. Based on what we know now, we expect revenue between $1.64 billion and $1.665 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 8%; other income and expense between 0 and $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate between 25% and 26%; outstanding shares between 145 million and 149 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.28 and $1.44, which includes the impact of approximately $61 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 to $1.99; and cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million.", "Now finally to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2012 quarterly revenue and expense profile. At this time, revenue in the first half is expected to be higher than the second half, reflecting the extra week in Q1, which contributes about $25 million to revenues. We expect Q2 revenue to be similar to Q1, reflecting timing of certain deals, deliverables and consulting milestones, and the second half revenue to be evenly distributed between Q3 and Q4.", "At this time, we expect Q1 expenses to be higher than what's typical of our business due to the extra week, a sequential decrease in Q2 and Q3, which is moderately below our traditional higher Q4. As a result, we expect Q2 to be the highest quarter for non-GAAP earnings per share with Q3 and Q4 roughly equal, again, due to the timing of revenues.", "So in summary, we're very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth, and strong cash flow generation. We look forward to another year of solid business execution.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Lisa for a word before we open it up for questions.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Brian. We know there will be a lot of questions today. So to help us accommodate everyone, we'd like to ask a favor and request that you try to focus on one or 2 questions at first, and then we'll of course come back around after we give everyone a chance to ask additional questions.", "Thank you very much, and I'd like to turn it over to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess to start with -- off on the acquisition, Aart, with all due respect in your comments, you suggested that Magma's complementary to you, guys. But it -- most people would suggest, I think, that they have quite a bit of overlap with your core businesses. So just wondering how you think about how much overlap there is there. How much do you see is not overlapping? And how do you sort of deal with that potentially from a regulatory perspective?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, as you know, EDA is a very competitive field with constant innovation and many tools with many different capabilities and often catering to different subsegments of the market. Simultaneously, as I highlighted in my preamble, what we're seeing right now, and when I mean right now, I'm really meaning the last 18 months or so, is just a tremendous acceleration of technology demand. And I think it's partially due to the fact that there is so much opportunity in some of the mobile devices that demand really state-of-the-art technology, that the advances needed suggest keep up with what the customers need will require substantial R&D investment and also substantial technical support. And so it's in that context that there's no question that we will be able to jointly much better support the customer. As a matter of fact, we have already gotten a wave of very positive feedback from the customers that we've spoken to.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And I mean, just a follow-up on that, have you done any sort of preliminary -- any trust analysis? Do you have any feel for how this might be viewed? Obviously, Magma much smaller in scale than the other 3 big players, which I think would be something in your favor but still a lot of overlap. Do you have any initial feel for that? Anything you can share with us?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, of course, I cannot go into any of the details, but we understand perfectly the process of going through the governmental steps. And of course, we do our homework beforehand very carefully. But in that context, we will engage with the government on these issues as we have done in the past and our confidence in the outcome.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And just one quick one, if I could, for Brian. When you talk about being somewhat accretive or modestly accretive in the fiscal '12, does that include the expected loss of deferred revenue from Magma?", "Brian Beattie", "It does, Rich. Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, if I could follow up on Rich's line of questioning just a bit. And congratulations, I actually think it's quite a good deal. Is your plan -- to the extent that you can discuss it at all, is your plan to keep 2 platforms in digital sort of your Galaxy platform entails where there is overlap? Or would you anticipate over sometime taking sort of the best of both worlds and creating a new sort of optimized level for some of the leading-edge customers that you've talked about?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good question. And I'm sure you understand, we cannot comment about specific plans partially because these plans can only be finalized and developed once we have closed the deal. But there are 2 fundamental principles that we follow. And the first principle is a very, very important one, which is do not disrupt the customer. In both our values and maybe our business thinking, it is very clear. Customers absolutely rely on us for chips that are vital to their success, and we will continue to support them being successful through all of those chips. Simultaneously, in the long-term, we -- actually, in the short-term, we also follow the principle of understanding where the most rapid developments in technology are needed. And as mentioned earlier, the race is very much on in technology. And so long term, we will obviously deliver more precise road maps once this is closed. But long term, we absolutely have to lead the state-of-the-art. This is important for not just the EDA industry. It is important for the semiconductor industry. And there are a lot of opportunities there. So we have a lot of work ahead of us here.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. I mean, given that both these flows are somewhat integrated, you mentioned a lot of work, how long do you think it takes to resolve these kinds of issues in the customer base notwithstanding your commentary on that one to disrupt them? Is this something that you would anticipate in this domain? It takes, I don't know, 1 year 18 months? Or is this something that even takes longer? And then I'm just curious as it relates to the attractiveness of Magma. They have had some success certainly in Fine [ph], Sam [ph] and some of the other simulation products they have. Was there -- aside from the obvious advantages of taking some of the tele stuff and some of those customers under your wing, was there something particular in the products that was or has become more attractive to you and the -- recently that help drive your decision to do this now?", "Aart J. de Geus", "So obviously, I cannot comment about specific products at this point in time. But what is clear, and I want to emphasize that. When you say how long will it take for customers to know, they should know immediately. We will support them. It's that simple. We care first and foremost about their success with whichever tools they use, and we will continue to do that as much as we possibly can until they tape out successfully and probably long beyond that. At the same time, road maps are actually almost a misnomer because the road keeps changing very rapidly in our field. And so I think we have an opportunity here to think through what are the things that in the long term will have the biggest impact on our customers. And we have such a large number of requests and demands from the customers right now that I'm not worried at all that we will not be able to really make a difference for the customers soon after we close the transaction.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. And just a quick one for Brian. Brian, in your accretion commentary, are you assuming some meaningful cost reductions out of the combination? You've mentioned to Rich that deferred was accommodated in that commentary? Are you -- do you have a number in terms of the channel cost or anything else to come out that you're assuming?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, I think these are all that the forms of the details are going to be worked out as we work through the regulatory approvals over the next little while. But certainly, as we look at the company, I think there are certain levels of synergies you might expect to come through. So as we see that plus the revenue, some -- we see the deal is modestly accretive in FY '12, assuming that it can close in the second quarter -- calendar quarter of next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I want to keep beating a dead horse here. In terms of the regulatory environment that we're in, the deal is like you've got #1 buying #4. We see this in a much larger case that's out there. When I look specifically at SPICE simulators and even the strong combined market share on digital place-and-route, what is it that gave you the confidence that you felt that you can move forward and get a transaction like this stuff?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, you're beating indeed a dead horse. We won't go much deeper in this area, but we did very good due diligence on these areas. We have seen that it's an extremely competitive landscape with actually many more players than what you're mentioning. And so our sense right now is that we're on a good track, but we will follow the rules and work with the HSR authorities to make this the right thing.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So LAVA moved over to subscription basically about the same time they cadenced it. So thinking about how the combined financials will look, Brian, are you anticipating of having like a non-GAAP revenue where you're actually going to add back the deferred revenue that's written down and that's part of the accretion that we're talking about?", "Brian Beattie", "No, Sterling, we typically don't do that. In the case, if you look at Magma's financials, there was just approximately $20 million of deferred revenue backlog. So relative to the entire size of the company, it's not that significant. So again, people know what the amount is. We typically do not adjust for that. I think the results will be pretty visible as we complete the transaction. And we'll build that into the guidance as the deal closes, and we'll update our outlook for 2012 at that point.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right, great. And last question just on the core business, you're finishing up a strong year, you ended the shortened contract durations, you made some commentary there. Just as you look at the macro environment and some of the comments coming out of semis, do you think that the contract durations that you've included are short enough? Could we actually go to an even shorter level as we move into 2012? Or does it just not make economic sense then to go much shorter?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Actually, I'm in the second camp. I don't think that it's going to be much shorter. It's possible that people want to go a little bit shorter if they feel a high degree of uncertainty of the overall markets around us. And you know more about it than I do, but we all observe the -- our screens being red one day and green the next based on the effects that have really nothing to do with the semiconductor industry. But obviously, there's a certain degree of nervousness overall. Having said that, it is precisely the mall that we have and the really strong backlog and, relatively speaking, very long commitments that we have that gives us the ability to weather any storm very well. And it is particularly positive to be able to move forward on this transaction at the time where our own results for the year were good, our outlook is very solid. And as you have heard, we have a very large portion of our FY '12 business already scheduled in hand. And so in that sense, no matter what, I think there are few companies that have the degree of stability and solidity that we have in light of the degree of uncertainness and question marks around it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Thomas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Paul B. Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess if you look at the guidance, the full year guidance for Synopsys standalone, you're in the 7% to 8% range. And if we take out the extra week, you'd be a little bit below that. And if, Aart, we look back to your previous commentary about what you'd expect from a normal year for core and system IP growth, it seems like you might be in line with that to a little bit less than that. And so I just wanted to get your sense of do you think that this year is starting out as a little bit below what you might expect for a normal year? Or are you just being conservative at this point?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think we may have the reputation that we're conservative and we tend to deliver well on commitments, let's say. But at the same time, no, my sense is not that we're starting off particularly weak. On the contrary, I think that as a company, we feel that we have good momentum. But not to -- to beat another dead horse, which is the economy around us, there's clearly a certain degree of uncertainty about what may happen. And not that that necessarily changes the actual outcome on markets, but it does change a little bit the caution that customers will display. And so in that context, we actually feel that we're doing quite well. Now maybe digging -- slightly deepening your question in a different angle, which is we've said before that the growth in core EDA is less high than some of the new areas that we're growing in. And so for example, if you look at the IP area, we are clearly doing very well there. And some years, we'll see a little bit more core EDA then expect that some years we'll see a little more IP than expected. But in aggregate, we felt comfortable enough that without any M&A, we are right now setting an objective of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. And that is definitely more aggressive than what we did last year even if we delivered more than what we have promised.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just one question on LAVA, is there a breakup fee in no shop or go shop provision at all?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, there is some. Included in the definitive agreement, which we signed this afternoon, is a standard breakup fee of 3.25%. That's about $17 million the value. There's also a reverse breakup fee of $30 million that we would pay Magma. So it works on both sides of the agreement, and you'll see all the details in the definitive agreement.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, and who are the advisors on this one?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, on our side, we did not use excellent advisors. We had, of course, a number of legal counsels, specifically Dewey & LeBoeuf. On the Magma side, you can ask them, but they use Catalyst.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Aart, has something happened with the business as far as normal seasonality? I mean, usually your fourth quarters are quite strong. And it seems like the last couple of years, it's become a lot more evenly split through the year.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Oh yes, and there's a good reason for that is because these are the benefits of much more ratable businesses. Yes, you have the very natural and good objective setting and human behavior that, at the end of the year, you really want to close all the deals that you've been working on. And so, therefore, there are tends to be always somewhat of a push in any business, ratable or not, in that context. But from a utilization of tools and from a revenue recognition point of view, the 2 things reflect each other now very well. And so in that sense, this is the part of the positive outcome of having moved to a much more ratable business model. Now there's a small percentage of this that is not completely ratable because it tends to be attached to either specific milestones or IP delivery. And with IP growing, you will see a slight increase there. At the same time, though, there's a certain base of IP business that keeps happening every quarter. So even there, you don't see all that much fluctuation. And given that people really buy IP when they need it, meaning when they have projects, there's not like over purchasing massively occurring there. And so it's, in that sense, also a fairly predictable revenue stream. So I think we have a very balanced model that is well-suited for multi-year technical and support investments, which is what our customers care about.", "Brian Beattie", "And maybe I'll just add, with the transparency, of course, and that we have the visibility using $2.5 billion of backlog that we profile out over the next 3 years, we have that greater than 80% of the full year already booked. And that profile, as you know, we split that by customer, we split the cash flows by customer, by quarter. So we can really get an excellent level of visibility, and that's what you see relative to the quarterly profiles. We just wanted to give you all of the transparencies on the quarter 1, quarter 2 shifts, quarter 3 and 4 for the year. So no surprises during the year and we're committed to delivering on that.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Brian, for I didn't hear, did you mention anything about the go shop provision?", "Brian Beattie", "No, I did not. No.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "So that's in there right now?", "Brian Beattie", "No.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then I was curious, with your book-to-bill being around 1 for the year, did the acquisitions impacted any of the direction?", "Aart J. de Geus", "For -- are you talking about the past year?", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes, for 2011.", "Aart J. de Geus", "No, of course, because we have done many acquisitions over the years. They layer in overtime. Once a company gets acquired, of course, gradually, actually reasonably fast, the revenue becomes indistinguishable of the other revenue. And so if some of you had the opportunity to attend our investor presentation in New York a couple of months ago, I tried to explain that the way we grow is really through a combination of investing in new technology ourselves as well as acquiring technology. And so all of these things are part of a business model that has been honed over many years and is working well for us.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. I was kind of curious that the book-to-bill have been close to one even without acquisitions.", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, it's really not a big factor at all at least. If you looked at the acquisitions, the largest we did in the fourth quarter of last year of 2010, I should say. And the impact relative to bookings level is new deals get booked as they were. The backlog comes over as it were. And then the revenue, as you know, gets a bit of a revenue haircut due to some of the deferred revenues that were on the balance sheet. And then that folds in over the year. So again, just relative to our total business, it's really an insignificant impact on the book-to-bill.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, when you look at the $300 million projected for cash flow next year, what is the projected kind of onshore, offshore mix of that?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, we have our certain balance right now of 23%, 77% of our billion dollars in cash. As we go forward on operating cash flow, it's split about 50/50 of onshore and offshore cash.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Again, congratulations on the acquisition. Assuming that most of this, the revenue from Magma side, will come from place-and-route, can you, Aart, can you refresh us on the market place-and-route mark in terms of what are the market shares and what are the features of different products? And how will the -- will combining your product with Magma, does that give you a pricing advantage but less number of players in the market?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, the place-and-route market is extremely competitive with many players. And moreover, most of the players have multiple place-and-route systems. Yes, we, ourselves, have, I think, 4 routers or something like that. And so all of these things tend to end up being quickly specialized in multiple dimensions, be it detailed route, be it block route, be it talk to your routing or a top level routing. And then even there, there are specializations for different end markets. And so there's really a plethora of technology. And the very fact that customers have time -- have a hard time in knowing what are the strengths and weaknesses of each of the customers makes it impossible for me to go into detail here. But suffice to say, this is an area that sees continual evolution and innovation and new entrants and quite a large numbers of players. And I think our challenge is going to be to just to live up to the expectations of the customers that we have, and we have done well and it's never been an easy journey.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But does having a bigger pipe -- bigger pie, does that help you in terms of pricing going forward?", "Aart J. de Geus", "No, I don't think so. The -- fundamentally, this is extremely competitive market. I know that many of you have asked pricing questions for many years. The reality is that most of the pricing question is actually answered in a very different area, which is the content, meaning that the rate of change of what customers get for the same dollar is astronomically high, meaning we deliver really a large number -- a large amount of value and continually changing value. Now at times, we try to explain that to the customer and they say, \"Yes, well, and so do we.\" Meaning that they, too, for the same size chips get about the same amount of money while delivering dramatically new capabilities. That's the nature of high tech. And so I think that none of these things are won or lost on pricing. They weren't on lost on the basis of driving technology forward and being really there for the customer when they need you in support. And that is really what we're focusing on in how we build Synopsys.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And one last question, Brian. How should we think about in terms of your cash requirement to -- I mean, right now you have just, what, $230 million onshore. How much do you need to run the business? I would think that the remaining you'll have to issue a debt, is that a right way to think about?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, what we covered today as well is the renewal of our line of credit facility with very attractive rates, just renewing what we had in place earlier, and that's up to $350 million. So as we look forward, we'll have more details of this as we complete all of the acquisition-related activities over the next 6 months. It's also, of course, a period where we will generate additional cash for the business. And at that point, we'll be determining to what extent do we use a relatively low cost line of credit plus our U.S. cash we've got available. And as many transaction you have on a global basis, you do sometimes have to put your IP into some of the other jurisdictions. And that also requires, in some ways, some of the offshore cash. So a lot of details to be worked through. But again, we're in very good shape relative to the cash and the cash availabilities. We do not have any use of our line of credit already. And we're in full compliance with all the covenants built into those agreements as well. So we're in very good shape.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Aart, I'd like to ask if there's anything instructive from your experience with the Avanti acquisition a decade ago or what might occur with the Magma acquisition. What I mean is, you bought then a company that was barely overlapping with Synopsys, but it took you a number of years longer to fully benefit from the integration of their complementary technology. And so again, the question is, do you think that there's anything that is destructive from that experience if you're maybe able to apply it to LAVA?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, actually a very interesting question. We pride ourselves for being a learning company and one can argue how good we are at that. But there's no question that -- not just the Avanti acquisition but a number of others, each one of those have taught us new facets. I think it's important to start one of the fundamental principles back to it is all about the customer. And so no matter what we think about our plans and directions and technology, the first thing to do is to make sure that the customers are successful during this. Secondly, you're right that sometimes how one integrate or how one leverages new technologies or how one invents new things is very much a function of how one executes. And of course, we've learned many management lessons on how to do that better, how to set the objectives aggressively while at the same time not short-shifting the support of the existing customer. And so I think we will be able to execute more rapidly than in the past. But at the same time, I think it's also clear that the external landscape has evolved significantly since the mid of the last decade. And so it will be very important to involve customers in helping us at some of the key priorities because we're getting so much feedback of them wanting us to do even more than what we're doing today. So it's another learning experience, I guess, but we definitely benefit from the teachings of the past.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Could you comment on how LAVA helps you with your adjacency strategy particularly in the area of System-Level design or anything else you may care to mention?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, yes, of course, there are many adjacencies. And each one of these technologies have some key angles that are very valuable. Maybe highlighting one, which is the whole custom analog/mixed-signal domain is one where an enormous amount of invention actually is needed or maybe innovation is a better word, because it is clear that not only has analog/mixed-signal design not lived up to the same rate of productivity increase, it is -- in addition, if I can use the term harassed by the physics of small dimensions in a fashion that's actually tougher than on some of the design side -- of the digital sides. And so I think they are the areas here that can be exciting for us going forward. But this is all looking into the future at a time where we don't have specific plans ready yet. And so we'll communicate when we're ready. But the space around us is still very, very big.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a market follow-up and one quick one for Brian. At the Analyst Meeting, John mentioned that by your estimation, about 1/10 of the typical cost of an IC or semi-project is comprised of EDA tools. And I don't know if that was a specific or limited case example you were giving. But could you comment on that ratio, particularly in the context of all the technology and market pressures you refer to, if there's a possibility that that proportion, that 1/10 share that you mentioned might possibly go up?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Maybe I should take care of that question, Jay, if you don't mind. The challenge with these statements, of course, is they're always directionally very correct, and the second decimal point is always very suspect in terms of putting exact numbers. What is clear, though, and we are seeing it with our customer engagements, is that the depths of the engagement is becoming very different than just 3 or 4 years ago. And the reason for that is simple, which is, a, the customers on the outside feel very much the pressure of having markets that are increasingly a little bit winner takes all and are very fast. And so you cannot miss the tape out wall. Secondly is that what they are attempting to do on these chips is complex in every dimension you can think about. And by the way, the EDA tool, the word ease-of-use as much as a positive, is continually in conflict with the necessity to be incredibly capable from a technology point of view, i.e. is another way of saying this is not best of value that's easy-to-use. In other words, your support is only becoming much more than support. It is absolutely being a member of the design team. And I think it's much more collaboration anything else. Therefore, the conclusion has to be that customers that start to appreciate what we actually can do to help them differentiate rather than just be part of their cost equation will do much better. And we definitely have evidence of that with the number of customers where we'll take some pride in their success because we know it was done together in its set of differentiation. And the moment one moves more into the space of helping customers differentiate rather than just be part of their cost equation, which by definition is always under pressure, I think we have a good opportunity. And I think this applies to the entire EDA industry not just to Synopsys. And that's maybe the reason you hear all in all recently good results from all the participants in our industry.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just one last in for Brian. Could you comment on the degree of operating margin improvement in the IP business in fiscal '11? And could you perhaps talk about the extent of improvement you might see in fiscal '12 in IP?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, we don't break out all the details down to the margin level. As you can see from the revenue growth in IP and systems, as a result of the acquisitions and our organic growth, we grew by 75% on the top line. And along with that came a very nice improvement in the operating margins for that business as well. And again, that is what we're counting on to continue in 2012 as we've committed to expand our operating margins in the year. And again, we have long-term targets we're continuing to work towards. But again, a nice improvement in 2012 compared to where we are at the end of '11.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to a follow-up question with Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Brian, I want to drill into the idea. You mentioned the $20 million of deferred revenue. So Magma had about $300 million of backlog coming into this fiscal year, they have the July fiscal year. So my question is this. As you go through the accounting on the merger, would it only be the deferred revenue write-down that you wouldn't get a chance to put through the income statement? If they haven't actually issued an invoice for, let's say, an annual collection on a 3-year deal as they're paying once a year, does -- a big chunk of that backlog, is that still eligible to come through the income statement for the combined company?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes. I can't comment on the specifics of their business, but I'll give you the update on how the accounting is done. And what happens is you do look at the deferred revenues at the point of closing the agreement and signing all the final agreements after the shareholder vote. And then given its software accounting, there is roughly a haircut between -- in every deal we do of 75% to 85%. And that's just based on the deferred revenues on the books at that point in time. The rest of backlogs and other contracts typically are able to be invoiced, collected and, again, reflect the commitments that are in place in the companies that we've acquired. So that's really the haircut you see. It's just the deferred revenues at that point in time. All the rest is cash due. It's revenues in the future and should contribute to the growth of the company.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So that's the big difference in terms of you would think of a subscription combination taking a massive haircut on the combined company. But based on what's there, it's only good to small haircuts. So that makes more sense. Aart, one question to you. Magma spend a lot of time and effort building out an analog platform just like yourself to compete with Cadence. As you looked at that platform, how fresh is that technology relative to Synopsys on efforts? And how important was that in the combination?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in general, we cannot comment too much of the details of the products at this point in time, but this is on the area that is highly complementary. And as I mentioned earlier, the custom area is really in need for a lot of innovation. And so I'm not worried that the capabilities that the companies offer cannot be leveraged in many different ways and, actually, are badly needed in the market, frankly.", "Operator", "Thank you, speakers. There are no further questions in the queue.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, it's almost perfect timing because it's 3:00. So thank you very much for attending this session. I understand, obviously, that with the acquisition, there are many questions, many that at this point and time we can't answer until it's close. You understand that. I also want to make sure that notwithstanding the excitement of M&A, the really big message here was that we did have a very strong '11. And most importantly, the strength manifests in itself in our ability to set more aggressive objectives for FY '12. And so without M&A, I think we're sharing a very strong outlook with you, and it's on to the next year. Thank you very much for support during FY '11, and we hope to have a further communication with you in what is now the new fiscal year. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Welcome to the Synopsys Earning Conference Call for the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Tricia. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.  Today's conference call will include commentary regarding our Q1 results and also the closing of the acquisition of Magma Design Automation, which we announced this morning. ", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results, and about the potential benefits of the combination. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-Q for the year ended October 31, 2011, our earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and our press release announcing the closing of the Magma acquisition issued this morning. ", "All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our first quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm happy to report excellent Q1 results and raised guidance for FY 2012, as well as the closing of the acquisition of Magma Design Automation, announced this morning. ", "Let me begin with the summary of our results. Our business in Q1 was strong across the board. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, including revenue of $425.5 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56. We are well on track to meeting our non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow targets for the year. ", "As a result, we're raising our outlook for the year, independent of the Magma acquisition, to a new earnings per share guidance range of $1.97 to $2.03. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. ", "Regarding Magma Design Automation, we have much work to do as the acquisition literally closed a few hours ago. We're enthusiastic about the prospects for the joint company, as the merger will allow us to accelerate delivery of technology to customers at a time of very rapid system and silicon evolution. ", "As we work through the detailed planning and integration, our priorities are the following: first and foremost, maintain complete focus on the continued success of our joint customers and their in-progress designs; second, immediate consultation with our joint customers, as we evolve and/or revise our technology and product roadmaps. We plan to take the next 90 days for this effort, which we'll communicate further details.  ", "And third, rationalize the 2 organizations. Our intent is to move quickly and diligently to optimally integrate the companies with the clear objectives of: one, customer success; two, technology acceleration; and three, continuity in delivering high-value solutions, while achieving economic efficiency. ", "Rajeev Madhavan, Magma CEO, will not join Synopsys, but has graciously agreed to be available to advise us as we transition the company. We thank him for his efforts to date towards making this merger a success. ", "Roy Jewell, Magma's President and COO, will work with Synopsys management team to ensure a successful integration. From a financial perspective and based on our initial view, we reiterate that we expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive to our 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. ", "Due to antitrust-related restrictions in effect until this morning, we have only just begun the detailed planning and integration process, and we expect to provide specific guidance related to the impact of the Magma acquisition when we report Q2 earnings in May. ", "Moving to the overall market picture. Semiconductor and systems companies are very aggressively developing and producing advanced new products, particularly in the mobile, cloud infrastructure and 'Smart Everything' market segments. The great potential of these end markets has driven a renewed emphasis on technology, visible from the rapid adoption of the 28- and 20-nanometer silicon nodes, to the focus on new transistor structures such as FinFETs, all the way to system design with an increased focus on broad verification strategies and system prototyping. ", "The EDA industry is absolutely central to enabling this wave of end market opportunities, and the fact that these are technically challenging is precisely why our industry will do well. The high level of complexity and the need for our customers to differentiate themselves are driving tremendous demand for state-of-the-art technology, product and support. All of these are fundamental assets for Synopsys, and the timely addition of the Magma strength will only augment our solutions. Which brings me to the highlights for the quarter, starting with our core EDA and manufacturing offerings. ", "In Q1, we did very well and utilization of our complete implementation solution has continued to grow. While advanced customers are now moving their major production chips to the 28-nanometer node, much of our focus is already on helping them at 20-nanometer, where we track 30 active designs. More than 2/3 of these are being done with Synopsys tools. ", "In addition, we're already enabling a substantial number of sub 20-nanometer designs. Clearly, from a silicon point of view, Moore's Law is alive and well, even if success requires great focus and sophisticated collaborations. An example of such collaboration is GLOBALFOUNDRIES, who exclusively used our newest IC Compiler-Advanced Geometry solution for its first major 20-nanometer chip. IC Compiler not only addresses the complicated challenges of managing power, performance and capacity, it tackles all the leading-edge physical obstacles inherent in very advanced designs. ", "In the area of complex mixed-signal design, rapid turnaround between analog and digital is positively impacted by our recently announced integration of IC Compiler and Custom Designer. Evaluation requests are increasing, as designers see hard evidence of significant time-to-market and performance advantages. With the move to smaller geometries, the connection to manufacturing is even more critical, both for device design and yield optimization. ", "Our key cap solution is integral to both traditional advanced designs and the new 3D transistors, or FinFETs. While being used today by nearly every leading semiconductor manufacturer, we're also seeing a number of add-on deals and new logos. ", "Our yield optimization solution is also doing very well, particularly at 28-nanometer, as yield is now clearly affected by not only manufacturing or design, but most importantly by the interaction of the 2. This is an area where Synopsys is uniquely equipped to make a positive impact. ", "The other ramification of smaller devices, of course, is more devices, and with it the continued high pressure on verification. In this area, too, we not only continue to see great technical progress, but we also saw good business growth in 2012. ", "In verification, speed is essential, and our analog and digital solutions continue to lead. Our flagship VCS product is used for 70-plus percent of advanced designs, from processors to graphics to SSEs. ", "Another positive highlight is our IP business. The trend continues unabated to outsource IP, or chip building blocks, that are very sophisticated, but may be non-differentiating for our customers. Synopsys is the leading supplier of interface, memory and analog IP blocks. With around 1,300 engineers and more than a decade of investment, we have the resources and expertise to ensure that customers can rely on the highest levels of quality, reliability and support. ", "The quarter was strong across the board for IP. For example, USB interface sales were excellent, as the market migrates to USB3.0. We expect more than 1 billion chips containing USB3.0 to ship in the next 18 months, as the protocol supports the speed needed to tackle tasks such as downloading videos. Synopsys was the first IP vendor to demonstrate USB3.0 in 28-nanometer silicon and has been consistently at the forefront of technology development. This applies to a number of other protocols as well. We expect adoption of Synopsys IP to continue to be a significant driver of growth for us this year. ", "At the systems level, we're making excellent strides with both software- and hardware-based rapid prototyping as well. Driven by the increase in complex IP blocks, including on-chip processors and graphics and DSPs, the verification tasks, especially as they relate to hardware-software interaction, are becoming central to product success. In that regard, our newly integrated virtual prototyping solution, Virtualizer, is showing great promise, with adoptions by key customers during the quarter. This is particularly encouraging, as the prototyping of the hardware is used to accelerate the software development. Thus, forming the basis for a multidimensional growth business in the future. ", "On the FPGA-based side of prototyping, we saw excellent demand for our HAPS solution in Q1, as some keystone systems companies broadened the proliferation of our boards through their organizations. ", "In summary, we're off to a very strong start for the year. We delivered better-than-expected Q1 results and are raising guidance. The customer landscape remains solid and the demand and momentum around our technology is strong across the board. With the addition of the Magma technology and technologists, we are poised to move even faster on delivering best-in-class products. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year and give you more detail on the Magma transaction. And as a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance, and we've provided reconciliations and explanations in the press release, 8-K and the financial supplement, which is posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. ", "Now Synopsys delivered a strong quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in November. Q1 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels and double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings. Today, we are also raising our full-year outlook for revenue and non-GAAP earnings, excluding Magma. ", "Let me now provide some additional details on our financials, and as a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and expenses. ", "Total revenue was $425.5 million, an increase of 17% compared to a year ago and well above our target range. Even without the impact of the extra week of approximately $26 million, revenue growth was 10%. ", "We delivered growth across all of our product groups, with particular strength from our IP and systems products. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue. ", "Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 7% of total. This is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.6 years, larger contracts averaged close to 3 years, while the duration of a number smaller contracts brought the average down slightly. We continue to expect average duration in fiscal '12 to be between 2.7 and 2.9 years. ", "Now turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $355 million, which included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $318 million, an expected year-over-year increase and well within our target range. This increase was mainly due to the extra week, approximately $16 million, and timing of quarterly expenses. Excluding the extra week, total non-GAAP costs and expenses would have declined sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the quarter. For all of FY '12, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '11 levels.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.39. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 27% to $0.56, exceeding our target range, driven primarily by stronger-than-expected top line growth and operational execution and, to a lesser extent, better-than-expected OI&E and a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate. We are raising our annual EPS guidance, reflecting our strong first quarter results and our confidence in business levels for the rest of the year, independent of Magma. ", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2012. ", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $943 million in cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter, which, of course, was prior to the Magma acquisition we closed earlier today. Of our total cash balance, 21% was onshore at the end of the quarter, and 79% was offshore. ", "As expected, there was a net operating cash outflow of $39 million in the quarter. This was due primarily to the timing of prior year annual incentive compensation payments. ", "Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. And for the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $50 million. During the quarter, we spent $40 million in cash, as part of a multi-quarter accelerated share repurchase strategy. We have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. ", "Q1 fully diluted share count declined 6.5 million year-over-year to 147.1 million, as a result of our share repurchases. We also completed one small acquisition during the quarter. ", "Continuing on with balance sheet items. Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $214 million and DSO was 46 days, reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $723 million, and we ended Q1 with approximately 6,850 employees. ", "Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some additional commentary around our acquisition of Magma. As Aart highlighted, we're pleased to have closed the acquisition today. It was an all-cash deal, valued at approximately $523 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction will ultimately be financed with existing cash and up to $400 million of debt. ", "As Aart discussed, due to the anti-trust restrictions we have not had sufficient time to gather and analyze all of the relevant information we need to provide specific guidance beyond our organic numbers. Nevertheless, we remain confident that this combination can be modestly accretive to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We will provide updated guidance when we report Q2 results in May, as we complete the detailed integration activities. ", "Now let's address our second quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes the Magma acquisition and any other future M&A. Our GAAP targets also exclude any future acquisition-related expenses that may be incurred in Q2 and beyond.", "For the second quarter of FY '12, our targets are: revenue between $412 million and $420 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $332 million and $348 million, which includes approximately $15 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $303 million and $313 million; other income and expense between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 150 million; GAAP earnings of $0.37 to $0.43 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2012 outlook, again, excluding the Magma acquisition and any other future M&A. We're raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.655 billion and $1.675 billion, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%. Other income and expense between $0 and $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 150 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.33 and $1.48, which includes the impact of approximately $62 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.97 to $2.03. We've increased both the low and high end of our guidance range by $0.04. And we're targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million. ", "So in summary, we're very pleased by our strong first quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth and continued solid operating margins. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Congratulations on closing the acquisition so quickly. I was wondering if you'd be willing to say anything about how you're looking to integrate that, specifically with respect to expense levels. Presumably, I think you'd want to keep R&D pretty well intact based on your motivation for doing the deal, and perhaps the same holds true for a lot of the field sales support. And I would think maybe G&A is an area where you would be fairly aggressive. But any color at all on -- just thoughts around how you might be thinking of expense levels going forward for Magma?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Well, in many ways, you just gave exactly the right color in the first place which is, there's obviously some efficiency to be gained by virtue of dealing with the overlap of the companies. It is also very clear that top priority for us is going to be very much the customer. And there are really 2 aspects to that, which is making sure that they are well served today and that all of their existing projects are safe. And that, of course, touches, first and foremost, the field support, but also some of the R&D forces. And secondly, the long-term, being able to take the wealth of technology that is joining our force and evolving our mutual products, or combinations thereof, going forward. We will stand away a little bit from giving too much detail, at this point in time, for a couple of reasons: a, because we are still putting together the overall business picture, and b, because, obviously, our first priority is to interact with the employees, get to know the key people and as many as possible of the whole team and, then, make decisions that are wise and also where our own employees are informed first and foremost.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Aart, so it sounds like business in general was very healthy in the quarter and you did, sounds like, beat all of your metrics. I was just wondering how you were thinking about the bigger picture for EDA. You've talked in the recent past, I think about a low single-digit type of growth rate for core EDA. Is there anything you're seeing that might make you change that opinion to the upside?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we ourselves are in the low -- actually, in the mid to mid-high right now for this year already. And I'm always a little bit careful before changing opinions too quickly on something that is, all in all, very, very stable and moves gradually. Having said that, though, I think we have told you now for a number of quarters that we see an intensifying of the pressure for our customers to really compete on the basis of very complex technologies. And this is complexity both towards smaller silicon and towards the systems area. And so I think their needs to count on EDA to make that actually possible is increasing very rapidly. Therefore, I'm not surprised that a number of the key EDA vendors are reporting good results. And I think that is very positive because it feels like there is a bit of strength in our industry at a time where we, of course, are strengthening our company even further.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, Brian, just to be clear, so your second quarter guidance does not include any contribution for Magma but, of course, will include some contribution. Do you plan to reconcile that when you report the second quarter so we can kind of understand the underlying business relative to the guidance you just gave?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, we said we would break out the guidance in our next earnings call, but it'll require 90 days or so, as you can imagine, of going through very detailed contract-by-contract analysis and getting the team ready to go and run with it. So that's effectively how we're looking at it. We'll give the guidance. It'll be included in our next guidance for the full year, as we wrap up Q2 and integrate all of the Magma elements around the revenue. The deferred revenue haircut that goes into the purchase accounting piece, the expense management and then some of the one-time costs associated with the deal structure will have to get brought in.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Understood. I was actually referring specifically to the actuals for Q2, not sort of forward-looking. But when you report Q2, will you provide us that sort of the breakout of Magma contribution in the quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, Rich, we don't know yet what the details end up looking like. But again, as you get ramped up for this, we'll -- I believe we're going to break it out for you so can see what the impact is going to be.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just to follow-up on Magma first. So can you just walk us through, in terms of the timing of the close, why you didn't necessarily have the time to give a little bit of a better look, or a least give some rough ranges as to what it might contribute for the year?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Well, we do have rough ranges, otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell you that we expect it to be accretive in the first year. But realize that in account-competitive landscape, until you pass the hurdles of government approval, you can essentially not share any knowledge about anything that could impact the competitiveness of either of the entities. And so the closure with the government was just very, very recent. And so, we decided to move right ahead with the closure, and now we will go into much more detail in understanding their business model. Now, having said that, we're not seeing any surprises. As some of you have already recognized, their business model is quite different from ours. We have communicated to you for now quite a number of years that we're in the high or in the mid-90s percentage ratable, and their business is actually quite a bit different from that. Actually, if you look at their latest 10-Q, you'd see that about half of their business is upfront. And so we will need to work through a model shift to align that with our business practices. And these things are just complex to do and will require a detailed understanding of every contract. And these contracts are actually very complex, so that takes some time. But fundamentally, we don't expect any big surprises, we just understand that the details will come together as we work through all the details, literally.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But again, just to be absolutely clear, the next time that we should hear an update on guidance including Magma will not be until the second quarter earnings call?", "Aart J. de Geus", "That is exactly what we have just said, yes.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. I just wanted to make sure. And then, Brian, when you report, is the intention -- I think we talked about this at the time of the question, but is it your intention to actually report revenue, adding back what you would have to write down for deferred revenue write-down?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, let me talk about that. The -- as we looked at the preliminary balance sheet coming over this morning from their very recently completed Q3 -- as you know, Magma would have announced tomorrow -- we have about $23 million of deferred revenue. And then, there will be approximately -- they way we've typically done it, and again, we've got to get into all the details about cost-to-implement and so on, but we'd anticipate about $18 million of that $23 million is a typical revenue haircut that will go out of the revenues over the next 12 months or so. So it's the first pass at what the impact we expect from that. So relative to how much we're going to see for the impact, I think it's about $18 million. As I look at, then, what the quarterly profile is, which we have get into and work that, it wouldn't be a big problem to say, it could have been -- it could have been higher if we identified what that would be. But it typically is a 12-month reduction in the revenues that are taken, but the specific quarter, it's, again, looking at when the anticipated revenue and delivery of the products were going to happen, and that will help give some visibility to the impact in the quarter.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Let me ask one more now and I'll get back in the queue. You can use up to $400 million of financing to finance the deal. What are your kind of factors in determining how much debt you're going to pull down to finance this? And when would you anticipate making that decision by?", "Brian M. Beattie", "We've made that already, Sterling. When we looked at -- again, looking at our cash balance, we have about $200 million in the U.S. A majority of this transaction will come out of U.S. cash. We have an upgraded credit agreement in place that we filed, up to $350 million. And one of the -- very light on covenants, but one of them is that we maintain $300 million in total for the company in cash, both onshore and offshore. So effectively, the way we see it, we'll use about $100 million of our U.S. cash to complete the transaction, which has already happened. And then the balance of, as I've said, about $400 million, is coming from the debt side of it in the U.S. And we're leaving a majority of all the cash offshore and not repatriating that. And so that debt is in place. We have both a term loan that's structured for $150 million, and then a regular line of credit, which we can pull down and put back up at any point in time. And that's the way we're going to be managing cash between now and the end of the year is just having the minimum amount of debt on hand to finance both our ongoing operations, to pay for the anticipated debt with the close, and that's already happened, and we'll just keep that balance on hand. But it will be about $400 million and then we'll be coming down.", "Operator", "And the next question, excuse me, is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar.  Looking at the broad-based strength in the first quarter, can you provide some additional commentary on what drove the strength in bookings during the quarter? Are you still seeing some customers coming back for early renewals mid-contract, like you did last year? And how should we think about how revenue flows through for the next few quarters?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay. Well, in general, what you're saying is correct. It is mostly customers that need more capabilities, more of our existing tools or that are growing more aggressively in reusing IP. And so, it is a little bit all over the map. But I wouldn't say that it's necessarily early renewal, it's more a broader renewal from the business that we've been doing. So it feels like strength across the board.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And your competitor highlighted 2 key displacements that they achieved in their digital business in 2011. I know there is historically some back and forth among competitors, but can you provide some details in relation to any shifts that you have seen at your top 10 semi customers? And any specific areas where you might be targeting share gains for the coming year?", "Aart J. de Geus", "To be honest, not really. I'm sure there are, at any point in time, many shifts one way or another throughout the customer base as people continually readjust what they use. I'm not aware that there would be any major dislocation or shift where we lose a massive market share or gaining massive market share. These things are relatively stable. I can only say that we did very well in the last quarter. And so from that perspective, I think it's more a picture of there may be individual skirmishes, but so far, we're growing just fine.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And finally, can you talk a little bit about how you see new technologies, specifically trigate devices and UV lithography. How could that impact the EDA industry in general and the timing around that?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, anything that touches the very small dimensions, first and foremost, has ramification to what we would call the manufacturing side of things. And so there lithography is certainly very pointed, so are the new transistor structures and so is, by the way, all the issues that touch the yield, which is now increasingly are due both by how design is done and how the manufacturing come together. Now some of these areas are very pointed, such as double or even triple patterning, very complex, but the good news is, our tools can support this in such a fashion that the design community does not need to know about those details, except a few specialists that tune the tools. And so we expect that, notwithstanding whatever transistors are used or whatever geometries are used, the design community will just continue to see this as an opportunity to get more transistors in lower power and in smaller area. And that is fundamentally the job of EDA, is to isolate the manufacturing from the design.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Tom Diffely with DA Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Aart, I had a couple just quick questions on the industry itself. When you look at the strength you see in core EDA, do you have a sense of what node is driving the majority of that business right now?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Absolutely. I can absolutely tell you that most of the heavy-duty production design is moving to 28-nanometer, that is where most of the spending is because those are the hard, difficult nodes, while being in production, right? So you have a combination of difficulty and volume. Now there is quite a bit of spending, as far as EDA is concerned, going into 20-nanometer, but that is really preparing the landscape for the next wave of designs. And then, really, the third bucket is all the people that design at older nodes which, by the way, does not necessarily mean that it's slouchy design, not at all. It's people that actually can squeeze an enormous amount of value out of something that's already more proven. And there, the tools are essential, but the tools also are very mature. And so we look at all 3 of these camps as being of high importance to us. But clearly, the leadership in most advanced nodes gives us the best position for the long-term future.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So is it normal to see the most EDA business in the currently ramping node then, as opposed to the next-generation node?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I would say that the -- actually, I don't -- I can't say exactly where the economics come down. My guess would be that, if you look at the 3 buckets, it's sort of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, would be a pretty good approximation.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then when you look at the memory market, in the past they haven't been huge users of EDA on a relative basis. Are there any changes at the 2X or 1X node that might require them to use more EDA going forward?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, the memory market is highly specialized because, by definition, it's sort of, excuse me, on one hand, all about the transistor. How can you maximally optimize a single memory cell? But on the other hand, increasingly, memories are very sophisticated subsystems because they have to self-correct, as invariably some of the transistors don't work when you have a very large collection of them. So the ability to put the logic around that, to make that work, requires very, very high sophistication, in timing, for example. And so we have seen that in the last few years, the memory market, as a consumer of EDA, has gradually grown and we think that there's more opportunity there.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, looking at the IP market, what's your sense, when you look at your served market inside the IP market, with memory and interface, what percent of the market do you think that is? And how much -- what percent of the market are you and how much growth is left for you in that space?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, the reason this is actually, in practice, a pretty difficult question is because what we are absorbing is really a market that has been completely internal. And as much as people say they want to do reuse, the reality is, they tend to do not that much reuse for old stuff that was designed previously, partially because nobody has time to revisit these things, partially because, let sleeping dogs lie, so to speak. If it works, it's amortized and don't touch it. For all the new generations, though, I think that picture is very different. And it's different not only because, economically, it's a much better deal to reuse commercial IP, it's also different because some of these new cores are much more difficult to design. And now you have to make a decision, if you want to use your own top designers for something that's difficult, but not differentiated, or can you use them on something that will differentiate your product. And I think we are absolutely seeing that many of the design managers are very conscious of this choice. Having said that, I think we are still far below the 50% point of outsourcing of IP and we certainly see a number of years of excellent growth there.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Brian, when you look at the tax rate of going slightly down to 25%, is that just based on geographic mix? Or is something, kind of a long-term reason for that?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, it is the geo mix, the products. It's just effectively about a 1% drop from the range we had anticipated last quarter. So it's just fine tuning with some of the way the Q1 results have come through and then the geo mix of the products.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, finally, for LAVA, at this point, there's no requirement for the report, their January quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "That's correct, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, you and I have talked about systems companies beginning to do their own IC design. I mean, some are moving, perhaps. Cisco is a good example of somebody moving the opposite way. But I'm curious if your view is similar to that of your major competitor, which is that this is a net expansion of the market rather than system companies just beginning to do what their ASIC suppliers historically did. Is this a big, material trend for you? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think it is an important trend, but not just as an expansion. It is also a trend that illustrates that the necessity of multiple companies to work well together to get an end result that works, is becoming more and more important. And let me give you a specific example that -- where we see literally systems companies working straight with foundries and design companies. It is all around the term, yield. For many, many years, yield was mostly the result of the manufacturing prowness (sic) [prowess] and cleanliness of the fab, et cetera. Well, the dimensions now are so small that the variability on physics and on small deviations in manufacturing rival the variability of timing on a chip. In other words, depending on how you design the chip, you will get different yield results on a given technology. Well this is a perfect example where technology and economics meet head on, because if one can understand that and bring these parties together, they have a chance of ramping up the yields much faster than if it's sort of throw it over the wall and hope that the other party will do the right thing. And this is, of course, particularly true, also another dimension around the systems guys, which have the challenge of not only delivering the hardware, but making sure that the hardware is ready at the same time as the software, or vice versa. And so, to me, these are all good examples of what I call systemic complexity, in contrast to scale complexity, which is just more transistors, call it Moore's Law. And systemic complexity demands for the different partners to understand enough of what the other parties are doing in order to be able to work well together. And that, in my opinion, is the key reason why a number of system companies that absolutely invested in having increasingly high competence teams within their own house.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So you -- just so I'm clear, you view that as, therefore, an expansion of the market, not just taking from one bucket and putting it to another, because it's an increased capability the systems guys need, regardless, even if they're engaged with third-parties to help do some of the ASIC-like work. Am I reading you correctly?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Absolutely. And actually, it helps EDA because the reality is, we have delivered, over many, many years, an incredible increase in technical capabilities. The very fact that it's now potentially spread among multiple users, increases our ability to get rewarded for that. And by the way, that also has the potential to increase the number of engineers that touch what we do. And I'm not even going too far here in the whole notion of the software engineers that, by definition, are quite a large number. As a matter of fact, in semiconductor companies, more than half of the engineers now are software engineers. And so I do think that it is an expansion of the space at the same time that you see an increase of the challenges of design. And it's in that context that adding the Magma team is yet another asset in technology moving us forward.", "Brian M. Beattie", "And just -- this is Brian. I just wanted to follow up on Tom's question, too, relative to the Magma revenues in the last quarter. As we said, it's not going to be reported based on the rules of the 10-Q filing requirements. So just let you know as well that as we looked at the results that are just coming in, that it looks very similar to the top line results that the company saw on the second quarter, which were released. So we just wanted to let that known. And EPS came in fairly close, a little bit light, just based on some of the one-time closing conditions and other expenses relative to the transaction that was in play. So again, we're watching the results closely and now it's into our books, as of today, moving forward. So again, no surprises, and it came through pretty straight.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, I just wanted to follow up on an early question on multiple patterning and EUV. Just wanted to clarify, did you suggest that, as the customers decide on each layer whether to do multiple patterning on EUV, or they slowly introduce EUV, that your software is able to handle that irrespective of what the final decision is? Or other way, the software basically incorporates both solutions and the customer or designer does not have to worry about what's being used?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, fundamentally I'm suggesting that, because the software that is relevant here is, of course, the place and route and the verification systems that make it possible for people to lay out chips without necessarily having to understand exactly how any form of multi-patterning occurs. Multi-patterning is very complex, from a computational point of view, and there's no way that humans could do this. And certainly not on the sizes of chips. Now EUV, I think, is going to take a little while before it really has a major impact in practice on many chips. And there we are really much more involved at the leading edge of R&D in terms of what is needed for the photolithography. But the people that should be concerned, or should not be concerned, are precisely the designers that use place and route systems where, today, we have double patterning, for example, in utilization. So none of these problems are easy but fundamentally they are solved.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then the other question on design starts on newer technology. I know that you have always tracked the design start different technology node. Going forward, are you seeing the design starts -- are you seeing a shift, from a historical perspective, that more design start is driven by mobile space relative what you saw in the historically?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Oh, no question whatsoever. I think, if you were to compare the leading edge design starts 10 years ago versus today, you'd see a world of difference because there would be such a large number of design starts coming from the mobile side of the world in sort of the most advanced node minus one. The processors will continue to drive the absolute state of the art technology because they're after raw speed and increasing the raw speed at low power. But the next nodes after that are nodes that invite a high degree of integration. And there, too, of course, speed and power trade off. But the main bulk of the companies that are going there are, today, the mobility companies. And as you know, of course, the world of computation and mobility continues to merge more and more, so I don't expect that to change all that much.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Aart, if I may, a couple of questions to start about what Magma projected for its results in the proxy filing back in December. I understand, of course, those were bare numbers, you're not beholden to them necessarily, but they had projected through their fiscal '17 some pretty considerable average growth rates, looking out to about 15%, 16% over a 5- or 6-year period for their revenues. In addition to which, they were projecting that their non-GAAP operating margins would be not dissimilar from yours, in the low- to mid-20s, even though their revenue base was quite a bit smaller. So the question is, do you think that, even with the considerable degree of overlap between your products and theirs, that those revenue projections, even if they included some market share gained by them, should, in the end, result in some net acceleration of your growth? That is to say, aside from inorganic effects, do you think that there's something in their portfolio that led them to those kinds of significant growth rates, or in their contracts, so those growth rates, that would have a net incremental effect on the combined growth rates?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, 2 comments. First, per your preamble, we do not feel beholden to their projections. We have to make our own. As mentioned earlier, our business model is different than what Magma had. And it's not for me to say which one is better, but we will continue on the business model we had. I highlighted earlier that the quarter they reported, half was upfront. The quarter that was just finished was below the expectations that certainly the market had set. Some of you had highlighted already earlier that the pressure on upfront deals was probably an indicator that it's -- that life was not quite so simple as it looked like. Be it as it may, that is not the key driver for us. The key driver for us is that, notwithstanding the economic challenges that always come with such a transition or with the company, there was also a lot of very good technology and great technologists. And as much as we will be very, very diligent in managing the transition both quickly and efficiently, our objective, clearly, is to precisely aim at the growth opportunities that come with acceleration of technology, with broadening of the need for customer support and the very things that we just discussed one or 2 questions ago, which is that there's an enormous, enormous need for what EDA has to offer today. And that is very encouraging. Meanwhile, of course, we have work through the ratable model changes. And what this also brings for us is going to be an increased broadening toward some analog capabilities. So there's a lot of really good things here, but we need work through the specifics of the numbers before we give you exact guidance.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Irrespective of the acquisition, there was a conversation before about the role of systems customers. And I'm wondering how, longer term, that might have affected your model, or is affecting your model anyway? I think it was at your analyst meeting that you spoke of your sales and support model having 3 to 4 engineering and field sales support people per sales rep, covering named accounts, for example. And I'm wondering, as the market expands, as you do more with systems-type customers and the foundries for that matter, how does that change that kind of field model and that going forward?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I don't think that it necessarily changes that model all that much. I think that we will continue to see a pressure and, therefore, potentially, opportunity in customers just wanting more and more and more support. And I think this is actually an opportunity for the EDA industry to gradually evolve a business model where the support does not just naturally come with the product, because that's economically not viable. And the reason for this desire to get more and more support is because our customers are very, very competitive with each other today. Many of the markets are very fast-moving. They tend to be a little bit more winner-takes-all. And technology is a differentiator. So I believe for the whole EDA industry, this is an opportunity to evolve the business model going forward and realize that we have a lot of value to add to this competitive landscape. Now how we get there? Just take one step at a time. But the opportunity space feels pretty good.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Figured I'd come back around and focus on the business rather than the acquisition. When you look at the contracts that you renewed, can you give us some qualitative color in terms of what you saw on the annual run rates on those renewals?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, the run rates kept going up, so that is a good sign. We saw many -- we didn't have, I think, many very, very large renewals this quarter. That statement itself, incidentally, is not all that meaningful because these things happen whenever they happen. And so we keep moving the entire customer base gradually forward. And so the business was a lot of smaller transactions this quarter and actually quite typical over Q1.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, Brian, you had talked about the timing on the expenses, given the 53-week year. Has any of that impacted on sales and marketing? It seems like you got a little bit more leverage there than what I've seen over the last couple of quarters. Was there any change in terms of timing on some advertising or marketing or any other type of items that may have benefited sales and marketing.in the quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, not really. As we said, the expenses would have been lower from Q4 to Q1 if it wasn't for the additional week. And so they're very -- just very typical accruals that are tied to the expenses that we're incurring. And running in a very normal mix. All the expense levels are on track for the full-year budgets we've established. So again a good, I think, very good positioning and lower spending in the last quarter on a year-over-year basis.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And last question, Aart, you talked about large deals, kind of 3-year average duration and shorter, smaller deals with much shorter, so it's kind of hard to roll all that together, but I'm still going to ask anyway. Your 2.6-year average contract duration, we've seen that number across industry shorten up a pretty consistently over the last 18 months. Do you think we're getting to the point of stabilization? Or do you think that can go much further on the shortening side? I understand what you've already implied in your guidance, but just from a high-level, how do you think about what customers are telling you around how long they're willing to commit to these contracts?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I wouldn't overread sort of a 0.1 change here. Our own expectation right now is still that we will do overall year between 2.7 and 2.9 years. In general, I would agree with you that, if you look at it 2 years ago, it's down a little bit. I think that is probably more a reflection of the last 2 years having been economically up-and-down and up-and-down. Greece has sort of become the symbol for economic uncertainty. But I wouldn't read too much into that beyond that. We certainly, in our shop, are not doing super-long contracts. So there's not much of 5 or 7 years. Actually, I don't think there's any. And so in that sense, I think we're sort of at the balancing point. It may go down a little bit, may go up a little bit. I'm sensing I'm meandering because I don't actually have any more value to add to this question.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Sterling, in last year the average -- in FY '11, the average was 2.7 years. And so this year with 2.7, a 2.9, with a 2.6 Q1, is still where we think average comes out. Again, all down to the specifics of which contracts and the duration by customer.", "Operator", "And at this time, I am showing we have about 5 minutes left of the allotted time. And we have a question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Brian, I was just wondering if you'd be willing to give the ratable verse upfront split in Magma's just completed quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Rich, honestly, I don't have that right in front of me. We just got the P&L's in the last day or so. So I've got the full financial's balance sheet, but we still have to do the analytics on that profile.", "Operator", "There are no other questions in queue.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in that case, let me wrap it up. Thank you very much for the time you spent with us. I think that we had not only a very strong quarter, but a very good outlook for the rest of the year. That is, of course, amended by the fact that the Magma team will now be joining us. We have a lot of work to do there, but we sense that this is actually a great addition, at exactly the right time in our markets. And we will do our best to turn this also into a strong shareholder value-creation opportunity. Thank you very much for your attention today.", "Operator", "Okay.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2012, and our earnings release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.", "All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our second quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm pleased to report excellent Q2 results, very rapid progress on the integration of Magma Design Automation and raise guidance for fiscal year 2012.", "Let me begin with a financial summary. Our business in Q2 was strong across all metrics with revenue of $433 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, which includes $0.01 of dilution from Magma that was not included in our previous guidance range. For the year, we are raising our outlook based on increased visibility and confidence and the progress made on the Magma integration to a range of $2.03 to $2.07.", "From the perspective of our long-term financial management, you may recall that in 2010, we communicated to you a high single-digit EPS growth objective based on 5 pillars: One, organic revenue growth in core EDA of low to mid-single-digits; two, double-digit organic revenue growth in IP and systems; three, continued M&A; four, efficient allocation of resources; and five, keeping share count roughly flat at approximately 150 million shares.", "Clearly, we continue to deliver against these objectives and are already well on track to achieve double-digit EPS growth again this year. We will provide 2013 guidance in our December earnings release, but I will say already now that our objective is to achieve high single-digit EPS growth for next year as well.", "For the present quarter and year, Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. Before addressing the product highlights, let me comment on the current landscape. For as the economic ups and downs are readily visible in the press on a daily basis, the electronics and semiconductor industries are racing forward from a technology point of view. While electronic consumption is staying high, the battle for share among the providers is quite intense, resulting in some consolidation and accelerated push towards the 28-nanometer production of advanced chips and substantial investments into the next generations of technology.", "For our industry, this clearly means additional pressure as we support challenged and very competitive customers. But also, a solid landscape of renewals, add-on purchases and emphasis on value selling.", "We expect that going forward, customers will rely more on EDA for improved design efficiency and product differentiation, which bodes well for our sustained growth prospects. In that sense, EDA feels healthier than it has been in a number of years.", "These analysts are particularly positive for Synopsys. For many years, we have focused on building a set of complete solutions, ranging from system design to chip implementation to manufacturing. In addition, our time-based business model, supported by a substantial multiyear backlog, lets us continually invest in R&D and support in virtually any phase of the economic cycle.", "Consequently, it's not surprising that the majority of the state-of-the-art designs are done with Synopsys tools and rely on the skills of our global support teams, which brings me to the highlights for the quarter, starting with our core EDA and manufacturing offerings.", "One of the advanced areas in which both stress and excitement are visible on a daily basis, is in the design of processors, graphics and SSE. Clearly, our customers aim to achieve highest performance at lowest power. In this area, Synopsys shines. One example is with Samsung, who completed the first-ever production tape-out of a high-speed ARM Cortex-A15 processor relying exclusively on IC Compiler and Galaxy for physical design.", "Simultaneously, the acceleration to 28-nanometer saw the number of active designs and tape-outs grow 15% to 20% this quarter. The vast majority of these use our Galaxy solution. For the even more advanced 20-nanometer node, we estimate that Synopsys is being used in about 80% of designs and tape-outs.", "In this context, links to manufacturing become even more important. Our two-pronged strategy features integrating manufacturing elements into design tools for faster and better results and developing manufacturing tools to attack the most difficult challenges at the next advanced processes.", "Our Proteus mask synthesis solution, for example, continues to gain share. During the quarter, we announced that Renesas had adopted Proteus LRC for lithography verification. Also in the quarter, we had another major manufacturer adopted Proteus for 20-nanometer.", "In parallel to implementation, verification continues to be a crucial part of the design flow with 70% plus of advanced designs from processors to graphics to SSEs being verified using Synopsys. A particular highlight for the quarter was our success in expanding our verification IP offering. We introduced groundbreaking technical advances in this area, yielding competitive wins at several large companies. For example, last week, we announced that AMD had selected Synopsys as its verification IP partner.", "Let me briefly also comment on our excellent progress in integrating Magma and working with their customers. In last 90 days since we closed, we integrated all of the teams. While keeping the critical core of technologies and technical support, we're able to recognize considerable expense synergies by eliminating overlapping infrastructure positions. We are progressing swiftly to rationalize facilities and other long-term expenses as well.", "Focusing immediately on our joint customers, our combined teams conducted very insightful face-to-face worldwide listening tours. In parallel, our R&D teams that detailed cross-training and analysis to assess where strength could be leveraged on each product line. This week, we started to roll out customized roadmaps to our customers responsive to their stated needs.", "From the start, we have been very clear that we will support the former Magma tools to make sure that our customers' projects will not be jeopardized. It is also clear that in a number of areas, there are very good technologies that will integrate with other Synopsys tools, creating even better solutions and providing interesting upgrade opportunities.", "We see some of these capabilities becoming available as soon as year end or early next year. Since the roadmap discussions have just started, it's too early to comment on the specifics, but in general, the customer interactions are going very well.", "Now to IP, where Synopsys is the second largest vendor in the world leading at interface, memory and analog IP blocks. Given the high time-to-market pressure for most consumer applications, and the enormous number of sophisticated IP blocks used in the key SSE chips, the build versus buy trade-off for IP continues to evolve to the benefit of commercial solutions.", "Q2 is another strong business quarter for our IP, and we continue to expand our portfolio both organically and through acquisition. For example, during the quarter, we acquired 10-gigabit SERDES technology from MOSAID, further expanding our high-speed service offering.", "With increased attention on the advanced technology nodes, adoption of our IP blocks for advanced 28- and 20-nanometer designs is ramping steadily. We expect Synopsys' IP to continue to be a good driver of growth for us this year.", "In systems, our SPGA-based and virtual prototyping product line are doing well also. The ability to accelerate embedded software developments by 6 to 9 months is a compelling value proposition for project managers. Given that most prototyping systems are still built in-house today, we see increased outsourcing to commercial solutions from Synopsys as the driver of growth here as well.", "Bringing IP and system solutions together, last month, we introduced the Soundwave Audio Subsystem, a complete, integrated hardware and software audio IP subsystem for system-on-chip designs. This first of its kind solution is designed to save customers years of integration and verification effort and supports popular audio standards such as Dolby, SRS and DTS.", "Overall, be it in low power design, in complex system verification or in sophisticated IP reuse, all of our products are supported by a worldwide team of experts that our customers greatly rely on for their differentiation and success.", "Before I conclude, let me briefly comment on today's announcement that Chi-Foon Chan has been appointed to join me as co-CEO. Many of you know that Chi-Foon and I have been working in this matter for over a decade, and while this is formal recognition of the success we've had in co-leading the company into his present leadership position, there are no major changes in structure or responsibilities.", "I will continue as Chairman and CEO, being the main face to Wall Street, and Chi-Foon will continue as President and co-CEO shouldering much of the operational responsibilities for the company. I'm extremely pleased that we are recognizing Chi-Foon's hard work and talent in this way. I look forward to together conceive and drive the next phase of growth of Synopsys.", "In summary, we delivered excellent Q2 results and are raising yearly guidance based on both intrinsic strength in our base business and the addition of Magma. The environment for EDA and Synopsys is robust and demand for our technology is strong. We're making rapid progress in integrating Magma and expect to deliver even better technology going forward.", "I'll now call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q3 and the full year.", "In this first quarter following our recent Magma acquisition, I will also address the related Q2 financial impacts and will outline the revenue trends of the Magma business leading into FY '13. Going forward, we will not be breaking out the impact of Magma as the company has become fully integrated. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, highlighted by strong business levels, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow.", "Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials. Total revenue was $433 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago and well above our target range. As expected, revenue contribution from Magma was modest at $14 million, primarily reflecting the standard purchase accounting haircut that was applied to deferred revenue.", "We delivered growth across all product groups, with particular strength from our core EDA platform. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue.", "Approximately 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 5% of total. Now this is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.7 years, and we expect average duration in fiscal 2012 to be about 2.8 years.", "Turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $415 million, which included $29 million of amortization of intangible assets, $21 million of stock-based compensation. We also had $31 million of acquisition-related costs that related primarily to Magma.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $332 million, an expected year-over-year increase also due mainly to our Magma acquisition. Excluding Magma, total non-GAAP costs and expenses would have declined sequentially.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter and 24% for the first half of fiscal 2012. For all of FY '12, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '11 levels by approximately 100 basis points.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.14, down from $0.53 a year ago. And recall that Q2 of FY '11 earnings included the onetime impact of a $32.8 million or $0.21 per share GAAP-only tax benefit associated with an IRS settlement for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18% to $0.53 and includes the $0.01 dilution from Magma. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter. And for modeling purposes, we continue to think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2012.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $797 million in cash and cash equivalents. We also had $250 million of debt at the end of the quarter due to the Magma acquisition. Of our total cash balance, 19% was onshore at quarter end and 81% was offshore.", "As expected, our domestic cash declined as a result of the Magma acquisition. We generated $127 million in cash from operations in the quarter, and we are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $320 million to $340 million.", "Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $9 million for the quarter. For the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $55 million. We did not spend cash to repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as always, we'll evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter, including company operations, M&A investments, repayment of debt and stock repurchases.", "So continue on with our balance sheet items. Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $236 million and DSO was 50 days, within our target range. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $736 million. We ended Q2 with approximately 7,475 employees, with more than 1/3 in lower-cost geographies. Approximately 590 of the additional employees were from our recent acquisitions, the majority coming from Magma.", "Now let's address our third quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes any future M&A, including the impact of future acquisition-related expenses on GAAP targets that may be incurred in Q3 and beyond.", "So for the third quarter of FY '12, our targets are: Revenue between $440 million and $448 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $371 million and $387 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $333 million and $343 million; other income and expense between 0 and negative $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 153 million; GAAP earnings of $0.29 to $0.34 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.49 to $0.51 per share. And we expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2012 outlook. We're raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.74 billion and $1.76 billion, reflecting underlying strength in our base Synopsys business and also the addition of Magma. At this time, we anticipate that Magma will contribute approximately $60 million for the full year.", "Other income and expense between 0 and $3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%;  Outstanding shares between 148 million and 152 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.04 and $1.16, which includes the impact of approximately $71 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.03 to $2.07; and we raised the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.05, $0.03 of that due to Magma. And our current range represents year-over-year growth of approximately 13% to 15%, exceeding our beginning-of-the-year commitment to deliver high single-digit earnings growth in FY '12.  And we are now targeting cash flow from operations of $320 million to $340 million.", "Now as I've mentioned, while we're still analyzing the business and planning for FY '13, our objective is to achieve high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. For modeling purposes, we think that a reasonable estimate for Magma revenue is just shy of about $100 million, taking into account the business model transition under Synopsys, along with the backlog profile that was acquired.", "So in summary, we're pleased with our excellent second quarter results highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation. We're also pleased to provide increased revenue, EPS and cash flow guidance for FY '12.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I'd like to extend my congratulations to Chi-Foon on his promotion. So to start out, Aart, with something referred to in your prepared remarks about 28-nanometer where there's a lot of activity and some issues with respect to yield and I guess, capacity. Can you talk to how sort of that's potentially benefiting Synopsys? Where are the opportunities there and perhaps also at below 28-nanometer at this point?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. The 28-nanometer node has been in the works for a long time, both from a technology development, as well as from a designer perspective. And I think the reality is that the 2 are coming together now all at the same time with both market opportunities, designs that are ready to go and applications that really would like to take advantage of this node. And as you pointed out correctly, there's definitely the perception of lack of capacity and maybe even some yield issues that cause a lack of capacity. Now nothing that drives capacity growth more rapidly and yield improvements more rapidly than customers that are eager to buy, but we are clearly seeing that all of the suppliers of silicon are working very hard to try to take advantage of this opportunity. Simultaneously, it's an opportunity for us because the chip design itself has influence on the quality and the yields that one can get in the implementation. And so products such as our Yields Explorer allows people to look at their design and look up to the manufacturing and identify more easily issues that could reduce yield. And therefore work more closely with a foundry rapidly to fix those. And we are definitely seeing upswing on that specifically around that node. In general, I think it's encouraging that 28-nanometer is doing well because it indicates that the wave of moving to this node is now really becoming very real from a production point of view. And of course, a few companies are already well ahead of that. But this indicates that there's a lot of, I would say, advanced, if not super advanced, chips are now migrating there, and so that demands a lot of tools, a lot of handholding, which is some pressure, but also a lot of opportunity for us.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then with respect to your discussions with customers that have -- that were both Synopsys and Magma customers, any one concern is that the degree that those customers wanted a dual-vendor strategy, now they're effectively a single vendor strategy. What can you do to prevent them from the fact that -- if you to try to prevent them from going to another vendor to sort of create a dual-vendor strategy and what -- how were those talks going?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, for starters, we don't want to prevent them from doing anything because if people really want alternatives, then they're free to do so. I think what the bringing together of the Magma technology and the Synopsys technology does is for starter actually accelerate the overall frame that we have. It makes it more solid for the coming node of 20-nanometer, which is a node that requires a large amount of technical investment and support, dedication. So in that sense, I think we are a much more and even better bet, I should say, because of combining those things. And at the same time, we have been very clear to the customers that certainly for all of their ongoing projects, we don't want to jeopardize where they're heading there, and we'll continue to support the former Magma tools. So I think the customers have a lot of choice, but the customers are also very, very focused on figuring out which solutions really work and actually try to reduce some of the application.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And finally, for Brian, can you state what the interest rate is on the debt that you took out?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes. It's effectively today at about 1.375%.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And is that a floating rate?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It does, yes. It floats on a LIBOR. We've been using 30-day LIBOR rates, and the premium on top of that, the spread is about 1.1%. So LIBOR rate now is very inexpensive. We continue to expect the rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And is it your intent to maintain that debt for some period? Or would you consider paying that off rather quickly as you generate cash and the balance of the year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, I'd say our goal is to obtain really the maximum optionality that we can with the resources that we've got. But it's a balancing item there between our operations and repaying that debt. Also, the M&A opportunities, it's still maybe in front of us and also the buyback scenario. So we look at all 4 of those areas as areas that we need to address and use the cash in the appropriate way.", "Operator", "We have a question from Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Brian, first, a question for you. Your guidance suggests, your annual guidance, that we'll see sequentially lower operating margins into Q4. I mean, there was the same trajectory pre-Magma. Can you remind me what the reason is for that? And I'm just curious if there's some residual lot of costs in there that one might expect go away as you moved into the next year? I mean, fundamentally, I guess, I'm curious how to think about margins in the next year. You mentioned high single growth -- high single-digit growth expectation. Do you think that margins ought to expand in the next year, stay about where they are? How do I think about that next?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Sure, Raj, you bet. Yes, as we look at margins, first thing we'd say is, again, we're focused on improving the efficiency and driving margin up. And we anticipate that for this year, we will be up approximately 100 basis points over the numbers that we had seen last year in 2011. Relative to the Magma costs and the margin pressure, again, we anticipated that back of the last quarter that the earnings contribution from Magma would be modest and, in fact, we came out at $0.03. So for this year, the operating margins aren't quite up to the standard as you'd anticipate from the transition costs that we have for integrating the products, and again, anticipating that to improve as we drive profitability up from Magma well into '13. And then the last point I'd say is that, again, our -- as you see us already being close to 23% to 24% operating margin, that our goal continues to be achieving the mid-20% levels over the next few years as well. So again, just recall that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it does move around a little bit based on the timing of the expenses and how things work. Recall the extra week we had in the first quarter, which happens every 5 to 6 years. And you will see a bit of movement. But overall, again, about 100 basis points improvement in 2012 over 2011, inclusive of our acquisition.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And a question, if I might, for Aart. Aart, on the IP business, you talked about a good momentum there. Can you talk briefly about sort of what the margin trajectory is there? And as you balance, I suppose, the desire for breadth in the portfolio, how do you balance that against the -- and you tell me if this is true or not, but the fact that you probably have some hit products with them, the portfolio that probably generate, I'm guessing, a lot of the disproportionate amount of the revenue, just talk a little bit about you're going to build that out over the next 12 months or so?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. Raj, I think you gave most of the answer in your question, which is, it is precisely a balancing act between growth, profitability and broadening the portfolio for the short and the broad term. And in that context, a, we are clearly seeing continued growth, the business is doing well, and we think it's an important one going forward; b, without giving specifics, I think we've commented started maybe roughly 4 to 6 quarters ago, that we were gradually improving the operating margin of that business largely because as the business becomes larger, it should become more and more profitable; and c, you saw some of the results of that overall in the results for the corporation. Brian just mentioned that this year, we will be moving up the operating margin by roughly 100 basis points. Well, that is the result of all of those things, including this business. And so I think we're well on track in every domain. Now from a broadening point of view, at any point in time, yes, some of the products are \"hot\" because when somebody needs it, their competitor needs it, and before you know it, everybody needs it. And that is, by the way, also the nature of many of those standards. But it's also true that to be evolved constantly, they constantly have to be  mapped into other technologies, and so there's actually quite a distribution of efforts over a broad portfolio. And that is actually one of the Synopsys' strength.", "Operator", "We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Brian, can you start with maybe walk us through from a high level, if you can. So you have Magma that was out there with, what, a high $30 million, almost $40 million quarterly revenue run rate. How do we think about starting there, taking the deferred revenue haircut, what the impact from the model transition might be to get us to the revenue contributions you talked about for this year and next year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, sure will, Sterling. As you know, we said that this year, the revenue contribution from Magma would be about $60 million. And that, that, on a full year basis, going into '13, would give us just slightly less than about $100 million of run rate. So first of all, it starts with a very significantly different business model. And as we look at the business and the operations of Magma, now we've had an opportunity to go through every single contract and profile those out for the years, we found a few things. Number one was that, as you know, from the last 2 quarters, that more than 50% of those revenues were taken upfront. As you can imagine, that's a significant difference from us that is this past quarter, we had about 5% of revenues that are taken upfront. So under Synopsys, we look at taking those revenues for both contracts that were signed and contracts to be signed with the Magma products to our very, very ratable model. So it's quite different. So naturally, it would have the impact of stretching out those revenues. The other thing that we saw was also the length of contracts. We had one of the contracts we acquired also went out to 2019, first quarter of our 2019 plan. So you could see that many of the contracts, as referred to in the backlog, were some in excess of 5 to 6 years. And of course, we're trying to align that again with the Synopsys model, which averaged about 2.7 years. But we'll certainly honor all of the commitments that were made in that regard. And finally, down to the backlog, looking at the very specific backlog of products and contracts that were acquired on the transition, we saw about $200 million of backlog that meets the Synopsys' standard of not having options included in them for transitions. And we've taken that backlog very specifically into account as we projected both the end of this year and well into 2013 revenue. So I'd say those are the 3 contributors to the difference from what was seen as Magma numbers from the last quarter it was reported to our detailed review of them now as we look forward.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So we can assume the ratable mix to be identical to your -- to the 90 plus going forward?", "Brian M. Beattie", "That's correct.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And that could be a transition period? Okay.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Absolutely, yes. And recall again, in the first number for this year, we had deferred revenues that were about $23 million that we acquired. And we'll lose about $12 million of that due to the standard purchase accounting haircut that's done on deferred revenues. So it has a little bit of an impact in '13, that cut kind of happens over 12 months or so. So again, pretty standard process as we look through it. But again, we told everybody last quarter, we would break out all the Magma impact through revenues, spending and earnings contribution. We've done that for the year. And then now as we said very clearly, the products, the teams, the customer accounts are all fully integrated, and we're moving forward.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then touching upon an earlier question, as we think about the expense run rate, associated to LAVA, how much of the cost synergies that you would want to capture from the deal have already been recognized? How much is still in front of us?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, I'd say, again, specifically identifying the Magma revenue or the Magma employees is really not the way the company is operating right now. We are totally integrated on an integrated product offering, integrated from a development perspective where the teams are jointly developing both a maintenance of products that were signed prior to our acquisition on February 22, as well as all the integration work to the best of all the products that are outlined earlier. So the teams are very integrated going forward. And clearly, we have goals we set for 2013 and beyond of high single-digit growth, and we know that we have to work that through. And again, that's a commitment we've already made with still 6 months to go in 2012, and we just see the teams as totally integrated. There's a last few elements that we have to address relative to some facilities that we actually moved out of this past weekend, the main headquarter facility. And that's actually a Q3 activity, but again, we're moving very, very quickly on customer integration, employee integration and facility rationalization with some very significant cuts that have been taken place already in the infrastructure groups to make all of this happen.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. One more, and I'll hop back into the queue. As I look at the $0.01 of dilution, it would seem to suggest the LAVA-related expenses are about $16 million in the quarter. But total expenses were about $23 million, $24 million. Higher than that I would have expected, meaning that there are -- looks like there's $7 million or $8 million of higher expenses in just the core Synopsys. Can you give me a sense as to when you looked at it -- where maybe expenses were a little bit towards the higher end of what you expected, was it sales marketing, was it research development? Where was the heavier spend?", "Brian M. Beattie", "You bet. The -- looking specifically at Q2 numbers, our spending was up again primarily related to the very, very strong business levels that we've seen in the first half of the year related to overachievements of those levels. We have also accrued and used Q2 as a 6-month catch-up on bearable compensation payments that are now being anticipated due to this overachievement that we've reflected both in our midpoint growing by about $85 million on the top line. And as you know, that\u2019s both $65 million or $60 million for Magma and $25 million organic growth. And so again, a lot of it came from that perspective of the business is doing very well. We did need to accrue a little bit more to take into account the 6-month catch-up on variable comp.", "Operator", "We have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 of them. Brian, just to get back on the synergy standpoint, I understand the Magma is well integrated, at what point do you think the operating margins of Magma would trend towards your corporate margins?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, it -- again, we're moving very, very quickly to bring up that newly acquired business. But again, let's put this in the context that the Magma business represents about 6% to 7% of the overall Magma -- or the overall Synopsys financial performance as measured by the revenues. And we're very quickly integrating those teams that they're doing the total development work for both product groups. The expenses reflect that. The revenues reflect that. And again, we have already made a commitment now for 2013 that we will continue with that high single-digit growth for 2013 and make sure the margins are there to do it, taking into account the momentum we had already this year, being up 100 basis points over last year and the commitment we've made to continue to drive our margins to the mid-20s.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it, all right, and then I have a question for Aart. In all the last several quarters, you've seen many of the foundries and the chipmakers try to the 28-nanometer. In a scenario like that, did you actually see EDA spending stall out because customers are trying to fix the manufacturing issue? Or it was agnostic to what is happening in the factory? And secondly, if that is the scenario, do you expect a similar trend to 20-nanometer?", "Aart J. de Geus", "So we saw none of that. As a matter of fact, I think design is mostly driven by the complexity of design. And if there are yield issues, on any node, some people will spend some more money on the interface between design and manufacturing. Other people will rush to immediately remap their designs to either another node or another foundry if they can. And so I could not say, at all, that any yield issues, which, by the way, are common for every node in history, so I wouldn't overdramatize it either. But I don't think it has any negative impact on design. I think maybe on the positive side, the very fact that there's so many designs queued up for 28-nanometer tells us that there's a lot of very sophisticated chips in the works. And we certainly feel that through the perspective of our field support because they are very, very central to the success of these chip designs. And so in that context, I think that technology is racing forward as fast as it has been in the past, and the value is certainly very high because the competitiveness among our customers is very high right now.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Did you guys give what -- I mean, what's your breakout? What part of your revenue comes from 20-nanometer design today?", "Aart J. de Geus", "We actually don't break it out for a simple reason, which is our most advanced tools that are used for 20-nanometer, for example, are actually also bringing substantial benefits to 28- and 40-nanometer because they are faster. They're better. They're more optimized for low-power design and so on. And so in EDA, there's been a bit of a myth for years that every time there's a new node, people are going to change all their tools. I would say it's absolutely the opposite. People hate to change tools because these are very, very sophisticated programs. You learn how to use them, and so they upgrade if there is value to the next release, and it is true that advanced nodes tend to need the new release. But in general, I would not say that is a massive shift of tools because of a node transition.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Aart, I'd like to ask first about the Magma integration, of course. With respect to your sales and support model, the base business previously had a model where Synopsys would have about 3 or 4 AEs and field support per sales rep. And you also had,  if I recall correctly, about 150 named accounts. With the integration of Magma, could you talk about how that might have changed in terms of the scope or ratios within your sales and support model?", "Aart J. de Geus", "It's a good question. I had to think a little bit because we certainly did not do the math that way. It's not a bad way to do the math. But in general, I would say that we kept the vast, vast majority of the technical people, and certainly, of the support people because there's such a high demand but only to support the previous Magma tools. But in general, for really good talent in the field as customers tackle more difficult designs. It is also true that we probably cut higher percentage in the sales team. But again, to put in perspective, we're talking about a very small company compared to the rest of Synopsys. And, but it still adds to your point, which is if you look at the last 5 years, my guess is that we have increased the number of support people per sales person largely because the sales activity, our team activities, anyway, with the business units and with others in the company. And whereas the support is something of which there's never enough of. And so I would say that balance has increased towards having more support people per sales person.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. With respect to the products or the forces of growth actually, with Magma, you now have majority shares implementation. You reinforced what was already probably majority of share in sign-off. And as you pointed out, you're #2 in IP. Could you talk about other areas where you might look to gain significant share or otherwise just your good enough organic growth that might have a material impact on run rates and revenues?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, as you know, we have a very broad portfolio, and I even hesitate to call the number of products because there's some very large products and of course, we have thousands of little IP products. But the reality is, to cover a broad set of designs, we need to have flows that are very complex and that have many different tools. So in that context, the first thing that Magma adds, and that was one of the key reasons to move ahead, is it adds even more technology and also more technologists and support people that are very capable to our team. And so we absolutely foresee that we will continue to invest in all the areas that you mentioned. At the same time, we have another set of tools that you didn't mention in the whole verification space, in the custom space, in the system space and, of course, in the IP space. And then, even within manufacturing, we are broadening somewhat. And although it is a really small addition, it's still noteworthy to mention that this past quarter, we added this small company in the Optical space, thus getting a little bit more footprint there as well. This is all maybe a long diatribe to clarify that there's no end to need for more technology and therefore, for opportunities for us. And in that context, it's both a quest for driving the best technology, the most advanced ones, but also integrating them really well and supporting them well. And so that is the, really the comprehensive picture that we're trying to drive forward for our customers.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. Just one more for you, Aart, and then a financial follow-up for Brian. How would you rate this integration, thus far, versus Avanti a decade or so ago, particularly the area of key employee retention in R&D, for example? And how are you doing in keeping key LAVA people on the FineSim and Tekton teams and so forth?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in general, every acquisition is different in nature. At the same time, hopefully, over our history, we learned lessons, given that we done, I don't know, 60 or 70 of them by now. And in this case, if there's one thing maybe that stands out in our own execution is that we have moved very, very rapidly. The sheer fact that in 30 days, we had decided on all the people situations. In 60 days, we had already feedback from customers systematically. And now, 90 days later, we're already back on the road with the roadmaps going forward, I think, illustrates that we're moving quickly. I don't know the exact numbers actually, but of the 750 or so people, we must have retained roughly 500, 480 or so. And so I'm sure there will be some ups and downs around that, but the fact is we have some really, really good people that are here, and some have communicated that they really like to be here. I'm sure some will rethink it, but the bottom line is we're moving very fast. And I think there's some experience in the company on how to do it well. And it can all be summarized in one sentence, which is, \"Do whatever is best for the customer in the long term, and then the rest will find its way.\"", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And lastly, for Brian, you said that you had gone through the -- the LAVA backlog and contracts and, of course, changed the model. Could you talk about the degree to which you adhere to put all to LAVA's previously given bookings expectations? They have been public in giving some  expectations for their bookings. Could you just talk about whether or not you haircutted those numbers at all? And with respect to your own internal increase in revenue, that $25 million you mentioned to yourself, if you gross that up to your bookings performance, would it be fair to say that you had roughly 100 million or more in bookings upside versus what you had set you would get to get to the prior revenue guidance?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Jay, this is Aart. Let me answer this one. For starters, as you know, we don't comment about our own bookings, and so we wouldn't comment about Magma's bookings either. Secondly, there was a lot of speak that the Magma business model was virtually the same as Synopsys. It is not anywhere close the same of Synopsys. And therefore, comparing their bookings practices to ours is not helpful driving the future. Everything we do right now is under exactly the practices that we've had in the past that you have heard from us about in the past. And I'm not saying theirs were better or worse or different -- or I'm saying they are different actually. And so we are just aligning it as if these were now Synopsys' products going forward, and so they follow exactly that same strategy. But clearly, we have reworked the backlog we received that came out quite different than the way they would have reported it. And hopefully, all the numbers that you get from us now are vetted through the practices that you have seen us have for a decade or so.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Sterling Auty.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple more. First, Aart, let's talk a little bit about the co-CEO. Just to answer the question because I'm sure there's going to be some discussion. Is this the first step in the transition for yourself out of the CEO position and onto something else? I know you mentioned that nothing's changing from an organizational perspective. But I still expect people to ask the question.", "Aart J. de Geus", "It's a completely legitimate question, so I can answer it head on. No, it is not a change in status or planning of change of status for me. On the contrary, it is actually both maybe a recognition and a highlighting of what has been a fabulously good working relationship. But even better than that, I think it is also the signing up for now really working on the next phase of growth of the company. And this is a particularly good time because I think we had very good results. We have actually very, very solid outlook for this year. And so our energy is entirely focused on '13, '14 and '15, and what better time to make these changes as now as we are working together as a team. One more comment, we also have a much larger company today than half a decade or 1 decade ago. And that includes, also from a geographical point of view, and the very fact that we can both speak with full authority for the company to very different geographical locations is actually a very good thing. And I don't think we ever question what the other says. It works very well as a team.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Brian, the jump in shares for EPS calculation in the quarter, was there anything more than just the higher stock price impacting your Treasury method?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, plus the fact that given a significant acquisition that our primary focus was on that acquisition, putting the debt structure in place to complete the transaction,  and given that, we did not buy back any stock in the second quarter, combined with a higher price point that you mentioned. But overall, for the year, we look at relatively flat share count compared to where it was last year. And we'll continue to evaluate all the other options going forward.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And lastly, when you look at the gross margin, it came in very nicely for the quarter. How much of that was just a mix issue in terms of revenue versus any other items that may have been benefacted it?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well on a gross level, primarily what you see there is some of the services to deliver in the field. There's really nothing fundamental to it. Sometimes, there's a little bit of a hardware mix for our little hardware business that we've got. So really no fundamental shifts at gross levels and on the operating level. I think we've covered that earlier. That's really our prime focus.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. Please continue.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well at this point in time, I thank you very much for attending the meeting. Hopefully, you took away that not only did we have an excellent quarter, but we have a very strong outlook for the year, are focusing very much already on the further out future, and our sense is that our industry and our position is quite healthy. So in the context of many of the other moving parts in the world, hopefully, we are a beacon of stability and worthy of your interest. Thank you very much for your interest.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm pleased to report excellent Q3 results, an increase in non-GAAP earnings and cash flow guidance for the full year, an excellent progress on our product roadmap and acquisitions integration. Let me begin with the summary of our results.", "Our business in Q3 was strong, with revenue of $444 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 and excellent operating cash flow. For the year, we are raising the mid-point of our non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.05 to a range of $2.09 to $2.11. We're also raising our operating cash flow outlook to approximately $450 million, and we reiterate our target of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for 2013. Brian will provide more financial detail for the current quarter and year in just a moment.", "Let me briefly comment on the current landscape. Looking at our overall business, we see our customers continued to drive design as aggressively as they can. Even in the context of an uncertain economy, they are focused on accelerating the innovation required to stay competitive. In this context, EDA and IP are increasing in importance, enabling designers to achieve the necessary power, performance and cost specs of each wave of new products within the tight schedules dictated by challenging end markets.", "Synopsys is at the forefront of this design wave. Our financial strength has enabled us to invest in innovation and global support consistently over many years. Our technically deep and complete solutions are hard to beat in benchmarks, and our corporate stability makes us an ideal partner in any phase of the business cycle. So regardless of fluctuations in the overall economy, we expect Synopsys to continue to do very well.", "From the perspective of our customers, we continue to see rapid migration to ever more advanced technology nodes, an area in which Synopsys is particularly well qualified. Migration to the very advanced 20-nanometer node is progressing rapidly as we now track approximately 80 active 20-nanometer designs. We're also supporting intense efforts in the development of FinFETs, which are the fundamentally new vertical transistors that are needed to keep Moore's Law on track.", "Here, Synopsys is at the forefront through our TCAD offering, which is used to do 3-dimensional simulations of these new devices. Our latest IC Validator physical verification solution also supports emerging FinFET requirements and is already demonstrating success with customers. Leading-edge customers such as Samsung and STMicroelectronics have been taping out 20-nanometer designs using our solutions for more than 2 years now. At this summer's Design Automation Conference, ST, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Samsung and Oracle highlighted remarkable 20-nanometer design successes using IC Compiler.", "Moving to 28- and 32-nanometers, which we consider the mainstream leading-edge node, we're seeing rapidly broadening adoption. While the designs are complex, the design rules are now stable, and recent yield progress has improved the availability of manufacturing capacity. Approximately 80% of 20- and 28-nanometer designs use Synopsys physical design and approximately 70% use Synopsys verification.", "To achieve this, 20-nanometer alignment with foundries and with ecosystem partners such as ARM, GLOBALFOUNDRIES and Samsung are vital. At DAC, these 3 partners described our excellent collaboration with Synopsys as essential to help mutual customers address leading-edge challenges.", "In Q3, Samsung announced qualification of Synopsys Galaxy Design Platform for their 20-nanometer processes, and TSMC announced Phase I Certification of Galaxy for their 20-nanometer. I should add that, although less in the limelight, 45- and 65-nanometer design can be very challenging as well. While the technology is clearly well proven, and our tools have been honed over thousands of designs, our customers still push for maximum functionality and performance and minimum power and cost.", "It's interesting to note that many of our tool innovations, aimed at the advanced nodes, also greatly benefit the more mainstream technologies and thus, directly improve the economics of our customers in those nodes.", "Let me now give a brief update on the integration of Magma, the acquisition which closed in February. As we had planned, within 30 days, we have fully integrated our teams, retaining the great majority of their technologists. 30 days later, we have completed our listening tour of the key customers. And our 30 days after that, we shared roadmaps with those customers.", "Overall, the response has been very positive as customers saw us, first and foremost, support their existing designs. Secondly, build on those Magma tools that they thought were strong. And third, immediately begin accelerating the joint long-term roadmaps.", "With this enhanced confidence, we've seen a number of customers migrate to Synopsys faster than originally anticipated. A key part of that roadmap is analog/mixed-signal, an area with particular strength for us in verification and opportunity in custom design.", "In verification, the addition of Magma's FineSim solution, which had especially good success in memory companies, has been very well received by the broader Synopsys customer base. In custom design, we continue to build a more and more differentiated solution and have seen the number of tape outs with Custom Designer continue to grow.", "To further accelerate innovation in this area, we recently acquired Ciranova and announced a definitive agreement to acquire SpringSoft. In addition to some excellent shape-based routing and optimization technology from Magma, Ciranova brings strong placement and a number of other key pieces.", "SpringSoft, which is the world's second-largest provider of custom design tools, contributes not only great products but also an expanded geographic reach. Headquartered in Taiwan, SpringSoft broadens our analog/mixed-signal product offering, while strengthening our position in the growing Asia Pacific market. SpringSoft is also the technology leader in functional debug tools, which are increasingly critical for complex designs. Their tools are frequently paired with our simulation solution and are perfectly complementary to our offering. Here again, we expect the acquisition to accelerate our future roadmaps and drive good business growth in an area of great customer need.", "To round out the SpringSoft comments, we are currently executing tender offer and Taiwan regulatory approval processes, which can take several months. We will then move to SpringSoft shareholder approval. We expect the transition to close in our fiscal -- in our first fiscal quarter and anticipate the SpringSoft addition to be slightly accretive to 2013 non-GAAP EPS.", "Now let me turn to IP and systems, both of which are growing in importance and essential to meeting schedules on complex products. Similar to our core tools for business, we have been systematically investing in both areas for many years.", "In IP, we have built a large lead in terms of portfolio of titles, reliability and quality and customer commitment to us. Today, we are second only to our business partner, ARM, and our focus is to be the leading provider of connectivity, analog and memory IP. IP revenue grew nicely again this quarter, and we saw continued momentum with numerous customer wins in PCI Express, USB3.0 and memory compilers, among others.", "In systems, to complement our historically strong presence in the mobile market, we are methodically expanding our reach in the automotive market with virtual prototyping. Recall that prototyping can accelerate embedded software development by 6 to 12 months, and was nearly 100 million lines of code in today's premium cars, virtual prototyping is a must use technology.", "Consequently, we are seeing good momentum in the automotive space with companies such as Renesas and Infineon, further adopting Virtualizer to enable their customers to develop software earlier. During Q3, we also launched the industry's first hybrid prototyping solution, which seamlessly integrates software-based virtual prototyping and FPGA-based prototyping approaches. Even at this early stage, we are already seeing strong and growing customer interest.", "In conclusion, we delivered excellent Q3 revenue, earnings and cash flow. As a result, we are raising cash flow and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. The EDA and IP industries are doing well. And Synopsys, in particular, is executing on all fronts with strong demand for our technology across the board. Looking forward, we remain committed to deliver continued solid growth and profitability in the years to come.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q4 and the full year and provide some financial details of the SpringSoft transaction. As a reminder, we will not be breaking out the impact of Magma as the company is now deeply integrated. In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Now Synopsys delivered a great quarter, highlighted by strong business levels, increased run rate, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation.", "Total revenue was $444 million, an increase of 15% compared to a year ago and within our target range. We delivered growth across all product groups with particular strength in IP and systems. Greater than 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of third quarter revenue.", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.5 years. We continue to expect average duration in fiscal 2012 to be about 2.8 years, which is very similar to last year.", "Now turning to expenses. Total GAAP, cost and expenses were $380 million, which included $26 million of amortization of intangible assets, $17 million of stock-based compensation and $3.7 million of acquisition-related costs.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $335 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases of headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions, but at the low end of our guidance range. This was driven primarily by timing of expenses, such as some hiring and other expenses that shifted out of Q3 into Q4.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5% for the quarter and about 24% for the first 3 quarters of the year. For all of FY '12, we are still on track to expand non-GAAP operating margin by more than 100 basis points over FY '11 levels.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.50. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.55, above our target range.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remained strong with $964 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of our total cash balance, 22% was onshore at quarter end and 78% was offshore. We paid back the outstanding $100 million of our revolving debt, along with $7.5 million of our term loan, leaving only the $142.5 million term loan outstanding. Additionally, we made 2 small acquisitions during the quarter.", "We generated $296 million in cash from operations, including an expected payment from a large customer in the quarter. We are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to approximately $450 million to reflect increased collections, driven primarily by strong business levels.", "DSOs declined 10 days sequentially to 40 days, and we ended Q3 with approximately 7,525 employees with about 1/3 at low-cost geographies.", "Before moving onto guidance, let me provide some of the financial details of the SpringSoft transaction. The value of the transaction is expected to be approximately $305 million, net of cash acquired or USD 1.90 per SpringSoft share, which we intend to fund with our existing offshore cash.", "Subject to the terms of the tender offer agreement, Taiwan regulatory approvals and other customer closing conditions, we expect the transaction to close in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Now in Taiwan, this is a 2-step process. Step 1 is the tender offer. Step 2 is the subsequent shareholder vote. If 51% of the SpringSoft shares are tendered during the tender offer, our Q4 2012 financials will include our portion of SpringSoft's net income as of October 3 at the earliest and November 3 at the latest.", "We do not expect the consolidated numbers to be material and have not included that impact in our guidance. We continue to expect the combinations, once closed, to be slightly accretive to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share. However, until the transaction is closed, we have limited ability to comment on our specific plans going forward.", "Now let's address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes the impact of SpringSoft and any other future acquisitions on the targets.", "For the first -- for the fourth quarter of FY '12, our targets are revenue between $440 million and $448 million. Total GAAP cost and expense is between $387 million and $403 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense.", "Total non-GAAP cost and expense is between $345 million and $355 million. Other income and expense between 0 and a negative $2 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 150 million and 154 million. GAAP earnings of $0.22 to $0.28 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 to $0.48 per share. And we expect that greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue will come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2012 outlook. Revenue between $1.742 billion and $1.75 billion. Other income and expenses between $1 million and 3 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 148 million and 152 million. GAAP earnings per share between $1.25 and $1.31, which includes the impact of approximately $72 million in stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.09 to $2.11, and we are raising our guidance range by $0.05 to reflect our Q3 overachievement. Capital expenditures of approximately $55 million, and we're now targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.", "So as Aart mentioned, we're also reiterating our objective of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth in FY '13, even when factoring in the extra week that contributed $0.05 in FY '12.", "In summary, we're pleased with our excellent third quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First, we'll go from the line of Richard Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on the revenue guidance. Small change, but you did bring that down a little bit at the mid-point. Anything you can ascribe to that change?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I don't think there's so much meaning to that. We managed for the year, and so if you look at the overall numbers for the year -- I forgot the exact number, but we must be growing about 14% or so. And so everything else sort of falls in place gradually during year as the reality of transactions get executed. And it's all -- as far as I recall within the same range that we had before.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And nothing like, perhaps, related to Magma being different than expected or anything specific?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Oh, I think Magma and all of our own business is always a bit different than expected. The -- I'm, frankly, always a little bit baffled at the number of digits that we have in accuracy in giving guidance a year ahead of time. And so -- but in general, the picture actually is very, very solid. And actually, we're executing quite well with Magma. As said, the companies have been completely integrated. And so how all of these arrangements with customers actually play out over time is actually very difficult to predict exactly. But fundamentally, I think, no, there's no change to the business picture.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Fair enough. Just with respect to business levels, which seems to be your sort of terms for bookings, you had apparently very strong business levels in the first half. And then that seem to be reflected in higher-than-expected sales and marketing expense. This quarter, sales and marketing was actually better than we had modeled at least. I'm not sure if that actually is reflecting maybe less strong core business levels. So I'm just wondering if you could say anything about the sort of the bookings or business level [indiscernible] ranks as you've moved through the year?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes -- by the way, and I can see why that would be slightly confusing. But when I said business levels, really, what I always think of is really how's the run rate of the business developing because we're certainly very clear that high or low orders can be significant or completely insignificant. It's all a function of how they roll out in the backlog over time. And so in this case, actually, the combination of both orders and run rate were positive. And so I didn't mean to obfuscate things. It's just a general term for actually business feeling good.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Rich, just to add some clarity around -- we did have a very good quarter, as you could see from cash collections, and it allowed us to raise our cash forecast for the year. And it does relate to a number of those elements, just saying that the business is coming in stronger. The payment terms that we typically see actually were also more favorable relative to the amount of cash collected in the first year of the roughly 2.8-year deals. And we're also seeing lower disbursements as well. So all that contributed to good cash flow in the quarter and our ability to raise, fairly significantly, our cash flow for the year. And then the last thing is, again, we always highlighted, it does move quite a bit. It's tough to forecast and track our EBITDA numbers over time. So we're again happy with the output on cash flow for this year.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Understood. And just one final one, if I could, with respect to SpringSoft. You noted that the DeBussy debug stuff is sort of perfectly complementary, which is great. I agree there. Obviously, the Laker stuff would appear to be somewhat overlapping with your current Custom Designer offering. I'm just wondering how you think about those 2. Do you look to integrate Laker with IC Compiler as you have with Custom Designer? Do you think those 2 sort of sit side by side, or how they -- how you think they play out?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, this is a little bit always to the dilemma commenting before one actually has closed and most importantly, really have the teams work together on this. And so I can't really make many comments about this. But I can tell you one thing, which is what we do is, we try to take the best people that we have from -- on the acquisitions. And in this context, actually multiple acquisitions that play together, and ask them the question, what's the best thing for the customer today meaning to make sure that they fair well, and what's the best thing for the customer 2 years from now? And then you have to build a bridge trajectory. And having just done that with the Magma tools, I think we are well versed in that. And there may be some overlap, but I think there's a lot of complementary capabilities and strengths. And so I don't foresee any big problems there.", "Operator", "Next, we will hear from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups on a couple of things Rich was talking about. Brian, on SpringSoft, I know there's not much you can talk about vis-\u00e0-vis integration, et cetera. But I'm curious if you can comment on the model that they were running and whether or not you're going to need to twist that model towards a much more ratable model like you're currently operating in, whether or not that's likely to be dilutive at the beginning of the year, admittedly, if you've talked about accretion for the full year, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what kind of model they were operating?", "Brian M. Beattie", "You bet, Raj, yes. They are expected to be slightly accretive, as I said, for all of FY '13. Of course, what will happen is that we will take their business model, which was more upfront, again under their local accounting standards and so on, that's all totally appropriate. And they're looking at how we then would go through on a contract-by-contract basis, just as we did with Magma. And then reprofile -- excuse me, we'll reprofile that revenue under the Synopsys business model, which has that 90% minimum ratability curve to it. And then we'll extend that again out over time. Their deferred revenues at the last financial statements were not very significant, with a little bit more revenue being taken upfront. And again, we'll go back and when we get into the details of the contract, break out the deferred revenues, apply the appropriate revenue haircut and purchase accounting and then integrate that. And again, our intent would be on the next earnings call, where we would give a guidance for 2013, that we could identify more of the details, only if the transaction closes by that time. If it doesn't, we'll give you an update at the end of the first quarter when we expect all of it to be fully complete.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. A couple of other follow-ups, if I might. You pointed to increase in cash flow guidance rather substantive. Deferred revenues also jumped materially. How much of that is just the payments off a renewal from one of your biggest customers? Is that the majority of what drove those increases, or is it broader than that?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It's specifically to each third quarter. We have a significant customer with an annual payment that does come through. So you've seen over a number of years now quite a nice growth in the deferred revenue accounts. And that is reflected again in this third quarter, as we expected. And again, anything relative to backlog and other things, we'll give you more details at our year-end call, as we typically do. Overall, just the message being very strong, broad-based growth and strength in our business levels and have to be able to pass that through in terms of increased earnings per share guidance for '12.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right. When you guided cash flow last quarter, did you presume the payment from that large customer as you usually see in Q3, or do you sort of wait till you get it to guide for it?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No, it's fortunately very tightly tracked and aligned and very tight payment schedules against that. So no surprises; exactly as expected. And we factored in the growth in cash flow guidance from last quarter was related to the strong business levels, better terms and conditions and lower disbursements, as our expenses are coming in lighter for the year.", "Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "That's great. Last one for me. It looks like maintenance -- your service maintenance line popped sequentially, looks like it's probably maintenance. What's going on there?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, actually, maintenance in itself does not move a lot for us. It's fairly consistent. The delta from our prior quarters is in the service piece, which is what we call business unit consulting, which does tie into either milestone-based revenues or percentage of completion revenues. And in Q3, there was a number of specific deliverables in our IP and systems group that contributed to that growth in the quarter.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First, you mentioned that you had the typical customer just over 10% of revenue. But can you comment did you have any deals that were over 10% of bookings in the quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Now we wouldn't give you the details of the bookings activity. Recall, that we'll provide the amount of 3-year backlog at the end of each year. We track the revenues, of course, and go through contributors. We address the fact that we had nice run rate growth in the deals we did sign during the quarter. And again, anticipating very strong business levels through the second half to generate that ability, again, as last quarter as we're doing today, reiterating high single-digit EPS growth for '13.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Can you add a little bit more color? You've mentioned on several quarters in a row the idea of run rates, better business levels. But there hasn't really been any kind of quantification behind it. Can you just put a little meat on that in terms of what you're seeing maybe on renewal run rates compared to the last contract, or something else that can quantify that we can kind of get a handle on?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, it is actually quite difficult to quantify because it's always a little bit hidden in between the organic growth that we have, and of course, the M&A that we're doing. And you could say, \"Well, why don't you segregate the M&A out?\" But from an operational point of view, we are mostly doing exactly the opposite, which is as quickly as possible integrate the acquisitions. And so at the end of the day, the only metric that passes the -- the sniff test of time is the revenue over time, which you can see growing this year at about 14%. And I think we did better than we had planned last year as well. And while we're not really commenting about revenue yet, we have said that we expect to be on the same plan of commitments as last year in terms of the earnings per share growth. And so fundamentally, I think we're managing a very stable, well-growing business right now that is in a phase that is quite solid.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, I think that's fair. And along the lines of the treatment of the M&A, I guess we understand in terms of the integration. And I frankly think, strategically, Magma was a great deal. But do you and the board have a measuring stick in mind in terms of financially, how you'll measure the Magma acquisition success, either at a one year or some point in the future, either an IRR or something else that you can share with us?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we won't share the actual numbers with you. But the fact is we do have a great number of these metrics. And I'll be the first one to say that they are very important to work through prior to an acquisition and look at to what extent they were roughly right afterwards. But I'll be also the first one to say that they are often not as meaningful as one would want to because the very nature of success is for these metrics to disappear and become part of the Synopsys overall metric. And therein lies the challenge and having been on other boards, I see the problem in many of these situations where you really would like to track for the next 5 years if it was a great decision. And the reality is, they're part of the family and the products are integrated and one builds on it in different ways. And so at the end of the day, it ends up being executive judgments to see which ones were well done and well not. Now just to give a little bit more color, we do look back on the acquisitions, and there's always the test of fire, which is, would you do it again? And would you do it again differently? And would you not do it at all? And in the very, very majority, we never arrive at the question, we'd not do it at all, but we use each one of those look backs, which we do periodically as a way to learn and how to do it better going forward.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. And last question around SpringSoft. You mentioned using offshore cash. Is there any tax implications? In other words, do you have enough cash in that jurisdictions, or is there going to be some either transfer payments or other things that we should think about in terms of how we're considering your cash flow as you close that deal?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, I would say that there would be a minimal tax impact on the transfer. The major jurisdiction is the U.S. versus offshore, if you like. And that is where, again, a pretty significant charge if you had to bring funds back to the country. So in a way, this is an excellent use of the cash that is offshore. The fact that it's offshore allows a lot of flexibility in which country and which subsidiary it's associated with and then bringing it into Taiwan to actually close the tender offer and the full share buyouts. So minimal impact from a tax perspective since the cash is already offshore.", "Operator", "Next, we will hear from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar. Within the context of the photomask business, recently talking about some weakness in leading-edge IC design. Have you seen any signs of increased caution from your semi customers? And if not, what kind of scenario would it take for customers to really pull back on their R&D spending?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think we have seen caution for the last 2 years. And that is mostly due to the up and down of the economic picture. But interestingly enough, that caution as one aspect that tends to accelerate things, which is that people are even more conscious that if there is any economic challenge, you need to be very, very competitive. And if nothing else, I would say that the utilization of the advanced geometries and that touches certainly everything that has to do with lithography as well, has been very, very strong and very demanding. Now these new nodes tend to be actually fairly difficult to design in, and we can see that by just watching the amount of support and hand-holding required, but we can also see it by the level of interest in having tools that are ready for these advanced nodes. So interestingly enough, this is a clear situation where the overall, let me call it, caution in the global markets has had no negative impact on the R&D side of things at all, on the contrary. It may bring additional caution to the volume management side of these companies, but we have very little to do with that.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then a quick one on SpringSoft. You'd mentioned that SpringSoft is more upfront than Synopsys in terms of the Synopsys 90-10 ratable model. Is it safe to assume that SpringSoft's revenue recognition is potentially more ratable than Magma's previous split, which is around 50-50?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It's again hard to compare until we dig into the specific details because again, we're under a slightly different local Taiwan GAAP standards to U.S. GAAP standards and the treatment of that. So again, we have a good assessment internally for our due diligence work that's gone on. And again, they will be operated as 2 separate companies until the transaction is completed. And we'll be working during that period to identify each one of the contracts and profiling according to the Synopsys and the U.S. GAAP standards that we will follow. And the end result will be that those revenues will be taken -- that have not yet been taken will be taken over very ratable more than 90% ratability curve. And that will be profiled. And again, expect to give details more on the next earnings call, as we learn more of that ourselves", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just a quick one on the average length or duration of the contracts for SpringSoft. Is that something that you have available at the top of your head?", "Brian M. Beattie", "I don't, but I'll just color it by saying more upfront revenue than what we have. So again, as we get those contracts in place, we will align them, integrate them, report back to you on our new duration if that looks -- we again anticipate it will be very similar. It's all software; just as ours is predominantly software. And we'll give you the details once we integrate it.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "First, a quick clarification. The high single-digit growth next year, that's earnings growth and not revenue growth, is that correct?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Earnings growth, EPS.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. So what is your view then on just the industry growth for core EDA at this point? It sounds like across the board, things are better than they were a year ago. And I'm just curious if you've change your outlook for low- to mid-single digit?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think they are better than a year ago. And right now, we have not really changed the outlook. Remember that we were hesitant to comment about the industry, a, because there are fewer players that really matter; and b, because we're on slightly different revenue recognition models. And so it's only for ourselves, we think that this year turned out to be stronger than anticipated so when we did the planning mid last year. And at the same time, I think we're executing well, so that helps. Going forward, in -- all in all, I don't expect to see huge change. But obviously, economy does impact things a little bit. It's just not as much as for most other companies.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes, okay. And when you look at the revenue growth in the industry, are you seeing higher growth rate at the smaller companies that are moving to these advanced nodes faster than they have in the past? Or is it really the large customers that are driving the pace still?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I'm hesitant to say yes and yes. It's very individual to companies. There are some large companies that are racing like crazy. It's quite amazing actually how they do that. And then there's some small companies that see an opportunity by racing like crazy to either get acquired or to take a piece out of the height of some of the medium-sized companies. So in many ways, it's the history of advanced high-tech is in full swing here. And with that, I think we're going to see a continual changes in the industry, some positive surprises, some unexpected changes. But I would like to highlight again, there's fairly high degree of concentration on advanced technology. A lot of people betting on getting the next shift to be at the next node and being still faster, still larger and in some cases, also lower power. So that's a race that we absolutely want to participate in.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Yes, well it seems like since there's such a large investment at several foundries right now that the mid-tier fabless guy could get access to this advanced technology sooner than they would in the past. And that would...", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think, generically, that's true. At the same time, it's interesting to observe that in the last 6 months, there were innumerable stories about not being able to get sufficient access to 28-nanometer. And that was a combination of capacity not being in place, but also, the yields not being as good as people would like to have. And so why is that important to us? Well, it's important to us because not only do we have tools that help improve the yield, but we also have design techniques that create higher yield. And so it just closes again the loop that from manufacturing to design, it's really one success ecosystem. And it's to our benefit to help people be as competitive as possible.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then earlier, Aart, you talked about the 80 active designs of 20-nanometers today. How does that compare to the 28-nanometer ramp? And maybe how does that compare to just what the total design activity is at 28 today?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay. Well, to give you a comparison, rough round numbers at 28-32, we lump those things together. We have about a bit over 400 of those active designs.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then so the 80 at 20, is that kind of ramp what you've see in the past, or is it a faster ramp than you've seen in the past?", "Aart J. de Geus", "No, it's similar. There was a bit of a delay on the ramps, I would say, about 2 years ago. And you can see it on the graphs of the different nodes. But fundamentally, at least at this stage, the shapes look similar. And we certainly know that people are already chasing the next one, too. So, so far, as much as the proverbial death of Moore's Law has been predicted many times, probably including by us, right now, we're defying death and for the next 5 to 10 years, I think there's a lot of work to be done.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "That sounds good. And then, Brian, back on the cash flow. You talked about $450 million this year. In a typical year, how does that break out between onshore and offshore? I'm just kind of curious how fast you'll be able to build back up your onshore cash.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, good question, Tom. It's 50-50. It flows if you look where our revenues are split, 50 U.S., 50 outside of the U.S. The cash flow follows that profile as well. So again, relative to SpringSoft, use of offshore cash that will continue to build up there, for the U.S. side where, again, we can look at U.S. M&A, our buyback scenarios and other things, half of the cash will be attributed to the U.S., and good strong balances as well as having both debt capacities and the small amount of current debt currently on the board to really put our -- continue to put our balance sheet to work.", "Operator", "And next we'll hear from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Brian, just on the non-GAAP operating margin. You've been pretty consistent since 2008 in 23% to 24% range. Is that something we've kind of -- at a saturation level, or are you thinking anything? Is there anything that can be done there to push that beyond 24% levels?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Sure, Mahesh. You can see that in 2012, we are forecasting over 100 basis point improvement in our operating margin compared to 2011. We have said for several years that our goal is, over time, to be in the mid-20s. So just as we're delivering as we have over the past several years, we continue to push for higher operating margin levels and expect that to be in the mid-20 range.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And where do you think that most potential is? Is it revenue growth or slower cost to increase? I mean, with the M&A, as you can't keep up the cost increase, you cannot slow down the cost increase. But where do you think that level is to go to the 25%?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, it has to be both, of course. At the end of the day, no business can grow its profitability well if it doesn't grow revenue. And obviously, that's got to be our driving consideration. At the same time, the rest is really the discipline of managing your P&L. And that discipline, of course, gets sort of shocked every time we make an acquisition because, at least temporarily, you have a new family member, so to speak, with different P&L configuration. And moreover, a haircut has been applied or is being applied for the first year or so. But having said that, we clearly look at acquisitions also from a perspective of efficiency, certainly for the infrastructure, certainly for part of our field connection to the customers, be it on the sales side or be it on the support side, and even in some of the cases on the R&D side. Although if there's efficiency of the R&D side, we tend to variably use that to really accelerate other capabilities. But fundamentally, there's no reason whatsoever that acquisitions should be negative over longer period of time to our profitability. And as Brian said earlier, we have been on the track to get to mid-20s and mathematically speaking, 24% is not quite mid-20s yet.", "Brian M. Beattie", "And Mahesh -- maybe, Mahesh, also just to maybe add to that, all of the discussion on operating margins, of course, are vectored towards continued high single-digit EPS growth. I mean, we've put that number out there several years ago. We've been fortunate in the last few years to see double-digit top line and EPS growth. And again, all of the actions we take relative to driving our core business, our IP and systems business, which now, even on a trailing 12-month basis, is over $400 million, driving that on double-digit top line growth, managing our expenses, looking at M&A for continued growth and finally, holding our share count at roughly flat with the FY '12 levels, have been the ways that we have developed our plan on continued high EPS growth. So margin management is just part of that related to both revenue growth and expense management.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And to follow up, just a clarification on the cash flow commentary. I mean, you're increasing the guidance pretty significantly. But you mentioned one time that it was related to one customer coming up at the -- big payment, but that was predictable. So I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on where the higher cash flow guidance -- the significant increase in cash flow guidance is coming from?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Absolutely, yes. The first element that you referred to in the question earlier was about our large customer. And that payment was expected, and it's not contributing materially to the growth. Our prior guidance was about $320 million to $340 million. And now based on Q3 results and cash achieved, plus the outlook for our fourth quarter -- based on those stronger business levels, is one reason to show that our cash flow could increase hereby between $130 million and $110 million. The second thing was the profile of those new transactions, which we saw in Q3 and anticipated in Q4, just show that the ability to collect cash within the first year of the 3-year agreement is actually coming in better than we expected and very strong, good terms and conditions being put in place. And then remember, the third point was about the lower spending, lower disbursements and all that contributing. But again, to put it in context, we look at how that relates over time to our EBITDA less the tax -- cash taxes paid. And if you look back on the last 3 years, in '11 -- from '11, '09 and '10, our average operating cash flow is about $340 million. So we'll track that EBITDA over time. And just forecasting it of when a particular contract is signed and whether it's renewed early or renewed on time, those are all the elements we try to forecast each quarter in our outlook. And again, it's just all of it coming in much better than where we saw it a quarter ago.", "Operator", "In a moment, we'll hear from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer. [Operator Instructions] And so next, we'll hear from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Aart, 2 somewhat related questions about EDA customer activity. Historically, the EDA industry was not particularly governed by a large number of licenses installed. Even within the larger revenue categories of EDA, it's not a particularly high-volume industry. And the question is, is there anything now particularly at the newer nodes or the newer applications\u2019 requirements that might suggest that there would be some meaningful increases in the volume of licenses, not that you get paid by customer for their volume, but instead that you -- they would consume more licenses than they might have in the past. Secondly, at the DAC breakfast that you had mentioned earlier, Synopsys highlighted the fact that you have now double patterning enabled many of your tools. There was even some mention of something called triple patterning. But the question there is, are you, in fact, seeing a large usage or increased usage of those newly enabled tools, particularly since the 20-nanometer design activity has gone from the 50 that was quoted at DAC to be 80 now?", "Aart J. de Geus", "So on the licenses, I assume that you say it's a low-license market, if you compare it to, let's say, design drawing tools and things like that. Certainly, in that sense, we are relatively low license, also a much lower number of customers. However, certainly, in the last decade, we have seen a continual growth of the number of licenses. And the challenge that, as an industry, we have always faced is that customers need many more licenses but don't have many more times the budget that they have before. And so for better or for worse, the reality of that has been that they have gradually grown larger pools of licenses and gradually grown the amounts that they have spent with us. But the spending is unfortunately not proportional to the number of licenses. Now be it as it may, that is just the way this industry functions. And I'm not complaining; it's just an observation. Having said that, I think there's some areas that have seen clearly more license growth than others. And the area that immediately comes to mind is the various forms of simulation. And what you can see is that the complexity of the designs that people are dealing with, that simulation can be at the transitional level all the way to the system level. Those complexities are such that the number of potential errors is very large and growing much more rapidly than the size of the design, therefore, verification continues to grow. And so this is one of the reasons we're spending attention to that area. And I think we will see a continued license growth there. On the double patterning, yes, this is technology that is both very advanced and now very necessary. And for those that are not initiated with that term, what this is all about is that in order to get very, very small devices on a chip, instead of doing a single illumination, a flash of light, you do 2 flashes of light, or even 3, in most cases 2, therefore double patterning. And the combination of the patterns give you sharper lines, so to speak. Now you can quickly imagine that, that becomes very difficult because you're essentially doing 2 designs at the same time that are -- that become 1 design through the interaction of light rays. I've purposely made this story a little complicated because -- and you will appreciate that the tools to make this actually work are very, very sophisticated. The good news is, I think, we're very much on top of this field. We have been investing in this for at least a decade. Many acquisitions that we made in the lithography area over the years have greatly enhanced our understanding from every which way you can think about this. And so for the advanced tools, the answer is yes, this is now in utilization and is actually a point of differentiation when you can point to the fact that you have these technologies and get good timing and good power and all the other metrics of success. So the games continue to become more complex, and that, so far, plays into our hands.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. A couple of follow-ups for Brian, please. First, according to your website, you're listing close to 400 open positions globally, mostly in engineering and R&D, of course. And that number that you're showing is roughly equivalent to 5% of your current headcount. The question is does your margin guidance for the rest of the year and earnings consumption going into next year envision that you would fill most, if not all, of those positions? Then one final one on IP.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, you got it. The expenses we factored in for the rest of the year assumes some growth in the numbers, but I'd kind of take you away from those open wreck list because in there, again, you've got a number of things. One is, again, we go after very, very specific technical engineering skills around the world in terms of EDA and semiconductor technologies. And those people aren't always available. So we are constantly looking for the best people. Second thing is there are normal industry levels of attrition that go on and happens in different places around the world at different rates. And you always have to have people available to come in and join your team, just taking care of normal attrition levels that we and every other company in the industry have seen. So again, the specific heads coming in, we factor through after -- you look at a significant list of potential hires and then bring that down into specific names and numbers and when would they start, what jobs will they have and so on. All of that is factored in very clearly, into our '12 plans. And again, we're also very cognizant of '13 spending levels. And we're working through some of the internal budgeting activities between now and, of course, our next earnings call to complete the details of how we're going to deliver again high single-digit earnings growth in '13.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then lastly on IP, is there an appreciable change in the license mix in your IP and systems business? For instance, sequentially, your IP and systems business was up about $17 million from Q2, but your upfront revenue and total was up only $3 million. So I know that in the past, IP was somewhat more upfront than the software tools business, but has there been then appreciable change at all in that respect, Brian?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, Jay. What I'd highlight is that again, relative to our organic growth and number of the acquisitions in this area, that we've seen some changes in our slight business model, less upfront revenue generically. We see more revenue related to both percentage completion and milestone based, and that was the discussion of how Q3 had picked up in the service line earlier. And again, many times in terms of some of the IP activities in that, there are commitments that take place over multiple years and the revenue has to be recognized over that period as well. So again, you see very strong numbers in terms of IP and systems. Even on a trailing 12-month basis, we're up about 26% in that area. And as I mentioned, we're now over $400 million trailing 12-month revenues in that area. So we said double-digit growth and clearly, you can see the results reflecting that over the past several years.", "Operator", "Speakers, we've got about 1.5 minutes before the top of the hour, no further questions in queue.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, thank you very much for attending this earnings conference call. As said, I think we're looking back on a very strong quarter with a strong outlook for the year, which we shared with you, and also a lot of good work already in preparation for 2013.

Today, I'm happy to report that we closed an excellent Q4, achieving very strong fiscal 2012 results. We completed several important acquisitions during the year, and we're positioned well and feel momentum as we head into 2013.", "Let me begin with our results. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $454 million, resulting in $1.756 billion for the fiscal year, a 14% increase over 2011. This revenue reflects both excellent organic growth and momentum from key strategic acquisitions.", "With non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 in Q4, we delivered $2.10 for the year, 17% growth and substantially above the target range communicated at the beginning of fiscal '12. Simultaneously, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin over 100 basis points to 23.6% for the year while generating $486 million at operating cash flow. Our 3-year backlog grew to $2.7 billion, and we have approximately 80% of next year's revenue target already in hand. This provides us a high degree of stability in a difficult-to-predict economic environment.", "In summary, it was a very strong year with double-digit growth in both top and bottom line and excellent momentum into FY '13. We therefore reiterate our intent to deliver ongoing high-single-digit earnings growth and are setting our FY '13 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.26 to $2.31. Brian will provide more detail in just a minute.", "Looking forward, let me briefly comment on the customer landscape. While the overall economy is certainly filled with question marks, the semiconductor industry is racing forward through a combination of technology pushes, efficiency drives and competition as our customers vie for share in ever-changing and demanding end markets.", "While challenging in terms of both technology and support for EDA suppliers, we're observing that customers increasingly see EDA as a differentiator rather than a cost factor. This is very positive for our industry. Meanwhile, design moves forward aggressively, new technology nodes and even new transistor type are rapidly being adopted, and overall complexity demands a strong reliance on leading EDA capabilities. The heightened value of EDA bodes well for our industry. And as tool consumption and demand for new technology continues to rise, Synopsys is clearly benefiting. Our strong financial and backlog position anchors our ability for continued investment, our R&D focus continues to deliver the technology leadership needed by our customers to differentiate themselves and our recent strategic acquisitions form an excellent springboard to deliver some great next generation solutions.", "From a technology perspective, our customers count on us for 3 fundamental task sets: one, the implementation of designs in smaller and more complex technologies; two, the verification of designs of enormous size and complexity; and three, the availability of a broadening set of the most important IP cores. We have made significant progress in all 3. Let me give a bit more detail while also highlighting the impact and opportunities created by the key acquisitions we closed this year.", "Starting with the chip implementation flow, we see an unabated push for new technologies in terms of both smaller geometries and the emergence of a new type of vertical transistor called a FinFET. Looking at the now stable but still quite advanced 28-nanometer node, we find that over 90% of the tape-outs use the Synopsys Galaxy Implementation Platform. While much more design will be done in this node, the most advanced companies are now migrating to the 20-nanometer node and below technologies. This migration is done with extensive help on Synopsys' part, and we are now assisting on approximately 100 20-nanometer designs.", "Leading edge companies such as Samsung and ST have described 20-nanometer designs using our tools for more than 2 years, attesting to the early robustness and reliability of our solutions. As a result, Galaxy has been used in approximately 90% of 20-nanometer tape-outs thus far.", "Recognizing our leadership, TSMC named Synopsys a Partner of the Year for 2012 for joint delivery of the TSMC 20-nanometer reference flow, which includes the entire Galaxy Platform. In this context, it is also worthwhile to note that the acquisition of Magma brought a number of new technologies and the opportunity to strengthen several customer relationships. After first conducting and listening to our customers, we delivered technical roadmaps within 90 days of closing the acquisition. We aligned with a number of key customers to accelerate their move to more advanced nodes, and we integrated the joint R&D teams to immediately fuse the best capabilities each company had to offer. For example, in the December release of our timing tools, we are delivering substantial accelerations and new capabilities resulting in part from the combination of best-in-class algorithms. This also holds true in the analog/mixed signal space where customers are already responding to the strength of our new FastSPICE roadmap.", "The other technology drive is around FinFETs, which I mentioned are the leading new type of vertical transistor, enabling Moore's Law to continue to smaller nodes while dramatically reducing power consumption.", "After investing for many years with the technology leaders, Synopsys is far ahead an EDA FinFET enablement. The technical challenges of FinFET require new approaches in the manufacturing area. Our market-leading TCAD products are used to perform 3-dimensional simulations of these new devices, and our mask synthesis products enable foundries to perform highly advanced corrections. Our sense of collaboration with all the partners within the ecosystem, including foundries, early adopters and research institutions, has led us to deliver best-in-class technologies throughout our portfolio.", "We have developed and successfully deployed our own FinFET circuits in the form of FinFET-based embedded Memory and Logic IP, with a broad range of IP in the pipeline for 2013. Our Galaxy Platform is not only FinFET-ready, it has been extensively used for a number of successful production FinFET take-outs.", "With a continued push towards smaller devices come the benefits but also the challenges of significantly more complex chips. Nowhere this more visible than in the growing amount of verification needed, which has become not only the biggest design time consumer but often the bottleneck to completing designs period.", "Synopsys was already well placed, but the 2 acquisitions, EVE and SpringSoft, now enhance our portfolio and open the door to delivering a complete next generation verification solution. Even prior to these acquisitions, Synopsys was the clear leader in both advanced digital verification, in which 70% of advanced designs utilize Synopsys and analog simulation, where we serve approximately 80% of the market segment.", "SpringSoft brings the leading debug environment, addressing what today takes up about 35% to 50% of engineers' verification effort. With EVE, we acquired the fastest hardware emulator in a rapidly growing industry. The feedback from customers has been remarkably positive. They see Synopsys as a company that has all the pieces, from simulation to emulation to rapid prototyping to verification IP to debugging, and also the track record of delivering a much better integrated overall solution.", "Two more comments about the acquisitions. SpringSoft also brings an analog/mixed signal design solution that has broad and loyal penetration specifically in the growing Asia Pacific geography. Combining the SpringSoft product line with our existing efforts in custom tools increases our critical mass and gives us more momentum in an area where Synopsys is steadily building a market position.", "The acquisitions of EVE in France and SpringSoft in Taiwan were financed by our international cash and on top of the significant Magma acquisition, were executed and integrated very efficiently. Even more important have been the extremely positive customer reactions, and the resulting business momentum is clearly visible and very encouraging.", "The third area I would like to briefly highlight is the continued growth and breadth of our IP and Systems business. As chips contain still more transistors, the importance of commercial IP is twofold: improve designer productivity by providing a catalog of highly optimized and verified building blocks and reduce risk and effort by having these IP blocks available in the latest technology nodes when customers need them. Our portfolio of high-quality production proven IP is a clear differentiator for Synopsys as evidenced by excellent growth during the year. While the breadth of our offering continues to increase with new titles, such as the newly launched support of the emerging DDR4 memory interface standard, so does the span of silicon nodes supported, with much of our R&D efforts on migrating our cores to the 20-nanometer and 14- and 16-nanometer nodes while supporting FinFET technology.", "Customer adoption of these advanced nodes is accelerating. Today, Synopsys is the market segment leader in interface IP, embedded memories and analog IP. Our position is appreciated by our foundry partners, and TSMC also recently awarded Synopsys its 2012 Interface IP Partner of the Year for an unprecedented third year in a row.", "We're also highly complementary to the other IP providers in the processor and graphics space. Where in Q4, we announced a major agreement with ARM to broaden our collaboration through expanded access to key ARM technology and delivery of optimized implementation flows to speed time to market for our mutual customers. To give a sense of the importance and continued growth potential of our business, it's interesting to note that our DesignWare IP is shipped more than 1 billion chips per year and counting, that every 2 days, a chip is taped out using our USB. That every week, a chip tapes out with our PCI Express, and our customers have already shipped tens of millions of chips containing our 28-nanometer IP. Our objective is to continue to grow the IP business at a double-digit rate while gradually increasing profitability as we've successfully done in the last 2 years.", "In summary, against the backdrop of rapid technical semiconductor and overall economic change, Synopsys is in a very good position with both product and market momentum. Our commitment to customer and partner success is built on a foundation of excellent financial execution. Our ongoing multiyear objective is to drive annual high single digit non-GAAP earnings per share expansion. This objective, formulated a couple of years ago, has actually been substantially exceeded in the past 2 years.", "We plan to achieve our goal through a combination of the following: one, drive traditional EDA organic revenue growth generally in the mid-single-digit range; two, achieve IP and Systems organic revenue growth generally in the low double digits; three, continue to focus on operational efficiency with operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s; four, continue to explore value and TAM-expanding M&A; and five, optimizing the use of our strong cash flow with our own M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year, provide you with our 2013 guidance for Q1 and the full year and provide some financial details on the SpringSoft and EVE transactions. In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "Now, as Aart mentioned, Synopsys delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results highlighted by an increased run rate, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we significantly exceeded our original 2012 targets for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow.", "Q4 total revenue increased 16% to $454 million, and as expected, revenue contribution from SpringSoft and EVE was not material but came in at about $9 million. Annual revenue grew 14% to $1.756 billion. This, of course, includes the revenue contribution from our 2012 acquisitions, including approximately $60 million from Magma as expected. Even excluding these transactions, our organic business was quite robust.", "For the year, we delivered growth across all product groups, with particular strength in IP and Systems. Greater than 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.8 years for the quarter and about 2.7 years for all of fiscal 2012. We currently expect average duration in fiscal '13 to be about 2.7 years.", "Three-year backlog increased to $2.7 billion from $2.5 billion due to our 2012 acquisitions and also reflects a solid base book-to-bill of about 1. Finally, we have approximately 80% of our target fiscal 2013 revenues in hand for the coming year and more than 90% for the coming quarter.", "Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $415 million, which included $28 million of amortization of intangible assets, $17 million of stock-based compensation and $8 million of acquisition-related costs.", "For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.566 billion, which included $100 million of amortization of intangible assets, $71 million of stock-based compensation and $44 million of acquisition-related costs.", "Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $358 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.342 billion, an expected increase due mainly to our acquisitions, the extra fiscal week in Q1 and year-over-year cost increases such as employee compensation.", "Excluding our 2012 acquisitions, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were slightly below our original expense budget. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21% for the quarter and 23.6% for the full year. This represents an increase of more than 100 basis points over full year 2011, even as we work through the integration of a number of 2012 acquisitions. For all of FY '13, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '12 levels by an additional 100 basis points.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 for the quarter and $1.21 for the year compared to $1.47 for all of 2011. FY '12 GAAP earnings reflect $44 million or $0.30 per share of acquisition-related costs compared to $1.2 million or $0.01 per share in FY '11.", "Q4 non-GAAP expenses -- earnings per share were $0.47, and full year non-GAAP earnings grew 17% to $2.10. FY '12 earnings growth was driven primarily by top line growth, including the extra fiscal week and operational execution.", "Now turning to our cash flow, we generated $103 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $486 million for all of fiscal 2012, which exceeded our original expectations as higher business levels and better payment terms resulted in strong collections. As you recall, we also took on $250 million of debt in Q2 due to the Magma acquisition. Since then, we paid back the $100 million revolving debt along with $15 million of the term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $135 million term loan outstanding.", "We also completed several important acquisitions during the year, which enabled us to use approximately 45% of our beginning-of-year offshore cash for acquisitions. As a result, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $700 million, with 28% onshore and 72% offshore. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of at least $350 million in FY '13. And since cash flow tends to be lumpy from year-to-year, we continue to believe a fairly good indicator of operating cash flow over time is EBITDA.", "For the 3-year period ended in FY '12, our cumulative operating cash flow was $1.267 billion, just slightly more than EBITDA over that same period. And finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 due primarily to the timing of prior year's annual incentive compensation payments.", "Now DSO was 58 days, reflecting the timing of invoices. And we ended Q4 with 8,135 employees, about 1/3 in low-cost geographies. Approximately 1,120 of the 1,335 employees we added during the year were from acquisitions, with the majority coming from Magma, SpringSoft and EVE.", "Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some additional commentary around the SpringSoft and EVE transactions, which were both funded with offshore cash. On October 1, we acquired a 92% controlling interest in SpringSoft, and their results are included in our consolidated financials as of that date but were not material. We subsequently closed the full transaction on November 30. We also closed the EVE acquisition during the quarter, and as expected, the transaction did not have a material impact on our Q4 financials.", "We expect the combination of SpringSoft and EVE to contribute approximately $100 million of revenue in fiscal 2013 as we work through the SpringSoft transition to the Synopsys 90% time-based model, and we expect the 2 transactions to be slightly accretive to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share.", "Now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. As a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and total non-GAAP expenses by $25 million and $16 million respectively. For the first quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $468 million and $478 million, an approximate growth rate of 18%, excluding the extra week in 2012; total GAAP costs and expenses between $403 million and $419 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $356 million and $366 million; other income and expense between 0 and a negative $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% to 26%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 157 million; GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.35 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share and we expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now, our fiscal 2013 outlook: revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14% excluding the extra week in 2012; with the additional hardware revenue from EVE, we would expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue but continue to expect a 90% time-based revenue model in 2013; other income and expense between 0 and negative $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% to 26%; outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 to $1.46, which includes the impact of approximately $69 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.26 to $2.31, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 10%, or 10% to 13% excluding the extra week; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and we're targeting cash flow from operations of at least $350 million.", "And finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2013 quarterly expense profile. At this time, we expect Q1 expenses to be lower than the rest of the year, with quarters 2, 3 and 4 at about equal levels.", "So in summary, we're pleased with our excellent fourth quarter and full year results highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation. We enter 2013 with a unique combination of stability and growth, which positions us well in many macroeconomic scenarios.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Richard Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, just first wondering if you could comment on the environment you're seeing, if there's been any change in customer behavior, whether there's any tightening up at all as it relates to perhaps things going on in Washington or just the choppiness of semiconductor revenue as we head into '13?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think we can say that we have not seen any change whatsoever regarding EDA. We suddenly feel that customers are speaking with a little bit more caution about the end of this year and maybe the first 2 quarters next year with a little bit more hope or confidence beyond that. But that's the nature of the industry that we're in. And I would say yes, there is a tightening in terms of competitiveness, but that is really not new. And we've seen that in the last 2 to 3 years. And so the uncertainty is something that people just reflect on, that's just the situation around us. But meanwhile, they're forging ahead at high speed.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then you mentioned you had a book-to-bill of about 1 in the quarter. So in backlog, it sounds like it would've been about flat x acquisitions. Wondering if you could comment at all on revenue run rate coming out of backlog x acquisitions. Would we have seen any increase in run rate x acquisitions year-to-year as we enter '13?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, you would.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Brian, with respect to cash flow, you mentioned lumpiness. And obviously, you had significant outperformance this year, and you're guiding for, at least at this point, lower next year. Was there anything that was favorable in terms of timing for cash flow, things that maybe happened earlier than you might have thought that helped this year at the expense of next year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "I just look back to the fourth quarter, and we saw very strong cash flow as we came through into the fourth. And then we're able to overachieve the fourth quarter just based on the timing of when customers paid and looking at the profile of our disbursements. So it came in about $35 million to $40 million higher than we expected in the fourth quarter of FY '12. So naturally, you have to take that into account as you look at the expected operating cash flows for 2013. Still a very strong number though in '13, and at this point, feel being at least $350 million is a very good number.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Thomas calling for Krish. Based on FY '13 guidance, you're estimating sales growth of about 12% year-over-year compared to EPS growth of about 9% at the midpoint. How should we think about margins within this framework and the levers around margins, and whether the ongoing integration of acquisitions is baked into this full year assumption?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, it is. They're completely baked in because by the time we go into a new year, we sort of uphold the numbers as a function of whatever acquisition we did. Just be aware that meanwhile, there's a number of license transitions, maybe some haircut leftovers and things like that from the acquisitions. But overall, our objective remains the same, which is an ongoing basis deliver high-single-digit EPS growth. And that is really what we're optimizing the business for.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And so the linearity of the operating expenses, you're saying that it's probably going to remain at these relatively higher levels?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we're essentially managing a, really, multiyear business model. And so by definition, all in all, our business model is extremely stable. And so as we make gradual improvements to the ops margin, they gradually reflect themselves, obviously, in the bottom line. But the singular most important aspect is really the ongoing growth on the top line. From quarter-to-quarter, things can be lumpy and somewhat unpredictable. And certainly for me, I\u2019ve always heard that the way we reflect on the business is on sort of the rolling averages basis, which looks very solid.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And last one for me. Your IP and Systems segment show a very strong growth in FY '12, up 25% year-over-year. What outlook do you have baked in for this segment for FY '13? Is it safe to assume it's around that same level?", "Aart J. de Geus", "No. Specifically, actually we said that we were looking forward to a low-double-digit growth rate for the IP. Now that may be a little lower than the average, partially because this year or the end of the year was particularly strong. And so this is overall a very good growth business, so doing very well. Just from one year to another, it can be a little lumpy, and so we wanted to be on the conservative side and really manage as a multiyear perspective.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just want to circle up on a couple of housekeeping here. On the backlog, how much of that backlog was organic, if you can say?", "Aart J. de Geus", "It was the $200 million growth, up to $2.7 billion, was all from the acquisitions we completed during the year. And the rest of the organic business was a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year. So again, very solid in line with the revenue growth and booking that nicely.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And you said even though they're immaterial, can you give us a sense what -- I think you mentioned the revenue on one of the acquisitions, but what was the revenue and, just as important, the expense contribution for the quarter from the acquisition?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, the revenue impact from the 2 acquisitions that were closed in October were approximately $9 million. The expenses were about the same level. So again, it was not a material impact to EPS during the quarter just in view of the integration work that was ongoing and transition to a new business model and so on.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And I heard the comments on cash flow, but I'm curious, it looks like there was a spike in accounts receivable here. Again, the DSOs were up in the 50s. Was that from acquisition contribution or what else is happening on the AR side?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, it's -- AR is in very good shape. It just reflects the profile, the timing of our billings out at end of the year. Our fourth quarter was very strong, and as a result of invoicing at the end of the year, during the month of October, those collections just didn't come in. So you see us typically running kind of a mid-30s type of DSO levels. And just for this particular, given the business was so strong and the timing, it came in over 50. It'll go back down, though.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And last question, then I'll go back in the queue. Magma hit your expectations for the year. How are you thinking about the contribution to the coming year granted you're going to get to a point where you'll annualize it? And I know you're not running it separately. But in terms of how you think it's going to grow and contribute, as you started to get maintenance contracts that come back up for renewal, contracts that come back where you're getting opportunity to upsell? So what have you kind of factored in, in terms of what Magma can help in this fiscal year?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, one of the objectives is actually to have FY '13 with there not being a old Synopsys or old Magma. And I think we're already well on our way with that. And we ourselves at times find, therefore, it's difficult to look back on acquisitions and say, \u201cHow well did \"the acquisition\" do?\u201d because the whole point is for the acquisition to help the overall company do well. And that means that we transition customers as fast as we possibly can to the resulting product portfolio. But the tradition -- that transition has 2 other components. One is the fact that in that also comes the opportunity to come out with better products that have more capabilities or are better integrated or that accelerates some area, and I think we've already seen positive impact of that. And I mentioned some of the things in the preamble. And the second thing, just as important, is how does it give us an opportunity to improve or broaden or accelerate the relationship with customers. And there's no question that the Magma acquisition has helped us go back to those customers, look at the roadmaps together and actually plot a path that turned out to be better for the customer than either scenarios they would've had with us individually. And so that is probably the best accomplishment that we've had to date with this. So looking forward, we think actually it is very much part of growing the company to the high-single-digit EPS number for this coming year.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "First, I was wondering if your view of the -- just the overall EDA market has changed as far as growth for the next few years. Are you still kind of in that mid-single-digits range?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think the ramp of our -- on our industry is a little bit that it's in a good phase in the sense that precisely because customers are so competitive and precisely because they are adopting new technology, maybe faster than what many of the providers of the technology even would have expected, the need and demand for a really strong EDA tool has increased. And so in that context, we certainly think that the core can be very solidly in the mid-single-digit growth. Some of the other areas we've said are in the low-double-digit growth. And so for us, we keep essentially setting the same objective over multiyears, which is high-single-digit growth on EPS as the final result. And as mentioned, ever since we started to do that, we have certainly beaten up that objective. But every year is a new year, and so we'll try again.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And you talked about you had low double digits for the IP side. Is that where you think the market's going out as well, is that you just taking a little share, getting a little bigger in that space?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think the market is doing well across-the-board for us. There's no question that our field is very competitive and Synopsys is doing well. But the impression initially I get is that overall EDA is in a good position.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then now that you're in the emulation business, are you also seeing strength? And as we're hearing from Mentor and Cadence that it\u2019s a pretty strong market right now.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, obviously, we were aware of that before we acquired emulation, otherwise we wouldn't have done so. We are now going through the very same process as we have with some of this other acquisition, which is this very fast, go to the customers, understand exactly what matters most to them and then come back to them with very strong roadmaps. And this is particularly relevant to the area of emulation because it is not standalone. It is very much part of the overall verification solution. You heard from the initial introduction that we also acquired SpringSoft, which brings also a lot of verification technologies specifically in the debug area. And, of course, Synopsys is very well known for the superfast simulator. And so you take some of those things together, you have the potential for really a next generation solution. And that is really what we're driving at. Emulation itself is very promising to us, and the next few quarters, we'll probably demonstrate that quickly.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I mean, emulation is strong today. Do you also view that as a leading indicator for the industry, if you will, that...", "Aart J. de Geus", "No, I do not, partially because there are many variables on an industry, and the type of people that use emulation have a particular set of challenges that some will actually in a downturn accelerate their investment, some in a downturn do just the opposite, which is stop buying hardware. And so I do think that, as with all the other technologies that we provide, at the end of the day is how much can we accelerate the competitiveness of our customers. And that is why it's actually good for us to take the time with these new technologies, and by the way also some fantastic technologists in the team, to really visit the most important customers and plot out how we can help them over a multiyear outlook. And so far the resonance is quite positive.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, when you look at the range of the share cap that you typically give, is the variable there just share repurchases?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It's both sides. The issuance of new equity, and again, there we see our stock overhangs dropping below the double-digit points and moving that in good condition. And it's really a function of what we issue and what we buy back. Our last buybacks were back in Q1, and it's a factor that given the significant levels of M&A in 2012 specifically, that is the ongoing top priority for use of our cash in that period. And finally, the last thing is the price of the stock is also reflected in the fully diluted share count as well.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe just one more here. You talked about a 100-basis-point improvement in the operating margin over the next year. Is that benefiting from both IP and the core space or is it mainly the core space?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It is both, actually, we've had very nice in our 100-point improvement in 2012, all product lines contributed to that operating margin improvement, and we'd expect that again in '13.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Brian, would it be fair to say that for the fourth quarter, the strength of your maintenance and services business was highly correlated to the strength of your IP and Systems business and that both of those in turn were highly correlated to the strength of your Asia-Pac business as well in the fourth quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, good connection between the dots. There has been a very significant growth in our IP and Systems business this year overall, almost 22%. Of that, the level of maintenance and support provided by the business unit has also been very, very strong, reflecting increased positioning we've got in the market and the ability for us to offer a small level of customization to make sure all of those products will continue to work in that way. And it's not necessarily just Asia, but it really is growth across the -- all of our regions for growth in IP and Systems and growth in services, too. But Asia was a very strong grower this year.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And over the past 2 years, particularly since you bought Virage, would it be fair to say that the profitability of the IP business has increased more quickly than the overall corporate growth and profitability? And if so, would you think that can continue into fiscal '13?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, it has. Very strong growth in our profitability levels. We continue to indicate that overall operating margins for that business are less than the corporate average. But it just reflects the fact that it is more resource-intensive as we port the IP to various geometries and all of the manufacturing platforms. So -- but very, very good growth in Systems and IP profitability, a very good contributor.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. For Aart, technical question regarding EVE. Could you comment at all on whether you foresee expanding the range of functionality that they've been offering to date in emulation to give broader coverage of various types of emulation and simulation that those kinds of hardware perform? And then related to that, how do you see the positioning or prospects of your emulation business versus your prototyping business?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Excellent question. Obviously, we have a set of capabilities within Synopsys that is very strong specifically in the compilation side of things. And the reason that's obvious is because we were first and foremost a very, very strong simulation company. And so bringing some of those capabilities to the emulator dramatically broadens its appeal because while it is well known to be the fastest emulator in run time, from a mapping to circuit onto the emulator, we can certainly improve and we have all the technology in-house to do that. Now with that, obviously, comes the opportunity to do many other types of checks, embed various testing schemes for example. The other aspect is the relationship to prototyping, and that's also a very good question because it illustrates that in all of our solution, we really have a very broad continuum of solutions that range from completely software to completely hardware. These things are extremely complementary. And we have actually customers that use both in the same solution. And so in different phases of the verification, one tends to use one over the other for different types of tasks. But the fact that we can essentially reduce the risk of moving from one to the other going forward is actually of high benefit to our customers.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. A couple of last ones. For Brian, for the $100 million of combined EVE and SpringSoft revenue in fiscal '13, could you talk about how much each might contribute within the $100 million, and what the deferred revenue hit was, if any, that you're baking in?", "Brian M. Beattie", "We're not breaking out the financials for EVE. As you know, they were a private company. The element of SpringSoft, again a publicly traded company in Taiwan, we wanted to highlight that the combination of both of those would contribute about $100 million in revenue only to ensure that we get aligned on the Synopsis model. SpringSoft is a little bit more upfront revenue, and again, we're moving all of that into the Synopsys model of how we've got it lined up. The deferred revenue haircut was not a meaningful impact, given the various accounting standards being used in Taiwan and France and had a minimal impact in terms of deferred revenue adjustments for those 2 transactions.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. If I could just follow up on a question Sterling asked earlier about the LAVA expectation for fiscal '13, early on right after you bought them, I think you had targeted something close to $100 million for LAVA in fiscal '13. I didn't hear if you reaffirmed that number or not.", "Brian M. Beattie", "It's at the point where we have fully integrated, again, the businesses as we try to extract the both ongoing backlog of products acquired from Magma and integrate that with the integration of our new Synopsys/Magma product integrations. It's something we're -- again, we're reconfirming, it's about $100 million run rate on that business. That's the amount we expected when we started with the acquisition. It was about $60 million in 2012, and we anticipated the impact of that on Synopsys would be about $100 million. And we're still on track for that, and that's factored into the 2013 guidance.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, a question on several OEMs entering the design market more recently, LG and Apple is a well-known one, is that driving an incremental growth to the EDA industry?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in general, it's an indication that some of the end users would like to have a stronger tie from their system solutions all the way to the silicon technology and/or may want to become more proprietary about the secrets of what they're putting in their devices. And so the way we look at this is this is all part of a very, very competitive landscape with an enormous amount of very rapid changes. The good news is that Synopsys is used in all of the very advanced solutions extensively and that our support teams are actually very instrumental at helping people be successful. And so in that context, the answer to your question is yes, we do see this as an additional opportunity for growth in those systems houses that in the past didn't do all that much design but now are certainly very, very dependent on it and actually banking on it for their differentiation. So these are good opportunities for us.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And one more question on your revenue guidance. Is it fair to say that you're building in a lot of conservatism? I mean your historical pattern has been you have most of the time beat the guidance. So I would think that you're probably airing on the side of conservatism because of -- the organic growth is more low single digit in your guidance?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, that's a judgment call you have to make. If there's one thing that we have been very steady on is that we're setting roughly the same guidance partially because we want to adhere to a general multiyear driving of the company, which is to achieve high-single-digit EPS. Now if we can do better, obviously we'll do our best to do that. But at this point in time, we just started the year. There's no reason to be more aggressive. But we did mention that we feel that we're entering the year with strong momentum. We've made some fabulous acquisitions. There's a lot of work to do in an unknown landscape. So the company, I think, is in a very good shape.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was having a similar question. If I exclude the acquisitions' contribution of $200 million from Magma, EVE and SpringSoft, the core business is roughly flat for fiscal '13. And that is a fair bit lower than the mid-single-digit type growth you mentioned for the core business. I just wanted to make sure that, that was more conservatism from your part or is it some reflection of what you're seeing that customer trends? We've seen at least one customer, TI, talk about reducing some of the design activities. I was wondering if it's customer-driven or more conservatism.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, Satya, let me run with that one. First off, I don't know if I misheard you, but I think you might have said $200 million of revenue from Magma, right? We're saying...", "Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "No. Magma, EVE and SpringSoft, all 3 put together.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, all 3 of them in terms of growth for '13 over '12, first of all, take into account that there was a 2% impact on revenues. Our revenue forecast right now is 11% to 12% or that would have been 13% to 14% adjusting for the extra week. When we look at the growth of SpringSoft and EVE, we saw growth of approximately $100 million. And then secondly, recall that if Magma's going to do -- Magma equivalent is about $100 million in '13, that's up from $60 million in '12. So there's about $40 million of growth there. So it's very close. Both the organic businesses are growing very solidly, and the M&A impact of the deals completed in 2012 are going to have a very positive impact as well in setting us up in '13 and for growth beyond that point. So it's very balanced between growth of both the overall numbers of 13% to 14% adjusted for the week and a nice balance between organic and M&A impact. Both are solid.", "Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. I should have -- I could follow up with you guys, but I think I took out the IP and Systems growth as well as a higher growth piece. And I looked at the IP Systems and the 3 pieces taking out the rest of the core business was a bit flat, but I can follow up with you guys on that. And separately on the EVE and SpringSoft, you mentioned that it added $9 million in incremental revenues and about a similar amount in terms of cost. Is that the type of operating margin contribution you're expecting just mainly positive in 2013?", "Aart J. de Geus", "No, we've said the impact would be slightly accretive in 2013. And again, it's more a function of aligning the previous businesses into the Synopsys time-based license capabilities so that we'll have that 90% of revenue going forward coming from the backlog. So in combination, the 2 businesses would contribute about $100 million of revenue and be slightly accretive in '13. So obviously expenses, nicely less than $100 million. And that's just the transition year, if you like, the first full year that we have the business and continue to focus on improvements and synergies across the company with those.", "Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "How will the margins from that piece look in fiscal '13?", "Brian M. Beattie", "We're not projecting that yet. And in fact, the businesses will be totally integrated by that point. And again, the value is harder to identify than the acquisitions, as both for a very deep comprehensive perspective on verification technology throughout the company and enhancing our position in some of the analog services, particularly inside of APAC in that. So a lot of strategic value as well as very strong financials coming from a combination of these businesses.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One follow-up. I'm kind of curious, have you guys made any moves in terms of your pricing on any of the products? Have you raised any prices in the last several quarters? Or how do you think about the pricing dynamics as you look to 2013?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think that in general, it's always hard to see that pricing would change rapidly. It has not in the past, either up or down. However, I do think that we see that EDA industry right now is doing relatively well, and so that gives a little bit more backbone in terms of the pricing as we negotiate going forward because customers are very much looking at us as their best bet of their own success and differentiation. So I don't want to overstate it because it's hard to have really specific evidence when you do a lot of 3-year deals. On the other hand, in general, I think we're in a stronger position than we were, let's say, a year ago.", "Operator", "Thank you. And as [indiscernible] speakers at this time, there are no additional questions.", "Aart J. de Geus", "In that case, we thank you for your participation in this earnings release. I think it's clear to say that not only was Q4 a strong year, there's no question that fiscal '12 was a very strong year, not only by virtue of execution but also by virtue of the acquisition and technology leaps we did forward. And so if nothing else, I would like to leave you with the strong sense that Synopsys feels momentum going into '13 that notwithstanding whatever the landscape looks around us, we feel that we're a very solid company financially speaking and technically. And so we're actually entering FY '13 with very good hopes for good results. Thank you for your attention, and thank you for your support for FY '12.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today.

Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. And 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Rochelle. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am happy to report that in Q1, our business, technology progress and customer engagements were strong across the board. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, achieving revenue of $475 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67. As a result of this excellent start to the year, as well as reinstatements of the federal R&D tax credit, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2013 to a range of $2.35 to $2.40, up solidly from our high single-digit guidance into double-digit growth.", "Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. Before discussing some highlights, let me briefly comment on the customer landscape, which fundamentally has not changed much from last quarter but benefits from a slightly more stable macroeconomic outlook.", "Against this backdrop, we see the semiconductor industry continuing a very aggressive push, both in terms of technology and efficiency. The technology drive is motivated by companies seeking to differentiate themselves by adopting a wave of emerging new semiconductor capabilities. The efficiency push addresses the challenge of delivering these new technologies under aggressive product cycle and cost requirements. The EDA industry, and Synopsys in particular, is a key partner in these quests.", "Increasingly, customers see their EDA relationship as an essential differentiator in their market battles. Although difficult to generalize in our very competitive landscape, we do sense a bit of improvement in the pricing environment and business terms. The corollary to my comment on differentiation is this. Customers and suppliers increasingly realize that to navigate the intersection of advanced technology, unforgiving time to market and intense competition, close collaboration is essential. Synopsys' focus on both points tool [ph] leadership and integrated solutions makes us a desirable supplier, and our collaboration with advanced customers and key partners continues to yield great results.", "Just last week, for example, we further expanded our broad collaboration agreement with ARM to include the latest ARMv8 processor models. Working with mutual customers, Synopsys and ARM jointly accelerate product development cycles around ARM's latest processors. State-of-the-art collaboration relies on the constant delivery of new capabilities, so let me provide some recent product highlights.", "On the implementation side, Synopsys supports a continued aggressive adoption of more complex design nodes. Simultaneously, we see a fundamental discontinuity in the structure of the transistor. We're closely working with silicon providers to roll out evolving technology to address these challenges. With the structure of the transistor itself migrating from horizontal to new vertical FinFETs, better power and performance open the door to great new applications. It also brings about a slew of technical challenges in EDA and IP, challenges for which Synopsys is particularly well equipped, again making us a key partner in our customers' future differentiation.", "As an example of how customers rely on us, 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs today have used Synopsys implementation, while we're already working with some all the way back down to 10 nanometers.", "Synopsys is the only EDA company that has been investing for many years in FinFET enablement throughout our portfolio, from 3-dimensional TCAD simulation to photolithography to manufacturing tools, to physical placement, routing, extraction and verification, to circuit simulation and custom design, all the way to sophisticated IP libraries, memories and building blocks.", "A good example of multiyear collaboration in this area is with Samsung, where we successfully taped out the first test chip on their 14-nanometer low-power process. Samsung chose Synopsys as its FinFET partner because of our successful 20-nanometer collaboration history and our comprehensive FinFET focus throughout our portfolio.", "As advanced transistor research accelerates, demand for our 3D TCAD products continues to grow. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Imec, a world-leading research center, to jointly optimize FinFET technology for 10-nanometer and below design.", "Multiyear collaborations have not only yielded a number of advanced tape-outs, but today, we are also selling our own FinFET-based embedded memory libraries and logic IP.", "Finally, through the acquisition of SpringSoft, we also have a FinFET-ready custom implementation solution. Notwithstanding the emphasis on advanced technology, our business with customers who are focused on more established nodes is also strong. These customers invariably squeeze performance, power and area out of their chips to be competitive. We recently demonstrated that advances made in our leading-edge tools have great impact on established nodes as well, most notably in run time and capacity, which is a good transition to the topic of verification.", "The move to smaller transistors also enables the other side of Moore's Law, many more transistors. Indeed, the overall complexity of not only chips but systems of chips is precisely what makes continued end product innovation possible. Verifying these products is the largest bottleneck in electronics.", "Just looking at the latest smartphones, one finds multiple multicore processors with hundreds of millions of transistors coupled with complex operating systems, applications, networking and wireless protocols. Not only is the hardware complex, but so is the interaction of the hardware and the software. Solving these verification challenges has been a major focus for Synopsys for many years.", "Today, we are the market leader in both leading-edge digital verification with about 70% of advanced designs using -- utilizing Synopsys and analog simulation, where 80% of the designs rely on our tools. VCS, which continues to grow well, is the fastest simulator on the market today.", "With the acquisition of EVE, we also have added the fastest hardware emulator, and combined with our HAPS FPGA boards, we cover the entire hardware validation and hardware software verification space. With the acquisition of SpringSoft, we've added to our portfolio the most compressive open debug system, thus, addressing the entire verification market with outstanding point tools. We have started to combine the best features of these, and we're driving integration of all the elements into a full-line verification solution. Initial customer reaction has been strongly positive, as we have quickly asked for feedback from them. We're now well into the process of developing and communicating combined roadmaps. Both the EVE and SpringSoft integrations are progressing very well.", "The third area I would like to briefly highlight is IP and Systems, which now represents 1/4 of our revenue. We're the second largest IP vendor with approximately 1,400 IP engineers worldwide designing the most complex IP blocks, importing to all key foundry processes.", "After 15 years of investment, our DesignWare IP is shipped in more than 1 billion chips per year. Every 2 days, a chip is taped out using our USB. Every week, a chip tapes out with our PCI Express, and customers have already delivered tens of millions of chips containing our 28-nanometer IP.", "Today, Synopsys is the #1 vendor in interface cores, analog IP and embedded memories. And the market for more IP, including the sub-20-nanometer nodes, continues to expand. We intend to grow our IP business at double-digit rate while gradually increasing its profitability, as we've successfully done in the last 2 years.", "In systems, we're seeing momentum in both software and hardware-based prototyping. This is promising as we've invested in this area for a number of years, believing that hardware/software verification, as well as the ability to develop software earlier in the process would grow in importance over time. This quarter, 2 large and influential electronic companies increased deployment of virtual prototyping, driving good run rate growth.", "As the key enabler to early modeling of chips for software development, we expect virtual prototyping to grow gradually and become more mainstream as system complexity emerges as the weak link in time to market. Bridging between systems and verification, our earlier mentioned FPGA-based prototyping systems, HAPS is doing very well also. With a who's who of customers, our newly launched HAPS-70 Series, which uses the most advanced FPGAs on the market, was named Electronics Design's 2012 EDA Product of the Year.", "In summary, Synopsys is doing very well in all dimensions: technology progress, customer collaboration and financial execution. In Q1, we delivered results that serve as an excellent start to the year. And as a consequence, we're raising EPS guidance to reflect confidence in our outlook.", "I will now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year.", "In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. Q1 financial results were highlighted by double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings. And now some additional detail.", "As a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting revenue and total non-GAAP expenses by approximately $25 million and $16 million, respectively. Total revenue was $475 million, an increase of 12% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Normalizing for the extra week in FY '12, revenue grew 19%. Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue.", "The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.4 years, affected by a couple of large 1-year add-on deals. We continue to expect the average duration for fiscal 2013 to be about 2.7 years.", "Turning to expenses. Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were $414 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $18 million of stock-based compensation. Q1 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $355 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases in compensation and other expenses from our recent acquisitions.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the quarter. For all of FY '13, we are on track to expand non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points over FY '12.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.45. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.67, exceeding our target range. Normalizing for the extra week in FY '12, earnings grew 31%. Earnings outperformance was driven primarily by a lower-than-expected tax rate, as well as higher-than-expected other income, along with operational execution.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for the quarter, well below our target range, driven primarily by January's reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The Q1 2013 tax rate includes a retroactive benefit of $6 million for fiscal year 2012, in addition to the impact of the tax credit for Q1 of 2013. As a result, we now think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with $550 million in cash and cash equivalents with 27% onshore and 73% offshore. As expected, there was a net operating cash outflow. The Q1 outflow of $91 million was due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments. We continue to target operating cash flow of at least $350 million in FY '13.", "During the quarter, we paid back $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan. We did not spend back cash -- spent cash to repurchase our stock. However, we will consider buying back stock during the year, the amount and timing of which would depend on acquisition opportunities. We have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "DSO declined 7 days to 52 days. And we ended Q1 with 8,165 employees with about 1/3 in lower-cost geographies.", "Now let's address our second quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the second quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $490 million and $500 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $409 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $362 million and $372 million; other income and expense between $1 million and a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% to 25%; outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.44 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.63 to $0.65 per share. We expect about 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2013 outlook. Revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14% excluding the extra week in 2012; other income and expense between $1 million and $5 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23%; outstanding shares between $155 million and $159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 to $1.56, which includes the impact of approximately $70 million of stock-based compensation expense; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40, which represents solid double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of at least $350 million. To assist in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be greater than first half revenue, and total non-GAAP expenses are expected to be skewed towards the second half of the year.", "In summary, we're pleased with our excellent first quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth and continued solid operating margin. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, you mentioned that you are seeing maybe a slightly more stable macroenvironment. But I would think that government agencies and perhaps aerospace companies that are exposed to government might be seeing some hesitation due to the potential for sequestration coming. And have you seen any of that? And if not, do you think you might?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Thanks, Rich. It's a good question. We have indeed seen a little bit of that with some of the government-related businesses that are just a little bit more careful before committing to whatever renewal they may have. At the same time, that is a relatively small portion of our business and is completely overshadowed by the much bigger companies, certainly bigger in terms of their EDA spending, that are driving all the commercial markets and the global markets. And so I just happen to know of one case where what you said is true, and that's all I know. So it's not very heavy on our mind.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "No, that's great. And then, Aart, some pretty positive comments with respect to your positioning with respect to FinFET adoption and the move to kind of 3D. Can you say if you think you're seeing incremental purchasing for FinFET implementation sort of above and beyond what you might have seen, if folks have been sticking with 2D? Or do you think this is sort of a normal progression that there's sort of a continuous progression where there's always purchasing being done for sort of the next technology?", "Aart J. de Geus", "So I do not think it's the normal progression. And actually, one of the reasons I'm bullish on FinFET, in general, is because I think FinFET heralds another decade of Moore's Law. And that's a pretty bold statement given how many people have said, well, it's all getting too expensive, too difficult, which are all sort of true statements. But the fact is from being an interesting idea 2 years ago to at least one company having already a shift in production FinFET capabilities to now all the key manufacturers really raising forward to get this capability, you can, at a minimum, see an industry that's making a big bet that FinFET adds new life to Moore's Law. And in my opinion, there's actually a fairly simple explanation why it's good and it's a difficult explanation on how do you make it work, which is that FinFETs have the potential over this continually and performance power ratio. And power has been one of the key limiters in modern semiconductors. The fact that it's difficult is actually something we love because Synopsys is focused on making problems like that go away. And in that context, I'm not surprised at all that there are heavy investments in simulation, in modeling. I think we have the place and routes and things already completely under control. And so now the next phase is really for the semiconductor industry to arrive at good yields for this, and that will take a couple of years. But I wouldn't be surprised if a number of design companies go fairly light on the 20-nanometer node because they really want to go full bore on the FinFET wave. And so there's a lot of work that we have and can do with those companies. And from that perspective, I think it bodes well for the EDA industry.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then I'm wondering if you can give some thoughts on the emulation market and the growth prospects there. Obviously, you became a sort of a new player in that with your EVE acquisition. Obviously, one of the largest players in that market in their recent report said they were looking for a down year in '13. So I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the medium-term growth prospects for the emulation market.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think that for any given company, you can have up and down years partially because that's just the reality of when people buy something, they may buy a lot and then they don't buy that much the subsequent year. I wouldn't make too much out of these ups and downs. I think in general, there's no question that verification is a big topic, that's going to be bigger as we see even more transistors and even bigger systems needing to be verified. In the emulation field, of course, everybody hopes that they have the gold standard of technology. But the reality there is that there are different needs and applications. And I think we will see steady growth for all the players. So I expect it to be a healthy market even if there may be quarter-to-quarter some ups and downs.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And just one final one, if I could, for you, Brian. I mean, it looks like you guys beat by about $0.12 on the quarter and you mentioned what the different contributing factors were. And you increased your EPS range for the year by about $0.09. So wondering if maybe there was some shifting of expenses out of the first quarter or something that maybe you're figuring or that catch you in Q2 or Q3. Any color on that will be helpful.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, maybe what I can do is just kind of break out some of the significant overachievements in the quarter and how that profiles into the rest of the year. So first off, in terms of the achievements, we had about $0.06 flow-through as a result of the federal R&D tax credits for both '12 and '13. And that means about $0.04 for '12 and about $0.02 for the first quarter of '13. We had some improvements on other income that related to mark-to-market adjustments we had for our currency hedges. And we don't expect that to reiterate again for the rest of the year. And then we had some operational improvements, a little bit higher revenue, a little bit less in terms of spending. And then as you say, we did increase our overall guidance by about $0.09, which reflects that, plus the continuing R&D tax credit for quarters 2 through 4. So that gives us the additional $0.03 just coming from the tax side. So the rest of the year, we look at it. It's still early on. It obviously gives us the flexibility of making the target investments we need to invest in for providing that longer-term growth such as the IP areas. And again, happy to see we now have top line double-digit growth in '13 and top line bottom line growth as well.", "Operator", "Your next question from the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Shankar. Given the strong M&A activity in FY '12, I just wanted to get your view on capital allocation this year. Will your primary use of cash still largely be focused on acquisitions? Or could priorities start shifting towards maybe buybacks or potentially a dividend?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, as you know, we have multiple ways to use the cash, and M&A is something that you have to sort of build up towards. And so at any point in time, we want to maintain a certain amount of cash level. We have a little bit of debt that we are very gradually buying back. That is just a good health discipline. In that context, the 2 things that we really trade off is M&A versus buybacks. And we contemplate both pretty much all the time. And so we have an open authorization from the board. We have done it in the past. We are certainly well versed in understanding that decreasing the share count is a good thing. At the same time, doing good acquisitions grows the business going forward. And as you well know, we don't comment much about any M&A we may do. But fundamentally, our strategies at Synopsys have not changed. In terms of dividend, that is not a pathway that we have chosen to date, and we are not really contemplating it right now either.", "Brian M. Beattie", "And maybe, Tom, if I may just add to that as well. Of course, as you know, buybacks require U.S. cash to be able to enact that. And we're currently sitting after the end of our first quarter with about $150 million in U.S. cash. And again, we anticipate that amount -- apart from M&A discussions, we expect that amount to continue to grow from now until the end of the year as well, which gives us more flexibility on that side, too.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And can you talk a little bit about progress around the integration of EVE? And within your unchanged revenue guidance for the full year, should we still be expecting roughly $100 million from both EVE and SpringSoft combined?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, I think that number feels in the right ballpark, although I don't recall exactly what times we may have given. One of the reasons, to be honest, I don't quite recall the guidance, is once we start integrating, it is quite surprising how quickly the old companies fade away largely because we have the benefit of a much broader sales force and a broader market appeal. And the products get either integrated or associated with other things that we sell. Having said that, I think the progress on integration is actually quite good. We have no big surprises to deal with. We are, of course, looking immediately at areas where we can strengthen the technology or areas where customers are looking at us now having a broader portfolio. And in general, the verification field is one where we clearly added a lot of capabilities. Lastly, the ultimate barometer, of course, is the customer reaction. The initial reactions have been very positive. And so the next 12-month reactions is, of course, in terms of so, how much do they buy, and that will be the metric against which we measure our success.", "Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And final one from me. You talked a little bit about IP. Can you provide us an update on the percentage of IP that is currently outsourced today? And will you see that penetration of outsourced IP reaching over the next year or 2 where it's expected to level off?", "Aart J. de Geus", "There are a lot of different estimates on that. One of them says that today, about 50% is outsourced. But having literally just had the, not exactly that discussion but a similar discussion yesterday with the product -- the vice president of marketing of group, he was commenting that it's not only that percentage itself that is relevant, it's also the fact that IP we use in general is growing. And so I think right now, we see a good horizon for our capabilities because it is growing, also because the type of IP is becoming more and more complex. And again, that plays well to our strength. So it's an area that, while demanding investments to build the IP, I think the business potential is good for us.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Aart, I'm just kind of curious. For 2013, what do you think are the end markets that are going to pull through that demand, and especially that demand for the smaller geometry and FinFET design chips?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in one word, mobile, right? Mobile just drives everything still like crazy for a couple of reasons. A, it's super high volume. And so that gets everybody's attention, and therefore, there's also a high attention being put on the price of the chips. But secondly is because everything mobile is limited in its performance by the power consumption. And so any promise that one could have more capabilities with, let's say, the same power, because that's typically what happens, is of high value in future product differentiation. I do not expect that to change at all. Now around mobility, of course, is the whole infrastructure that has to support this. Sometimes people call it the cloud. Sometimes people call it the compute centers but -- or data centers. And they are essentially a reflection of not only the amount of -- the number of mobile devices but also the tremendous traffic that is engendered by them. Both of these -- those will continue. The number of companies that are leading this is not super large but is very, very focused and very aggressive. And so that is why I have a high degree of confidence that as soon as FinFET yields well, we're going to see a lot of activity there.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you. On the contract duration side, can you give us an idea, if you strip out the 1-year deals, what duration would have looked like? And can you confirm again, did I hear correct, those 1-year deals were only add-ons, they were not renewals?", "Brian M. Beattie", "That's correct, yes. We had just a number of add-ons where customers already have a 3-year deal. And then they look towards the end of the contract expiry and say, \"Hey, we just need another 1-year addition to what we already have in place to handle some additional seats and applications.\" So that's how they look at it. Our average, again, for the year, we'll say, is the 2.7 to 2.8 years. And just based on the first quarter that came in at 2.4, we think it will revert back to the mean.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. So stripping out those 1-year, there's nothing that dissuade you from that 2.7 for the year, obviously?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No, no, it doesn't, no.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then back to the guidance question; the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and the performance in the first quarter, did you guys decide to increase investment for either the rest of the year or perhaps the second half? Or can you just maybe give us at least the -- some additional color on your thoughts around what the operating margin for the year in terms of what you're thinking about how it trends there?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Absolutely. Yes, we're still on track on the operating margin question, to be approximately 100 basis points improvement, which builds on last year's 100-basis-point improvement as well. When we look at the profile, again, the R&D tax credit is great and then it provided us that flexibility. As we look at the whole year, we've seen a very good first quarter come through, forecast also a very strong second quarter. And then as we just look at it in terms of tweaking the overall quarterly profile of expenses to maintain that double-digit EPS growth as well for the year. And in the second half is typically where you see the impact coming from compensation increases that are in place from our facilities around the world. We see that factor coming in, some increased headcount as a result of the investments. And these investments in the second half are really essential as we drive continued growth through '14 and beyond. So again, we're just targeting those investments towards the back half of the year, and that's what's factored into our profile.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And last question because I know it's going to come up -- it's already come up in a couple of conversations with investors. Looking at the quarter, the sales and marketing expenses where one area that provided some EPS upside, at least relative to our estimates. And we all think about sales commissions tied to bookings from that line item. Is there anything in the 1-year add-on deals that perhaps leads to lower sales commission expense that could explain it or anything else that we should kind of factor in?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Not really, no. I'd just stay with the total year expectation around expenses that we were addressing. And it just reflects from quarter to quarter the amount of profile towards the business levels that come through. And other than that, it comes in a little bit this quarter and the next quarter goes back up, that type of thing. It just moves around. So again, it's just some of the hiring, some of the headcount that came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and anticipate that picking up again in the second quarter and beyond.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the next question from the line of Thomas Diffely of D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Just first, Brian, to clarify, you said there was a $0.02 impact from the R&D tax for the -- in the first quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, that's correct. Yes, for the FY '13 impact.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And what was your expectation then for the full year? Is it $0.02 per quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No, it's about a $0.01 each over the next 3 quarters. So it's about $0.05 for FY '13 and about $0.04 for FY '12. That makes up your $0.09 profile.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then when you look at the kind of the increase in the non-GAAP expenses in the second half, is that more fourth quarter loaded like it typically is?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It's a little bit more towards the fourth quarter, but almost even, just a little bit higher in the fourth, based on the profile we've got right now. And again, those compensation increases kick in about the June timeframe, and then the rest is profile of the investment and headcount growth that we've got. So it kind of leans a little bit towards the fourth but not too far off the third.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then earlier, you guys were talking about the pricing getting a little bit better. Was that on the core EDA side versus the IP side?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, it's on the core business.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And also, Aart, we've heard from some of the large foundries lately that there's been a ramp-up in 20-nanometer business with some new customers that's actually emerging out of Asia, China, in particular. Is that becoming a meaningful part of your business at this point, some of these new fabless players at the leading edge?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes and no. China has been growing in general over the last few years. And in parallel to that, the technical competence has steadily moved up. And so now there are a few players in China that do very advanced design. And of course, they tend to quickly also become the biggest spenders in that geography. Even so, they are still relatively small compared to the really very large international companies that have been leading the field. But I think this will steadily grow, and we are doing particularly well with them because of the advanced nodes. So I think we are increasingly in a very global world that includes China and the technology just follow suit.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then also earlier, you talked about the FinFET and how that was going to drive growth going forward. Do you see similar trends from things such as 3D NAND that's on the horizon, as well as EUV? How do those technologies impact both your design of your products as well as what the market might be longer term?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, just to clarify, there are 2 types of 3D. One is inside of the chip, which is 3D, often referred to as the FinFET, a vertical transistor. The other 3D that's often used as a term is the stacking in various forms of multiple chips. And for a while, people looked at the second one as an alternative just in case the 3D transistor wasn't coming about. Well, I think the 3D transistor is absolutely coming about, which doesn't negate the need for the second one, but I think that will take its time. When you're talking about things like EUV, you're talking about a whole new form of photolithography. And the jury is still very, very much out in terms of how economically viable this is and when it becomes economically viable. And so most of the investments that go in that direction are in the equipment manufacturing industry. And yes, we touch it a little bit because we have some R&D efforts in photolithography and how to model these things. But from a volume or big deployment point of view, I think it's premature to look at that as a major business.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, on the NAND side, I know memory hasn't been a big driver of EDA tools in general, but when an industry does towards more of the perpendicular -- or I should said say the vertical NAND structure, does that increase complexity enough to kind of kick up the EDA spend?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, if I may slightly correct the perception, we actually have done quite a bit of very good business with memory providers. And there's a lot of simulation that gets done for all of the different memory types. And moreover, memories today are so large that you have to build in all the logic to fix them because almost no memory is perfect. And so they have a lot of self-correcting capabilities, and that actually demands some of the place and route tools. And so it is clearly its own segment. But as a segment per se, we have done quite well with it, and we expect it to continue to grow.", "Operator", "And the next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of financial questions first for Brian and then market questions for Aart. First, Brian, in the fourth quarter, there was a very close correlation between your IP, your services and your Asia Pac revenues. I'm wondering if there was a similar correlation at all in terms of several forms of business in the first quarter? Or at least perhaps you could explain the strength you saw in your maintenance and services line. And then secondly, for you as well, could you talk about your cash flow expectations? You took up your GAAP earnings expectations for the year, but you left your cash flow the same. It's clear your GAAP net income will be higher for the year, plus your depreciation and amortization and your stock-based comp. So is there something in working capital that you're thinking will be negative or adverse to your total cash flow for the year?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Good questions. Okay, Jay, let me run through that. On the first one about the services business and our IP business. Over the last 18 months or so, we've seen a small shift in the makeup of the business. So we now see a significant amount of what we call percentage completion on contracts entering from a number of the acquisitions we've done. And as we advance to really some incredible technologies, we have to get in and tweak some of the software that goes into the IP. And when you look at things like percentage completion and deliverables of that, as well as the hardware business now related to both emulation and our hardware prototyping businesses, those have a slightly different profile relative to our traditional 3-year businesses. So again, just as I say, tweaking the profiles of that. Hardware is typically taken upfront. The percentage completion on services is exactly that as the job gets done. But it's typically over a 6-months period and not a 3-year window as a traditional license is taken. So apart from that, anything else is just coincidental based on timing of those deliverables and when we make the commitment. On your cash flow question, as we look at the total year, again, still feel comfortable with approximately $350 million of good cash inflow for the year. And relative to tax benefits and other things that go through, again, it just kind of comes into account for where the specific cash flows are forecast originally. And again, this is predominantly a U.S. R&D tax credit. So obviously, it has an impact on our U.S. taxes payable. And we're in pretty good shape based on that, and it helps build up NOLs and other tax elements for us going forward. So no change to the overall forecast. I think it's a good, solid number. And the other point you brought up about amortizations and capital and all the rest, there's really no change in those numbers for the year.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. For Aart, a couple of things. I'd like to ask how you're thinking about your organic growth in core EDA. And currently, you have high, if not majority, share in a number of large categories. Systems [ph] is obviously implementation, RTL simulation and most of analysis where you have very strong share. Yet each of those categories is not necessarily growing at or above the industry growth rate. So could you talk about your components or your drivers of getting to your, I think, mid-single-digit core EDA growth assumption? Can you -- do you need FinFET and the other incremental forms of business you talked about to just get to mid-single-digit core EDA? Do you think that what you've been talking about tonight can get you above your prior comments about core EDA growth?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay. Well, let me first characterize where this comes from. We've been talking now for a number of years that we enter a year typically with an objective to be high single-digit growth and that we characterize that over a long period of time as the core being in the mid-single digit and then some of the other capabilities such as IP being in double digit. And this all sort of adds up to high single-digit growth. Now having said that, the last 2 years, we clearly exceeded on that. Right now, we just communicated that we are very solidly in double-digit growth for this year, so we anticipate. And so clearly, we have done better in pretty much all the categories than our steady-state model. We just don't give -- we don't want to give an impression that you can just look at many years out and assume that is always the case. You have to work for it. And so in that context, this year, I think we will do better than these assumptions. Clearly, from an overall market growth point of view, in our industry, we're doing very well. And because of that, our focus is already completely moved towards '14 and '15. And last but not least, much of this is sold in fairly complex schools of technology that mix and match a little bit of everything. And so there's always a slight degree of artificiality to pinpoint the exact growth. But I do you think that in our industry, and specifically for Synopsys, we have a wave of pretty good organic growth.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then lastly, more on the technical side perhaps. Last year at DAC, the company highlighted that you had enabled your critical tools with double patterning as filling an essential need for a design at 20-nanometer and similar advanced nodes. Tonight, you spoke a number of occasions of FinFET and yield of FinFET. Is there some connection between having double pattern enabled your tools and yield on FinFET? Or is there something more you need to do to meet the industry needs for the kind of yield you referred to in this new technology?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay, a very good technical question. Just to -- for the benefit of everybody, let me make sure you understand what we're talking about. When we're talking about FinFETs, we're talking about transistors that right now, most of the industry is focusing on a very small dimension. And I won't go into too much specifics because different companies are very guarded, rightfully so, on what they do. But typically, it is below 20 nanometers. The connections between these transistors, there's a variety of approaches, from above 20-nanometer to below 20-nanometer. And again, different players are looking at different configurations of how to go to market and how to get yields and how to differentiate themselves. As you go below 20-nanometer for many of these dimensions, it becomes mandatory, in many cases, to not have a single flash of light to illuminate a mask, but multiple flashes of light. That's called double patterning. I won't go into any deeper on the technology than that. But it is very sophisticated because it uses the addition and subtraction of light in order to get much more refinement to the picture. You have to think a little bit about how you probably in grad school developed photographs in a dark lab. In order to get it really sharp, you need very good lenses, and we apply all kinds of tricks to that. Having said that, our tools today are completely conversant with double patterning. And that is the necessity to go to the smaller geometries. We're also conversant with the FinFET structures. And so our tools have been used for FinFET chips that are on the market, in production today. They are being used for pretty much all of the tape-outs for the new chips coming out. And so from that perspective, there's a lot of tuning that will happen between now and high-yield FinFETs. But the fundamental technology, as far as Synopsys is concerned, is in place.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in queue. Back to you for closing remarks.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, thank you so much for attending this call. As you saw through our results and through the fact that we increased our guidance, we feel that we have good results and a good outlook going forward. And so we appreciate your comments and questions. And as usual, Brian and I will be available for some follow-ups today. Have a good rest of the afternoon.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Synopsys again delivered strong business, technology and customer results in Q2, meeting or beating every target we communicated last quarter. We achieved revenue of $499 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 and considerable operating cash flow. As a result, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2013 to a range of $2.37 to $2.42, representing solid, double-digit growth for the year. We're also raising our operating cash flow target to $375 million to $400 million. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute.", "Before discussing some highlights, let me comment on the customer landscape, which I would characterize as steady. Semiconductor companies continue to face significant competitive challenges. And while cognizant of ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment, the race for differentiation and time to market, product functionality and advanced technology continues unabated.", "Synopsys has collaborated closely with market leaders for many years. With the high-value, but also, great technical challenges of the latest silicon technologies, more and more customer executives are sharing their future direction with us and how Synopsys is needed to get them there. As a result, we see continued successes and business strengths across key customer segments, the foundries, top IDMs and key fabless customers, particularly in mobile and cloud-related systems companies.", "Let me provide a couple of examples. First, during the quarter, we renewed a significant multiyear agreement with Intel. Second, we've made excellent progress with a large semiconductor company, who had been a competitor stronghold for more than a decade. For a number of years, we have worked closely with them on their most advanced designs. This quarter, with a substantial long-term commitment, they moved to Synopsys as their main partner because of our technology excellence and dedicated support.", "The common denominator driving the largest semiconductor and systems companies is their unrelenting demand for still faster, lower-power and broader-functionality chips. There is increasing commitment to the most advanced processes, as a growing group of customers joined the leaders in migrating to 20-nanometer, 14- and 16-nanometer and even below. The race to 3D FinFET design is very promising, as it has opened another decade of Moore's Law. Specifically, the low-power characteristics of FinFET transistors will impact end-product differentiation and is enabled by Synopsys' leading-edge design tools and IP. There's a rapidly growing set of engagements with customers designed to migrate to FinFETs. Production delivery of FinFETs designed with Synopsys tools has already passed 100 million chips. Our clear and longstanding focus on advanced technology not only positions us well for the future, but has already driven significant design and customer successes.", "To date, 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation, and we're already engaged all the way down to 10 nanometers. Because of the breadth and maturity of our tools, we believe that we have at least 1 year head start over any competitor.", "To support this assertion, let me comment that we have been working on FinFET enablement for half a decade, and almost every FinFET design to date has relied on Synopsys. Our solution is truly comprehensive, ranging from TCADs to design tools to IP to sophisticated support. TCAD is used by foundries for simulation at the earliest stages of technology in FinFET development, giving us 6- to 12-month early access to foundry models. The resulting information feeds into the foundational technologies or HSPICE in extraction, where Synopsys tools are the gold standard.", "From there, our IC Compiler, which is clearly the most advanced and production-proven FinFET physical design system, creates the layout of the chips. In addition, our analog/mixed-signal designer verification tools are well ahead in terms of readiness and qualification for FinFETs.", "We have been engaged in developing FinFET-based IP for several years now and have production-class memory and interface IP ready to integrate into our customers' SoCs. We're engaged with 5 foundries on developing a full range of production-ready IP for them.", "Lastly, our IP design engineers have taped out multiple FinFET test chips for several customer processes. One example of our leadership is the announcement last week that FPGA provider, Achronix,  has standardized on IC Compiler and IC Validator and has taped out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based SoC using Synopsys tools.", "At our Silicon Valley User Group meeting in March, more than 600 engineers attended a standing-room only FinFET panel, featuring Samsung, QUALCOMM, Cavium and GLOBALFOUNDRIES, sharing their early experiences in collaboration with Synopsys. In addition, you may recall that already in December, we announced a successful tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer or low-power test chip. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of a successful collaboration history and the comprehensive capabilities throughout our portfolio.", "Now let me turn to verification, which is the largest bottleneck in system and chip design today. Synopsys has been developing verification solutions for many, many years and is the clear leader in both leading-edge digital verification, with about 70% of advanced designs utilizing Synopsys, and circuit simulation, where 19 of the top 20 semiconductor companies rely on us.", "Verification is rapidly evolving, as chip complexity moves into its next phase. Two principles remain. Tool performance is key, and a complete home solution is increasingly a must. Today, our VCS simulator and ZeBu emulator both have the fastest run time in their respective categories. In combination with virtual prototyping and our FPGA-based prototyping system, we cover the entire hardware/software verification space. With the addition of the most comprehensive open debug system, Verdi, and our next-generation verification IP offering, we now address the entire verification market with outstanding tools.", "During the quarter, we delivered the first product's release of Verdi under Synopsys. The first is an aggressive roadmap of advanced SoC debug technology. Our integration is progressing very well, and customer reactions to our complete verification solution have been very positive.", "The third area I would like to highlight is IP and systems, which represents about 1/4 of our revenue and continues to see strong business. Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world, with 1,700 engineers designing commercial IP blocks, that give us the #1 position in interface, embedded memories and analog IP.", "According to Gartner, Synopsys is the largest provider of physical IP, more than double the nearest competitor. We expect this area of our business to continue to yield double-digit growth. Top 20 semiconductor vendors continue to outsource more IP to Synopsys, trusting us to deliver high-quality blocks into their critical chips. The amount of IP these companies consume has increased by 5x over the past few years and now represents almost half of our DesignWare IP revenue.", "This quarter, we also surpassed our 3,000th USB design win. Last year, our USB solutions shipped well in excess of 500 million units. And finally, our PCI Express solutions are well ahead of the competition. We are approaching 1,000 wins in our PCI Express family and recently passed compliance with 20-nanometer silicon.", "In systems, we had our strongest bookings quarter ever for FPGA-based prototyping, with broad-based demands by some of the largest semiconductor and systems companies in the world. The promise of earlier development of software, as well as robust hardware/software verification is driving continued demand for our outsourced solution.", "In automotive, as software content and complexity continue to grow, our customers are taking advantage of our leading virtual prototyping technology, so they can start their software development earlier and accelerate system integration, test and validation.", "Finally, our partnership with ARM continues to bear fruit as we released an ARM Cortex-A57-based virtual design kit, enabling our customers to create software for ARMv8-based designs up to 1 year before silicon is available.", "In summary, as we reach the halfway point of the fiscal year, Synopsys continues to execute very well. Demand for technology is strong, customer momentum continues, and we again delivered very solid financial results. Consequently, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q3 and the full year. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in February. Q2 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. In addition, the revenue run rate is positive.", "Now some additional detail. Total revenue was $499 million, an increase of 15% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was greater than 4 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal. As a result, we now expect average duration for fiscal 2013 to be greater than 3 years.", "Turning to expenses. Q2 total GAAP costs and expenses were $420 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16 million of stock-based compensation. Q2 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $365 million, an expected year-over-year increase, due primarily to increases in headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the quarter and 26% for the first half of fiscal 2013. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed towards the second half of the year. This is simply due to timing of expenses, such as employee compensation, some hiring that shifted to the second half and traditionally higher Q4 expenses.", "However, for all of FY '13, we're still on track to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points over FY '12 levels. Our ongoing goal continues to be a focus on operational efficiency, with annual operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.44. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $0.66, slightly exceeding our target range, driven by expenses at the lower end of guidance and higher-than-expected other income. We are raising our annual EPS guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results and our confidence in the rest of the year.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter, and we continue to think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit for FY '12 and '13. As a reminder, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit has an impact of approximately $0.09 to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings.", "Turning now to our cash and balance sheet items. During the quarter, we generated $134 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $375 million to $400 million. We paid back $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $120 million. We also purchased 1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $35 million, and have approximately $237 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $681 million, with 39% onshore and 61% offshore. We'll continue to optimize the use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.", "DSO declined 6 days sequentially to 46 days, and we ended Q2 with 8,195 employees with about 1/3 in lower-cost geographies.", "Now let's address our third quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $475 million and $485 million, a year-over-year increase of 8% at the mid-point. As a reminder, we do expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue going forward, driven by factors such as growing hardware business in emulation and prototyping, but continue to expect a 90% time-based revenue model. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $411 million and $428 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $365 million and $375 million; other income and expense between $1 million and a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% to 25%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.28 to $0.34 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.53 to $0.55 per share; and we expect about 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.", "Now our fiscal 2013 outlook. Revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14%, excluding the extra week in 2012. We've been able to maintain our revenue targets even in the context of the yen depreciation this year. Other income and expense between $5 million and $9 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.56, which includes the impact of approximately $67 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.42, which represents solid, double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of $375 million to $400 million.", "So in summary, we're pleased with our strong Q2 financial performance and continued execution, which was highlighted by top and bottom line growth and solid operating margin. We're also pleased to provide increased EPS and cash flow guidance for FY '13.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Brian, just a question with respect to one of the comments you made. I think you said the revenue run rate was positive on the quarter, and I wondered if that also applied to the bookings run rate versus the prior years on average.", "Brian M. Beattie", "That's in fact how we do measure the revenue run rate, and so we're looking at the bookings and compare that to the beginning of the year, looking at revenue that we'd be expecting to get in the deals as we go forward.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So that exactly is your sort of standard measure of run rate?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and that was positive on -- in aggregate. And then, Aart, just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the IP business, which is clearly a big focus and a nice growth driver for you guys. Want to try to understand where the margin of that business is today. I believe it's below the corporate average. But where you see it today and where you see it going? And does that require any meaningful upfront investment for the move to FinFET, to sort of crank out all the different FinFET versions of these products which, obviously, you would benefit from down the road?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Okay. In general, that business is strong and we have continued our push to improve its profitability, at the same time balancing it, I think, well, with the amount of continued investment in creating the products available for next year. The good news is on the FinFET side, we have actually invested already quite a while ago. And so I think we're going to start to see the benefits of that, as the early investments will start to turn now into growing revenue from that. So I actually see it as a very positive outlook for that business.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And with respect to the Intel renewal, a couple of questions. First, was it really exclusively the Intel deal that drove up the average duration for the quarter? Were the -- was the rest of the business kind of in line with your norm? And two, would have thought that, all things equal, your deferred revenue would have gone up sequentially with that renewal in the quarter, but it actually went down a bit. Just wondering if you could comment on those couple of items.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, as you know, in general, we are very shy to comment about anything regarding a specific customer, and that includes Intel. Needless to say, this is an important customer for us and a significant agreement. Let me not break it out further, given that we really don't want to comment about the specifics of the transaction.", "Brian M. Beattie", "And to your question on deferred revenues, Rich, just recall that increases in deferred revenue happen only when we're able to invoice the customers.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "So could I take it that maybe you didn't yet invoice for that particular large deal?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Same comment in terms of providing, we don't provide the details of the individual accounts.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "And I understand you don't want to provide the duration of that specific deal, but can you say if we should be expecting any change in duration going forward? Any other -- whether -- any other change in your average duration other than that one deal?", "Brian M. Beattie", "What we do is look at the total weighted average renewal lengths that we've been able to close in the quarter. And the impact, as we said, for Q2 was that it became greater than 4 years, and then the impact, as we look at bookings perspectives for all of FY '13, will be just over 3 years as well.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "There are a few of them. Aart, in the past, you have spoken about growing your IP business in the double-digit range, or the low-double digits. Is this still the target for this year? And can you talk a little bit around the competition now that Cadence has Tensilica?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, we have not changed our outlook. We think that this is a part of our business that is growing in double-digit range. We foresee it to continue to be there. And of course, at any point in time, we're dealing with a variety of competitors. And I think that is more an indication that it's a healthy business than anything else.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it, all right. And then, on the emulation side of the market, after you guys purchased EVE, can you talk about what kind of trends you're seeing there? I know that everyone believes in it being a secular grower. Are there any cyclical trends within that, because 2 of your competitors have 2 different views, at least for this year on how the emulation revenue is going to trend? And along the same path, when I look at your operating margin or the margin profile, you're going to improve your margins in IT business. How was the margins on the emulation business? And where do you think it can get to?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, let me go backwards. We actually do not break out the margins of any of the individual businesses, partially because there are some fluctuations as we decide to invest or not. The key objective, of course, is to manage the overall profitability of the company to be in line with our even higher-level objective, which is to grow the earnings per share in high-single-digit range. And so all of this fits together nicely in that regard. As we look at EVE particularly, we are now in the very interesting phase of integrating it, while we simultaneously are integrating the debugging capability acquired from SpringSoft. And so our aim and objective is really to now take what is a fabulous collection of really best-in-class technologies and deliver a well-thought-out integrated platform. And EVE absolutely is a key piece in that. And so far, I think that's going very, very well.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then the final question, on the FinFET side, clearly, you guys have a lot of experience on the FinFET design. When you contracted [ph]  the foundries, most foundries are expected to start manufacturing FinFET-based chips some time next year. I don't think there's any specific timing quite yet. But when you look at it, is the challenge in FinFET more on the design side? Or do you think its more on the manufacturing side?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I don't want to be not humble and say, \"Well, it is hindsight. We have it sort of under control.\" But the reality is I think it is both, meaning that these are new structures that are simultaneously being introduced with much, much smaller nodes. So that's sort of squaring the complexity of the problem and simultaneously achieving much higher density of transistors, which brings a lot of challenges for the tools. The only reason that I speak with, I think, a fairly high degree of confidence is we have already helped customers tape out chips that are on the market today with this technology. And in that sense, the proof of concept is beyond concept, that is absolutely in production. Now having said that, there's no question that there are multiple players that are all racing forward to deliver their own version of this technology, and that requires adjusting to their specific technologies, adjusting to how they would like to see the designs come together. And we are extremely engaged in -- with all of them, which, from my perspective, is a really, really positive sign because I think that FinFET is one of the enablers for truly a next generation, meaning a decade or so, of advanced design. And I think this is moving at super high speed.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering if we could approach it this way, if you take out your largest couple of deals, was the duration of the rest of the contracts below 3 years or above 3 years.", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think, let's not go too much into trying to reverse engineer all the numbers. Fundamentally, our business has not changed. And in aggregate, we have always said that the balance of transactions that we do is in the 3-year range. In the last few quarters, it was a bit lower. Before that, it was a little higher. But fundamentally, there's nothing that would indicate to me that our business is changing. Everything else, I think, we're not going to go into further, if you don't mind. Thank you.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And what year -- as we think about the collections through the year, you do have a seasonality to it. Given the increase in cash flow for the year, would you say that your second half collections are going to be above seasonal as compared to the past?", "Brian M. Beattie", "You're right on it. They're typically higher in the third quarter. That's what we've seen every year and still expect then, we have a second half which is stronger than the first half. And with the confidence we had and the business activity, we had increased confidence in cash flow, primarily around collections. And so that is looking better for this year and allowed us to raise guidance.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You mentioned the FX impact. You've been able to hold the revenue guidance. As you look at the pipeline for the back half of the year, is there any concentration in terms of either bookings in the pipeline or other that we should think about being -- coming out of Japan?", "Brian M. Beattie", "I think let's just align on the question. It's really a perspective for foreign exchange, is that we typically hedge off all the expenses as we operate around the world. But in this past 6 months or so, we have seen a notable devaluation in the yen. It affects the revenues, most of the revenues out of Japan, not all of them. And as we look for the year, we've been able to offset that impact. We have not had a material impact to any of the key line items, in particular, in terms of earnings per share, and just been able to offset that with good operational performance. We've been able to hold our revenues for the year. And just good hedging, the natural hedging, and managed it to have a very minimal impact to the year and even allowed us to raise guidance. So this year has been very good from a yen perspective. We typically don't have any fluctuations to the budgets we set for the year because of all these programs that I just went through. And at the end of the day, with Japan and the economy is expected to pick up as a result of this devaluation in the long run, we think that's good for our customers as well.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right, great. Last question, Aart, can you just kind of maybe characterize where we are in the transition? It seems like 20-nanometer might be a little bit of a transition node. Do you agree with that? And kind of where are we in the move to the next big node in terms of tooling?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we are definitely seeing the number of designs growing in the 20-, 22-nanometer node. I concur with the general feel of somewhat of a transition from 28 to 14, 16. And the reason that's a little bit of a misnomer is because the transition to FinFET is actually the important driver, not necessarily the node size, although the 2, of course, interact. And the reason the transition to the FinFET is so enticing is that it really changes the performance power nature of the transistor, and that has been one of the increasing or the difficult bottlenecks in semiconductors. And so, that being the opener to a next volley, so to speak, the race is obviously on. But it is also fair to say that a number of customers will land, at least temporarily, on the 22 -- 20-, 22-nanometer just because they want to pipe-clean their design flow, they want to sort of minimize the risk in the transitions, and that makes a lot of sense. But we definitely see both behaviors.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Brian, looking at the operating or, I guess, the margin expansion, the 100 basis points this year perhaps a little bit more in the out year. Is that driven by kind of the ramping IP and better margins in IP? Or just an overall revenue growth in the company that's driving the operating margin expansion?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, Tom, it's all of the above. It's really that our revenues are up very nicely this year. We're looking at revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Spending is not growing as fast as that, and we are seeing good improvements across the board in the operating margins of the company. At the same time, we've got to retain dollars to invest in leading-edge technologies. So again, still on track for the commitment for the year to see approximately 100-basis-points improvement in the margins.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And when you look at the -- all the acquisitions last year, is there an opportunity to have operating expense improvements as integration happens over the next few quarters? Or are we pretty much at the ongoing level at this point?", "Brian M. Beattie", "So there's still, in a number of the product lines, still some of the integration activities underway, getting best-in-class performance features out of all of the various products and bringing those to market as quickly as we can. So again, there could be some opportunities there. But again, overall, the company does need to stay invested in leading-edge technologies and continue to drive EPS at the same time.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And what was the actual impact of the yen over the -- during the quarter?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Really not very material at all. As you saw from an impact through the yen on the revenues because of our hedging and the other activities and overachieving, as well as other income and expense, where we are able to recognize some of the non-hedge accounting impacts to the company. So bottom line to the company was really minimal, nothing almost.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then you talked about tax rate of 23%. That includes the, I guess, the $0.09 impact of the R&D tax credit already?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, it does.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "It's already embedded in your guidance.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Absolutely, yes, that's factored in. We -- that came through in our first quarter. There was about $0.04 impact related to FY '12 as a retro catch-up that we had in Q1. And then, we had forecast an additional $0.05 to come through in earnings per share for the balance of FY '13 which, again, we're just building on. So we saw the $0.09 increase in Q1, primarily coming from tax, and then we're adding on another $0.02 improvement in EPS coming from operational improvements this quarter.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And your long-term view without the tax credit going forward in the out-years is still that 25%?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, at 25% to 26%. Because when you look at, I said 23%, it's a roughly 3 percentage points change. So 25% to 26% is a good, long-term planning model for us.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess, just finally, on the technology side, is the move to some of these advanced technologies for memory, like the 3D NAND, are they big drivers as well? It sounds like FinFET and the fact that the fabless guys are, in conglomerate, all of your biggest customers per se. Are you going to see much of an impact once the industry moves to some of these other memory technologies?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Oh, absolutely, although they're not completely linked. And there's a key reason for that, which is that the largest portion of the industry that has -- that sees the biggest benefit in changing the performance power segment is clearly the mobile side of the industry. Now the power equation is starting to impact the cloud side as well, because these very large centers of servers are heavily eating up too much power. But that's going to be a little slower. So mobility is driving this, and mobility is just incredibly hunger for -- hungry for even more performance. We're essentially limited by battery power. And since most of the computational energy goes into the core processors, that is where the emphasis on FinFET is going to be first. Now memories are following their own track of technology development, but they have the very same need of being very, in this case, being very, very price sensitive. And so we are going to see more and more push there, as well, in parallel to the processors. By the way, when I say processors, I should clarify that I mean not just the apps processors, but any other form as well. The graphics processors are key, the DSP processors as well.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And so once you guys -- it really comes down to just battery life as the main driver of the mobile consumer today.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes. In many ways, largely because I think battery improvements, and don't quote me on the number, but I think is maybe in the 10% to 15% per year, which is woefully insufficient versus what we wish our phone could do. And therefore, I think any advances in semiconductors are going to be of very high value. And by the way, I think this is going to continue in years to come because the demand for more compute power will, if nothing else accelerate with the type of applications that are possible. Therefore, over time, I certainly have hopes that we will see some more migration of capital and money flow into the semiconductor industry, precisely because there's such a high leverage on being able to improve the performance power ratio of a number of these chips.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Brian, to start with you, just to reconcile some revenue numbers here. You had an unusually large increase in your Asia-Pacific revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, but your upfront revenues declined sequentially by a fair amount. So was the increase in Asia Pac largely tied to the increase in TBL revenues generally? And was IP and/or services the main driver to that increase in Asia Pac?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes. Let's go through a couple of your points here. One is that APAC did have a very strong quarter and, when we look at trailing 12 months, is doing very, very well as well, so a very strong region for the company. In terms of the mix of products, of course, it fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. When we look at -- now that, of course, we have an increased hardware business, we have more business coming in the areas of percentage completion or milestone-based accounting for our revenues. And also, that we see from time to time, royalty is coming through in a quarter-to-quarter basis. So there will be some natural fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. And I don't link it specifically to the region but, overall, for the company. But APAC is very strong for us, and looking at very strong year-over-year growth.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So just to clarify on that, so it was a variety of things. It wasn't necessarily a single, large, scheduled TBL payment or anything like that.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Right, that's correct.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. For Aart, let's see how far we can take the Intel discussion. When you last publicly disclosed a renewal with them, which was August 2007, there were some comments you made at the time with regard to technology collaboration and work with them. So perhaps you could comment in what ways the arrangement now might, in any way, be different from what you talked about back then. Also at that time, in 2007, your quarterly revenue run rate with them that you disclosed was roughly, let's call it, $34 million a quarter. Now based on recent disclosures, you're up to over $50 million a quarter. Some of that's inorganic, of course, but would you foresee a prospect of further material increases in the run rate with them as we've seen over the last 5 to 6 years?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, if nothing else, Jay, you're keeping very good notes. But unfortunately, I'm not going to add much to the notes because we don't comment about the business relationship with -- we have with our customers. Intel is obviously, visibly so, an important technology driver and has been a very good partner to us, and all I can say is that, that relationship continues on that basis.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. On the IP business, I think you've mentioned in an earlier call that you have something like 1,400 engineers now in that business. Could you just remind us what proportion of that headcount is inwardly focused in terms of R&D versus customer engagements where you're doing projects for customers that -- apart from the internal R&D work that you do?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, the number I mentioned was 1,700. And I'm not quite sure how to answer the question because these are engineers that are essentially developing IP for customers. Some of the IP is very generic. Some of the IP gets tuned specifically for the customers' technology. And whenever an IP is not fully synthesizable, you have to do that in order to take advantage of the specific nature of their silicon node. And the node is not only single node, it often has different characteristics being optimized for performance or low power, for example. And so the breadth of the type of these engagements is quite broad, but the number I mentioned is all really fundamentally in the development and delivery of IP to the customer.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, a couple of last things. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you had a win in Japan. Could we speak about Japan a little bit more broadly? Because it's been obvious for the last number of years that it's been shrinking in importance to EDA as a percentage of EDA spend. And yet we've seen, in the last couple of quarters or so, some renewed momentum among other technical software companies. And I'm wondering if this particular win is indicative of all. Are they a reinvestment cycle that may be occurring in Japan vis-\u00e0-vis EDA as a whole and not just this one particular success that you've had there?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Just for the record, I did not mention any specific win in Japan. But on the general topic of Japan, it is very clear that over the last -- no, actually, more than a decade, but visibly so in the last half decade or so, that the Japan economy and the semiconductor industry, in particular, have been under enormous pressure, while we, as a company, are doing quite well. I'd like to link to one of the things that Brian said earlier, which is this very change in the valuation of the yen is viewed in Japan as at least the beginning of a ray of hope that they become more competitive on a worldwide basis. And with that, the opportunity for their business to sort of restart themselves beyond the somewhat stale situation that the industry has been in. Now having said that, there are a number of companies that have taken very aggressive steps in consolidating or in streamlining their businesses. And like any other part of the world, these changes are difficult to do. They take some time. But after a while, they -- the positive impact starts to show. So we certainly hope that the industry in Japan, in semiconductors, will grow again and potentially also refocus on some of the newer opportunity spaces. And the indications are a little bit better than they were, actually, just 6 months ago. But having said that, these are macroeconomic events that are certainly far beyond our control as a company.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, would you care to comment on the announcement earlier this week by Cadence of a potentially competitive offering versus PT?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, of course, this is DAC season. And you will see a wave of announcements of products that are all better than what was ever built before, and the reality will sink in over time. So no, I don't think that there's anything more to be said right now. We will have to see what the reality is. And obviously, we have a strong competitor in Cadence, and we will compete equally strongly back.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, can you comment on the design win you talked about this quarter you had was -- which product area that was in and what was the driver for your design win?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, I think, I mentioned the term design wins when summarizing how far our USB franchise and delivery had gone. Because it's quite astounding how the IP business for us has evolved over a number of years. And sometimes, we work so hard that we don't realize how many designs have actually utilized our IP. And in that context, I think the 3,000th design win of USB was actually, I think, quite remarkable. Having said that, the other aspect where there were design wins comes in is literally every day, meaning that no matter how good a company we hope we are, we have to prove every day again that we're worthy of the responsibility of being on the top chips for tomorrow. And therefore, we do have a very active engagement in the field through our technical support team. And the good news is, I think we are really massively involved in all the new advanced chips. And in that context, every day, there's, somewhere in the world, some good news of being selected again to continue that journey. But it's also the responsibility and the fun challenge to actually have to deliver on chips that are driving the boundaries of what we can do. And so in that context, I think the FinFET efforts, be it through the tools that are very much on top of it, I think already, the IP that is in very rapid development and now, increasingly, the technical skills in our field to support our customers, these are all very positive indicators for the future that we have with the people driving the most important design wins.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And just a follow-up on the FinFET. You mentioned that you have experience designing with FinFET. Can you give us a little bit more color, where is the more profound impact in terms of the different tools? Is it more in the device simulation or placement or power closure? Where is the most profound changes you had to make in the tools to enable the FinFET?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good question. It's actually very much across the board, because it starts with really the design of both the technology, which, by the way, is moving to a very, very small node, 14-, 16-nanometer. And with that, there's a lot of lithography type of issues, but there's also lithography creeping into the place en route by virtue of what's called double-patterning. Secondly, the entire layout space is highly impacted, because the nature of the transistor will change the timing and power calculations. But the layout is also influenced greatly by all the rules that you have to follow to place these things on the chip just right. And when I say rules, we're talking essentially a doubling of rules of 2,000 to 4,000 rules that you have to follow. And then, indirectly, it really impacts, or it will impact, I should say, going forward the entire verification space. Because all the way down to the SPICE level, simulation of the transistor, all the way up to the sheer number of transistors, and therefore, complexity of chip verification from a functional point of view. So it is quite remarkable the breadth of it, but it's also quite rewarding because that is the very, very reason that we can see how much impact this will have on design and on electronics going forward. Then summarizing all of that, it also impacts every one of the building blocks. And again, you can look at the transistor as being literally the smallest atomic building block, all the way to the large pieces of IP that have to be tuned for these technologies. And as I mentioned in the context of an earlier question, we have been working on IP developments, be it in memories or libraries or building blocks, now already for quite a while. And in that sense, I think we are very much in sync with the foundries as they roll out their production-ready solutions.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then one more question I'd like to follow up on, the topic that was discussed, is the 20-nanometer being a transitory node. Will it be possible for you to give us a quantitative sense on what will be the -- what is your expectation for big design starts on 28, 20 and 14, so that we can get an idea for how big or how small this 20-nanometer is going to be?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, let me give you a little bit of sense. For the 28 -- 28-, 32-nanometer node, we actually have stopped tracking. And what that means is we count the early chips up until 500. After that, it becomes completely untrackable. And so that node, I think, will continue to be a big node in the sense that a lot of designs will aggregate there. On the 20-, 22-nanometer, we have, I think, about 100 designs and growing on the radar scope. And then we do not communicate the 14-, 16-nanometer, partially because there's too much confidential information in that. But I can only tell you that there are some very hard-driving folks engaged in both test chips and production chips there.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Farhan Ahmad", "This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of Satya. Question on the fragmentation in the foundry. Like, recently there's been some large companies which have indicated that they are entering the foundry space. Compared to 3, 4 years ago, there are more companies doing foundry works. How does that effect the EDA world? And does that imply that you have a greater amount of OpEx now needed because you have to support multiple design flows? And also, is that leading to more design activity because people have to design for different foundries?", "Aart J. de Geus", "To be honest, the -- acoustically, it was a little hard to understand. So let me try to formulate the question and see if I answer the right one, which is, as the foundry landscape is changing and a number of the foundries are -- and a number of their users are trying to use multiple foundries, what all do you have to support? Because in that context, the number of nodes sort of multiplies in the dark, so to speak, meaning that, not only do you have these smaller and smaller nodes, but you have variations on each one of those for performance, power and maybe cost. And so it is certainly true that this puts a fairly heavy burden on us, but also on the foundries, to have the complete ecosystem ready. And the good news on our side is that we have designed our tools to be extremely flexible for a variety of parameters. And therein lies actually one of the differentiating essences of what Synopsys has built, literally for the last 20 years, all the way starting to synthesis and through the physical implementation, which is we can read in the characteristics of different technology nodes and their variations, and then optimize the circuit based on that. And so if a certain node, let's say, may have some better capabilities in low power, we will take advantage of that automatically in the tools. Now having said that, the one area where the -- that is sometimes challenged is as you develop IP, that has to be individually optimized, in some cases, almost manually for best results because it's going to get reused so much. Now we need to have working contract with the customers so that we can invest the resources to do that, deliver it on time. And they have a strong interest that their IP looks really good because that will attract their customers to go to them. And so there's an economic relationship there that has to jive. And moreover, there's a temporal relationship because they want to have their technology ready at the same time as the tools being ready at the same time as the IP being ready and at the same time as the support being ready. And of course, you are talking about things that are really state-of-the-art. And so predicting the right arrival time is not always trivial. But we're working closely with, as I said, all of the top foundries on that. And again, I think it's both a privilege and an opportunity to be at the center of gravity of this whole next wave of capability.", "Operator", "And I'll turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, at this point in time, thank you for attending the call. I think we communicated to you that we had really an excellent quarter and, moreover, are making really great progress in many of the technology directions that, I believe, will profoundly impact semiconductors in the years to come. And so, from that perspective, as much as the pressure is on us to continue to deliver, the privilege is here to be part of that, right? And we're looking forward at finishing our year well within the targets that we've given you. Thank you so much, and we'll be available for questions afterwards as usual.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual risks -- actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risk that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the time to join us. Synopsys continues to perform very well and in Q3, we again delivered solid results in terms of business, technology and customers, meeting or beating every target we communicated last quarter. We achieved revenue of $483 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 and strong operating cash flow. For the year, we're raising non-GAAP EPS outlook to a range of $2.42 to $2.44, projecting excellent double-digit growth for the year. We're also raising our operating cash flow targets to approximately $400 million. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute.", "Before proceeding to the company highlights, let me comment on the customer landscape. For semiconductor companies, Q3 was yet another quarter with a relatively weak global economy, particularly in Europe, and with slightly reduced growth in Asia. While this landscape is not really new, the continued pressure quarter after quarter of this economic squeeze is challenging. Simultaneously, though, our customers have a high focus on new technology and aggressive design activity. The result is a relentless demand for advanced tools and IP, areas in which we continue to lead and have a strong track record of excellence.", "For our customers, high-impact EDA and IP are more differentiating than ever before, making deep collaboration with the right supplier crucial. Synopsys benefits from these trends, and our technology investments and acquisitions are paying off. This is evidenced in the closing of multiple large deals in the quarter, despite significant competitive battles. Superior quality and breadth of our portfolio, as well as the engagements of our highly skilled global support team helps us win the fought-over business.", "Looking at the continued technology evolution, Synopsys today enables the most advanced designs in the world. Be it design at the most innovative FinFET-transistor-based technology nodes or be it advanced design at more established nodes, customers rely on Synopsys whenever they want differentiation from their competitors. Fundamentally, their differentiation is achieved along the 3 axes of better, sooner and cheaper. By better, we mean chips that are faster and/or lower power and, in most cases, are both. By sooner, we mean earlier time-to-market, which involves every aspect of design, including the verification of hardware and software. And by cheaper, we mean chips that are smaller, denser and achieve higher yield in manufacturing. Needless to say, each of these dimensions competes with the others and really good tools, IP and support materially impact the overall results.", "This is also why the new type of vertical transistor called FinFET is so important. FinFETs are simultaneously faster, smaller and lower power, but they do require sophisticated tools and IP. Synopsys has taken a strong leadership position in enabling this promising wave of advanced design, and we see excellent adoption as companies are investing more aggressively in this direction than initially forecasted.", "To date, approximately 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation, and we're already engaged all the way down to 10-nanometer. This past quarter, we saw the number of designs at 20-/22-nanometer and 14-/16-nanometer increased notably. Except for some specialty approaches, all 14-/16-nanometer designs are 3D FinFET-based, and all key foundries are investing heavily to develop their FinFET processes, promising eager customers about 40% lower power consumption.", "Synopsys has been investing in FinFET enablement for half a decade, and we have at least a year head start over any competitor. Our complete solution addresses design challenges from the earliest stages of process design, transistor development and characterization, library and memory IP development, digital and analog/mixed-signal design and verification, all the way to complex IP cores and sophisticated global support. By now, we also benefit from production-proven tools and IP, with more than 100 million FinFET chips shipped, thus far, using Synopsys tools.", "During the quarter, we announced a number of customer and ecosystem partners successes, all the result of multi-year collaborations. TSMC, for example, certified our digital and custom design and verification solution for its 16-nanometer FinFET process. We also delivered a comprehensive design implementation solution for Samsung's leading-edge 14-nanometer FinFET process. And we announced UMC's first qualification tape-out in its 14-nanometer FinFET process, achieved using Synopsys tools.", "These are just the latest in a growing string of achievements, including the tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer low-power test chip. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of its successful collaboration history and the comprehensive capabilities throughout our portfolio.", "Another excellent example is FPGA provider, Achronix, standardizing on IP Compiler and IP Validator and taping out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based SOC using our tools.", "Now let me turn to verification, where technology leadership is just as important. Today, our digital verification is used in the vast majority of advanced designs, and 19 of the top 20 semiconductor companies use Synopsys circuit simulation. With smaller transistors, and thus more transistors on a chip, the need for massive amounts of verification continues to grow. This is why the quest for still faster simulation is essential to our strategy. In that context, our VCS simulator and ZeBu emulator both have the fastest run times in their category.", "Growing equally rapidly in importance is the need to simultaneously verify hardware and software. Our combination of emulation, FPGA-based prototyping and virtual prototyping is unique in its breadth and capabilities. This is an area for growth for us, and prototyping, specifically, has been strong for us all year. In the past, customers typically built and assembled complex FPGA boards in-house to complement their chip simulation and accelerate their hardware/software debugging. These efforts are increasingly being outsourced to us, and we're collaborating closely with some of the most advanced design companies in the world in this area.", "To fully increase the impact of all these verification technologies, we are substantially investing in integration around the Verdi debug system. As you may recall, we acquired Verdi through the acquisition of SpringSoft late last year. It is the gold standard open debug system used broadly across the world. I can report that not only is the product superb, but the integration, while an enormous task, is progressing well. A number of key customers are collaborating closely with us in setting long-term direction.", "Let me close with an update on our IP products, which continue to thrive and grow. Over the past 10 years, the use of third-party commercial IP has gone from experimental, to periodically used, to mainstream. In parallel, the complexity of our IP has evolved from simple cost-advantaged blocks, to a broad portfolio of all the main interface protocols, to now extremely complex state-of-the-art and rapidly evolving next-generation solutions. In addition, our team has also become extremely proficient in the advanced technologies around FinFETs, and we're heavily engaged in sub-20-nanometer libraries, memories and analog IP.", "According to Gartner, Synopsys is the largest provider of physical IP, more than double the nearest competitor. The amount of IP that the top 20 semiconductor vendors consume has increased by 5x over the past few years and now represents almost half of our DesignWare IP revenue. Overall, we're the second largest IP provider in the world, with about 1,900 engineers designing commercial IP blocks, giving us the #1 position in interface, embedded memories and analog IP. We estimate that only about 50% of these types of blocks are outsourced today, and we expect this area of our business to continue to yield double-digit growth, driven more -- by more outsourcing as well as additional protocols and titles.", "In Q3, we released memory blocks for a number of 14-/16-nanometer FinFET processes, realized a key competitive win in interface IP and were chosen as the strategic IP partner by a large U.S. company for 16-nanometer FinFETs. Lastly, we also announced a new low-power IP subsystem for sensors, aimed at the \"Internet of things\" markets. This is an integrated, pre-verified system that sensor developers can purchase off the shelf rather than developing and assembling each component themselves.", "In summary, Synopsys continues to demonstrate broad strength and innovation in technology, customer relationships and financial execution. We delivered very solid financial results in the quarter, and as a result, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q4 and the full year. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "Now Synopsys delivered a solid quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in May. Additionally, we continued our stock repurchase program and generated considerable operating cash flow.", "Now some additional detail. Total revenue was $483 million, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Approximately 90% of the Q3 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for more than 10% of third quarter revenue.", "The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.9 years. We continue to expect average duration for FY '13 to be greater than 3 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal in Q2.", "Turning to expenses. Q3 total GAAP cost and expenses were $428 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16.5 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $375 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases in headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions, along with timing of quarterly expenses, including year-over-year cost increases, such as employee compensation and planned product investments.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5% for the quarter and 25% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our ongoing goal continues to be a focus on operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.33, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.55. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, below our target range due primarily to some onetime tax benefits that resulted from a true-up of our FY '12 taxes with the U.S. tax return that was filed just last month. As a result, we think that the non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13. And as a reminder, this rate reflects the reinstated R&D tax credits for both FY '12 and '13, which benefited FY '13 non-GAAP earnings.", "Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. During the quarter, we generated $263 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow targets for the year to approximately $400 million. And this is reflective of the higher-than-planned business levels and cash collections experienced throughout 2013. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $130 million. During the quarter, we purchased about 1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $35 million. During the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we spent $70 million, repurchasing about 2 million shares, and we have approximately $202 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $892 million, with 43% onshore and 57% offshore. We plan to continue optimizing use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.", "DSO was 53 days, reflecting the timing of invoices, and we ended Q3 with approximately 8,400 employees, with about 1/3 in lower-cost geographies.", "Now let's address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the fourth quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $500 million and $510 million, a year-over-year increase of 11% of the midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect some increased variability in quarterly revenues going forward, and this can be driven by factors, such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue, timing of consulting projects and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are received. However, we continue to expect a quarterly revenue model that is approximately 90% time-based.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses between $432 million and $449 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $386 million and $396 million; other income and expense between $1 million a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% to 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.29 to $0.35 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share.", "Now our fiscal 2013 outlook shows revenues between $1.957 billion and $1.967 billion, a growth rate of 12% of the midpoint or 13%, excluding the extra week we had in 2012. We've been able to maintain our annual revenue growth targets even in the context of a significant yen depreciation this year due to our hedging programs and our stronger business levels.", "Other income and expense between $8 million and $10 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 to $1.57, which includes the impact of approximately $67 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.44, which represents solid, double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $400 million.", "So in summary, we're pleased with our solid Q3 financial performance and execution, highlighted by considerable cash flow generation and on-target operating results.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Brian, you referenced higher-than-planned business levels, yet you very slightly tweaked down your revenue guidance for the year. Is that just due to the, what you mentioned, sort of higher expected volatility around hardware sales and those timing of consulting deals?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, again, we are seeing very, very strong business levels, and we referenced that last quarter and again this quarter. And as a result of that, we're able to confirm a very solid revenue growth for the year. We're looking at about 12% right now. It's right within the range we set at the very beginning of the year. It's within the range that we set at the last quarter even. And as a result of that, too, we're now able to raise the midpoint of our EPS guidance by about $0.03 from last quarter. So again, we're in good shape. We're actually -- you see us now shooting for over $500 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, which is a record achievement for us as well that we're planning.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe I can ask it another way. Were -- are there any geos or product areas that are a bit lighter than expected? And I guess I'd call out Japan, in particular, that's been down high-single digits to double digits for the last 3 quarters. Is that a headwind that's sort of had some cumulative impact here? And any thoughts on any of those?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, yes. We do see, as I mentioned, even last quarter, we anticipated the results we'd have this week -- this quarter. We do see some variability just based on the timing of the elements like our emulation hardware products and our boards, our prototyping activity, where all that revenues move within the quarter; so again, seeing very good, strong growth. The consulting part of the business is doing pretty well. And again, that timing of that is based on, Rich, either the percentage completion or when the cash comes in from the customers. So we just tune it into the actual expectations based on the type of business. But overall, looks like a very, very strong year again that we're putting up.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, one final one for me. With respect to your analog and custom design initiative, just wanted to talk about how that's going in the market, how the Laker product is doing. And that was a well-respected product but a very small revenue base relative to the total market. Wondering if you feel like you're having some success there in trying to crack into that sort of analog custom design market, based on those Laker tools.", "Aart J. de Geus", "As a matter of fact, yes, Laker was a very good acquisition, and the combination of Laker and the efforts that we had in CD are quite complementary, and we're still in the process of integrating all of that. But one of the other things that we inherited with Laker, of course, is a very strong presence with a number of customers. And while one goes through the uncertainties of an initial acquisition, I can report that the customers are very positive about what we're doing and have been very stable with us, so we can build on that. In addition, we're finding also that the ability to do code design with the obviously very strong digital offering that we have is growing in opportunity. So I think Laker was a great addition to what we have, and the integration is progressing very well with what is truly also a stellar team in the form of SpringSoft people.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I had a couple of them. One, Brian, on the guidance for the October quarter, what is the reason for the non-GAAP OpEx going up that much?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, the timing of the spending, again, is just based on when the agreements are put in place, and it's a profile that's recognizing salary increases that come in the year. There's little bit of variable comp related to, again, a very strong fourth quarter that's expected. So really, just a -- it's a typical Q4 profile that we see. We saw the same thing last year and then typically, the next quarter, in Q1, kind of drops off. So it really is just the tuning-up for all the final year expense activity.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. And then I have another question for you. When you look at the foundries moving to 20 and below on the FinFET side, I'm just kind of curious, can you help quantify what is the increase in design cost when you go from a 28- to a 20-nanometer planar? And then when you go from planar to 16 or 14 FinFET geometry, can you help quantify what the incremental design cost of that [ph] is?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, this is actually quite difficult because very often, people, as they move to the next node, and especially as they move into this one, they're simultaneously dramatically increasing the complexity of their chip. And so what they are trying to get is, for roughly what is the same manufacturing costs because those have tended to be relatively stable for many, many, many years, is a much higher degree of functionality. On top of that, what complicates your question is to what degree are they pushing the envelope on performance and power. And so those people that really want to exceed their competition in that angle will spend more with us, and we're clearly seeing that the first version of any design is a step-up in terms of investment, in terms of time and in terms of utilization of tools. I'm clarifying that it's first version, because there's a lot of wrong beliefs in the industry that every chip is just incredibly more expensive. That's not true. Once you've done the first version of a chip, most of the chips are derivatives, that then are much lower cost. So at the end of the day, the economic equation holds pretty well together, and the reason I can say that is because we can see the number of people accelerating their push towards the sub-20-nanometer FinFET generation to actually continue to increase. And I think that's a very good sign because, as you've heard me say before, I think FinFET has opened up another decade of Moore's Law, and we're well on our way with that.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But -- and then when you look at it historically, like maybe going back to the 28-nanometer node, what was the time from the time -- from the moment they finalized the design to the time they ramped up capacity? And do you expect that to be shorter when you go to FinFET because you said that you're accelerating to the FinFET node? Once they finalize the FinFET design, when do you expect actual volume output on factories to happen?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think that, in aggregate, it is not that different from any of the previous nodes. Because as much as the processing is a bit more complex, it does not add an enormous amount of time compared to previous processing steps. And so then it's more a question of what your degree of confidence in the quality of the designs, do you have to do any engineering changes to it and tape it out another time -- another round. And in general, so far the evidence is that we're doing just as well as we did with any of the previous generations, but it is a big investment for specifically the foundries to get all of their data together. One more comment, with these much larger chips, these chips are de facto little supercomputers because they have many processing cores, comes also an increase of the embedded software that goes with it. And so as much as your question is pertinent, I do think that the time-to-market is as much dominated by the readiness of the software as the issues around the hardware.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "I think the first question for Brian. Brian, if I look at 9 months, the revenue from Japan, it's almost down 10% year-over-year. Is it mainly due to the yen? Or you think either the semi spend or the EDA spend in the Japan is slowing?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, it's really a combination of that, Monika. For the first part, we do see the yen has devalued about 20% this year, and most of our revenues in Japan are in yen-denominated contracts. In addition to that, we're just looking at perspective on Japanese economy, which is fairly flat, and a lot of activity, of course, going on to encourage the activity levels and the investments to the government and so on to pick up the overall economic growth levels in Japan. So again, we expect that, that may bring us even better results next year.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then just kind of a follow-up, what we have seen in the semi industry right now, I mean, semi industry kind of is deep in challenge, as you kind of talked about in your opening remarks. So could you maybe talk about the impact of slowing to flat growth of semiconductor industry on the EDA industry?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Sure. So first and foremost, I think what happens in the semiconductor industry is largely governed by the external economy. And so, in that sense, that industry is not different than any others, except for the fact that new technology has an uncanny way of actually holding strong even in economic tough times. And I shouldn't just maybe call it tough, it's just sort of anemic for, now, a number of years. And so semiconductors are actually quite intense in terms of the investments. The growth rate, it keeps being projected as going up 6 months from now. But in all honesty, that's been now happening for, for a little while, but the investments continue to be very targeted. And so for our industry, the EDA industry, and I would say also some of the technology investments around manufacturing, investments have continued because the opportunity space going forward is extremely attractive as we enter this next round of silicon technology in transistor type. And we, Synopsys, have been fortunate to see this coming for a little while and, therefore, have invested heavily into it. And that's why I think we will continue to deliver a higher growth rate than the semiconductor industry for sure and, in general, have done quite well and certainly, our bookings have been strong again in that direction.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Then I have one on the cash and capital allocation. I mean, you guys have raised again your operating cash flow guidance. So have you thought about maybe initiating dividend?", "Aart J. de Geus", "We have shied away from that because we feel that, in our space, having options around M&A or buybacks is actually the better way to use the cash and that is what we've been doing for the last number of years. We never say no to anything, but at the same time, right now, our priorities are very clear. Our objective is to continue to grow the earnings per share, and we are doing that -- the -- all the mechanisms that we set, which is leadership in technology, invest there, invest in the support of our customers and then also manage the profitability of the company upwards and keep looking at opportunities to acquire technologies if they are ready and if they fit our profile.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And just the last one, if I may. You talked about the sensor IP. Could you maybe help me understand maybe more details on the sensor IP you talked about? Is it the interface IP for sensors or is it something else?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Certainly. Well, first, why is it important? Well, if you look at the Internet today, of course, this has been growing immensely in the last 15, 20 years mostly because of the connectivity first of people to people over the Internet and then major compute centers to other major compute opportunities over that same medium. What is clearly going to happen now is that for many things, and it's actually referred to as the \"Internet of things,\" there will be more and more connectivity provided, which is another way of saying that everyday objects will need some connectivity, will need some smarts [ph] , will need some memory and it will need to be connected via sensors to the physical reality. And so what we have provided is essentially a very, very well-integrated small set of IP blocks that are ready to be connected to sensors and that can be, in turn, integrated into a broader compute environment or communications environment. And thus, we're following our past strategy, which is provide the puzzle pieces that maybe others could build as well, but that can be more efficient -- efficiently acquired or outsourced to us.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Want to start with the upfront revenue. So the results of the quarter, was all of that attributed to the acquisition of EVE and the revenue recognition around that? Or was there other upfront contracts in the more traditional part of your business?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Sterling, it's really related to the hardware part of the business. All of our hardware transactions are enacted in the quarter, in which we shipped, and it's taken upfront, so that reflects that. And it was a very strong on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So that's what happened in Q3, and it came in pretty well as expected. And again, it's one of those items we've highlighted that may move from quarter-to-quarter just based on timing of the deals and when we actually are shipping the product but it's not ratable. It's right upfront.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And when you look at the contributions from the recent acquisitions, can you at least qualitatively characterize how they performed? And can you talk us through, was there any impact on deferred revenue from the acquisitions?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, maybe on the last part, no. No impact on deferred revenue. That's just business as usual. Everything was fully integrated for all of the acquisitions last year, were integrated at the very beginning of the year. So balance sheets and everything reflected that. And so the quarter-to-quarter swings in deferred revenues, which, as you know, just reflects the ability to invoice customers. And where we haven't taken revenue, there's no significant change in that profile year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter.", "Aart J. de Geus", "On the integrations, I think things are actually progressing extremely well. We're happy with all the acquisitions that we made. And there's, of course, a lot of work to integrate them, largely because the acquisitions were made with the broader vision in mind. And specifically, if you look at even SpringSoft, the broader vision has been clearly around providing a much more sophisticated verification environment that would not only contain more multiple engines, so our simulator's an engine, but so is EVE, so are some of the FPGA prototyping that we have and so on. And it connects all of those to a common debugger, which is the Verdi debugger. I think that vision is turning out to be right on and has connected very, very well with a number of our most advanced customers. The other part, of course, that was mentioned briefly earlier is that there was also an analog/mixed-signal set of capabilities that came with SpringSoft, and that team has aligned very, very well with the team that we already have in that domain. And maybe the third one to mention, because it was also done last year, is Magma. There are 2 -- in the last 2 quarters, and specifically also this quarter, we saw excellent progress with a number of formerly key customers of Magma to now really align strongly with where we're going in our implementation flow on the new technologies. And so I think those transitions towards a common set of company products, all in all, are progressing very well. And the hard metric, of course, is, is that what's happening with the customers? And the answer is yes. The customers are very much following our vision there.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, last one. I want to go back to the point you made about business momentum. You sounded very positive on it, but I wanted to just connect some dots here. You had DSOs that jumped 7 days quarter-over-quarter. You've got the jump in OpEx expected in the fourth quarter, partly in your comment about variable expenses, because you're expecting strong bookings in the fourth quarter, and the revenue forecast for October is below consensus. If I put that all together, perhaps one theory is going to be, you had a back-end-loaded quarter this quarter and a number of yields pushed into the fourth quarter, where you're not going to get a full coverage worth of revenue recognition, that's why the revenue guide is where it is. I just want to throw that out there, so you can talk to it, so we can just tell if that's not the right way to connect those dots.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, just to be clear, the way I look at it is from a very different perspective, which is we are running the company, first on a yearly basis and secondly, sort of backwards from earnings per share. And so whenever we look at how these different things flow, our key objective is to not execute -- not only execute within the guidance that we've been giving, but hopefully, even better than guidance if the external business picture allows for that. It has done so this year. Obviously, we have one quarter to go. But as you know, we have a pretty good sense of where we can land in a given quarter. And so all of the comments that you've made are all variables that are being tuned as we end the year. And right now, overall, we'll do a substantially better than what we had set at the beginning of the year. And most of our focus right now has to be, therefore, on FY '14 and '15. And that is really where most of our planning work is going. So again, the emphasis is on the earnings per share. All the other variables are important, but they sort of have to fall in line just like the puzzle pieces over an overall picture.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of financial questions for Brian to start and then a couple on the industry for Aart. Brian, could you connect the dots as well with regard to the sequential drop in your core EDA business plus a fairly substantial drop in Asia-Pac versus Q2 and as well as the sequential drop in your TBL revenues from Q2? Is that all correlated? And then similarly, going back to Sterling's question about the upfront revenue, you had a fairly large sequential increase in your cost of license revenue from the second quarter. Was that more closely connected to a increase or strength in your HAPS prototyping business that have -- might have been connected to the emulation business?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes. Okay, let me tackle all those questions. When we look at both the Q2 to Q3 profile, you're -- you sort of triangulating on a number of points related to specific contracts with specific customers. So for example, on the TBL line, as we had expected back in second quarter, we knew that there were certain elements related to both deliveries, cash collections from customers and so on that would have projected revenues in Q3 to come down a little bit from what we saw in Q2. That came through exactly, in effect, and that account was in the Asia-Pacific region. So sort of triangulating on your points about TBLs and then the Asia-Pacific. And then as we had indicated last quarter and this quarter, you are going to see a little bit of movement there based on either the hardware variables or the other elements that come in to services, which are up very nicely year-over-year. That's based on percentage completion, when we actually make the deliverables or milestones for that effect. But nonetheless, still maintaining 90% of each quarter's revenue coming from the backlog and being time-based. So it's just as we expected, as it came through, as it's profiled now in the Q3 is totally aligned. Your second question was about a COGS increase in Q3, and it was at $85 million and it was $77 million from a year ago. So that part there primarily related to the hardware deliveries, which I'd indicated with Sterling, was also up very nicely on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So that was where you'll see that movement from COGS for the cost of the hardware product that we delivered in the quarter. It was up very nicely.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Right. But I was asking if it was more correlated to the prototyping business, which, Aart mentioned in his prepared remarks, was strong through the year versus the EVE business.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, I'd agree with the first part. It's -- the extra strength came through the prototyping side.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Aart, the latest industry data would suggest that the big 3 EDA vendors have reached a new level of concentration or percentage of total EDA revenue, let's call it around 80% versus roughly 75% that the big 3 shared for many, many years. Do you see that as having any effect in terms of pricing or other business effects by virtue of you're now having a more concentrated EDA supplier base? And by the same token, do you see the customer base potentially offsetting that by themselves becoming more concentrated?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, for starter, if I may change the premise a little bit. We have already, for a number of years, started to look at ourselves as not at all limited by the traditional definition of EDA and much more look at the entire space of chip design. And a good example for the benefit of looking at it that way is clearly what we can see happening both on the side of the IP business growth as well as all the areas that we touched where there's hardware/software and, by the way, also in some of the manufacturing area. And so as much as we often get lumped, of course, within the traditional core EDA space, and we're sort of lacking to find the right terminology how we want to describe ourselves, our business space is actually quite large. And in that context, I think we have a lot of opportunities. Now having said that, I think we have competitors. We never underestimate them, and we can hope that they have good, healthy growth and no need to compete in ways that are not good for the market. But I've very little to say about that. Our objective is to keep growing our bottom line. And so far, I think we're well on track with that.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "All right. Since you brought up the issue of a broader view of the market, let me refer back to your presentation at the conference in Austin 2 months ago where you spoke fairly broadly about the role or value of EDA, and you put it in the context of application, customers' applications -- your customers' applications relative to the cost of electronics, which are presumably becoming less significant. Could you put that in the context of how all of that, that very broad vision you talked about, informs your product strategy or your market strategy, particularly for emerging markets in terms of automotive electronics and other market? How do you translate that very broad thing you talked about 2 months ago into your product and market strategy, particularly in terms of the specific verticals?", "Aart J. de Geus", "It's a great question because it's a difficult question. And it's a difficult question because, on one hand, one needs to have a clear understanding as to where the entire industry is going. And one of the key drivers motivating in that specific speech was to highlight the fact that with absolutely another decade of Moore's Law ahead of us, we will see such tremendous capability changes that is actually hard to predict all the applications, but it's not hard to predict that it will impact many fields very fundamentally. And for an earlier question half an hour ago on the \"Internet of things,\" that's just one aspect of that. But one can also talk about all the aspects of how it will touch the health industry. You mentioned automotive. In maybe somewhat flippant terms, there will be more smarts brought to individual tasks and individual objects in the world. Now that's easy to say, and then how do you make next quarter, and that's called the running of a company like Synopsys. And so the way we translate this is to understand where the long-term trends are. Understands that even if we may understand these very well, they're always very difficult to predict from a timeline point of view, but it is very useful to say, well, any action that we take, how is it helping out existing customers? How can we make it as adjacent as possible, adjacency in technology, adjacency in channel? Adjacency in terms of the customer makeup and thus, expand the serviceable market for us; and a TAM that I think is actually quite broad, depending on how you define it. And so in that context, we do have a number of bets in the water, and we have also a number of them that are seeing strong traction. As you well know, one of those bets was the moving into IP and that is over 10 years ago. And today, it is -- it's an engine that has a lot of growth potential with it. You now see that we are broadening those solutions, adding more hardware and software. And so, it is always a balance between long-term vision and day-to-day execution, and I think we are in a very, very good position because the core of our technology is absolutely exactly where the semiconductor customers need us to be. And they continue to bet on us for all the difficult work.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, just continuing on that theme, can you talk about, again, most specifically, what your expectations for the long-term growth are for that core EDA and IP business? And in that context, how do you feel about the next year? Is it going to be a typical year? Or do you see something different next year?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we want to refrain to give guidance now for next year. As you know, we do that in the fourth quarter. I think that, fundamentally, our view of the market that we're in has not changed. The core EDA is stabler for us and in the mid-single-digit growth range. The IP is in the double-digit growth range. And on average, as you know, we tend to sort of predict the year as a balance of those 2 things, and I'm refraining to give guidance for '14 right now. That has fundamentally not changed. At any point in time. We have things that go through growth spurts and others that need to be revamped, and that's something different this year, I think, than any other year. I think we're in a -- really a very strong and solid position.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's fair. And in terms of emulation, you talked about that. Where do you see -- what kind of contribution do you see from that particular business? And can you talk about -- a little bit about the competitive landscape in that business?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, for us, emulation actually, just like any of the other tools in verification, is no longer viewed as a standalone point tool. We are very much focusing everything we do on a verification solution, and the reason for that is simple. As much as we'll push on every one of our teams to be at the point tools [ph] , state of the art and best in class, the reality is our users use this tools in the context of very complex systemic verifications, where you pass certain portions of the design to one tool, certain portions in another tool. You need more accuracy. You need more speed. You balance these things. And what is great about the EVE acquisition is that it fits very well in the picture that we were building and, augmented by the Verdi debugger, really now complements our offering to be not only very complete but to have state-of-the-art point tools. But our objective is really to integrate those into an overall outstanding solution. We're well on our way, but there's still quite a bit of work to be done there. And so I think that FY '14 will really be the year where we will have a lot of real messaging around verification.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, Brian, you talked about the FX impact of the yen, but wondering if you could actually quantify what the revenue impact year-to-date has actually been because of the yen headwind.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Yes, we've indicated that again, in Japan, most of those contracts are yen denominated. We haven't broken out all the details on a line by line, but it is noticeable as a nonmaterial impact up to the revenue line. We've seen some improvement during the year from the hedging program that was booked through other income and expense. And when it flows through to the bottom line of 2013, it's really non-material to the EPS as well, just based on a very conserved hedging business. And the rest of it is just offset by a lot of hard work by all the different business units. So we've got recognizing what we had on our hands in 2013 and overall coming through, netting out in terms of revenues here that are right on track with what we said at the very beginning of the year despite some of that devaluation, looking at earnings, which are up about 16% overall for the year as well. So again, we just have to offset it. It's one of the many things that you have to deal with in running the business, and we're happy to deal with our results for the company.", "Operator", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back all to you, speakers, for any closing remarks.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, thank you for attending this session. I hope that the picture that emerges is one of excellent results and a strong confidence based on the technology position that we have. And as usual, we are open to your calls right after this.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Rochelle. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release.", "All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today.

I'm happy to report that we closed a very good quarter and achieved excellent 2013 results. We're seeing strong product and customer momentum, and we're positioned well as we head into 2014.", "Summarizing our results, we delivered revenue of $505 million in Q4 and $1.962 billion for the fiscal year, a 12% increase over 2012. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 and $2.44 for the year. This is 16% growth over fiscal 2012 and substantially above the target range communicated at the beginning of the year. Simultaneously, we increased our non-GAAP ops margin to 24% for the year and generated $497 million in operating cash flow. With strong multiyear commitments by a number of key customers, we grew our 3-year backlog to $3.1 billion. Lastly, we continued to diversify and broaden our product portfolio, with strong momentum in IP and Systems.", "Building on a very solid year-end position, we're setting a 2014 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.55 to $2.60 and a revenue target of $2.06 billion to $2.085 billion. Brian will discuss these in more detail shortly.", "Before providing some highlights for the year, let me comment on the customer landscape. As you've seen, 2013 has been a year of gradual and uneven economic recovery across the globe. Against this backdrop, the semiconductor market, while forecasted to show modest growth in 2013, remains highly competitive. To prosper, our customers must excel in both cost and time-to-market while accelerating their adoption of disruptive new technology such as FinFET transistors, 20 and 16, 14 process geometries and multi-pattern masks. While we have not seen a material change in customer behavior, we realize that 2013 is another year in an extended period of uncertainty, and customers have remained somewhat cautious. Nonetheless, they are willing to spend on technology that enables them to differentiate. This is great for Synopsys, as many key customers are specifically counting on us to accelerate their differentiation and speed their time-to-market.", "Driving growth of the market are the 3 segments of mobile, cloud infrastructure and what can be summarized as \"Smart Everything,\" also known as the Internet of Things. The mobile market shows very good growth, which is projected to continue well into the future, albeit with a shifting mix towards more lower-cost devices. The customers in this markets are particularly counting on Synopsys, as they require both advanced FinFET technology and substantial amounts of IP.", "The increasing number of mobile devices, combined with massive Internet search, social applications and video, in turn drives continued demand for cloud infrastructure capacity. This bodes well for Synopsys, as servers and Internet infrastructure use the most challenging silicon technology and EDA optimizations for speed and low power.", "The third category of smart everything is readily visible in the automotive segment, for example. Today's cars include hundreds of sensors, dozens of electronic control units, extensive network systems and millions of lines of software code, which can already exceed 20% of a car's total cost. The electronic and software content will continue to grow as increasingly smart and powerful driving assistance features are added. Integrating these complex hardware/software systems is a real challenge, necessitating the adoption of the types of hardware/software prototyping tools that Synopsys pioneered over the last decade.", "The outlook is especially promising for top-tier customers, who are demanding the most advanced tools, design flows, global support and sophisticated IP. For many of them, we're already their preferred collaboration partner, and their multiyear commitment to Synopsys, reflected in our backlog, has allowed us to invest substantially in new technology that we'll be introducing over the next 18 months.", "Let me provide some technical highlights, starting with implementation. The move to advanced silicon nodes continues unabated as customers seek to take advantage of considerable power, performance and area benefits. During Q4, we saw the number of designs for 22-nanometer and 14-, 16-nanometer increased notably. This has a positive impact on us, as Synopsys is the acknowledged leader at these geometries. Approximately 90% of 20-nanometer-and-below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation tools. We're already engaged all the way down to 10-nanometer in design and at 7-nanometer with TCAD. The design activity on 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes is accelerating. Foundries are under pressure to stabilize their process and provision the necessary IP. Design houses are under pressure to execute their first designs, and we expect that during 2014 and early '15, pressure will mount to ramp yield. These are all areas where Synopsys plays a central role. Competitively, Synopsys has at least a year ahead start. Our complete solution, from earliest stages with TCAD to digital and analog mixed-signal design and verification to IP and global support, is unmatched. Our FinFET solutions are also production proven, with well over 100 million FinFET chips in the market today that were designed with Synopsys tools.", "During the past year, we announced a number of customer and ecosystem partner successes. TSMC certified both our digital and custom design and verification solutions for its 16-nanometer FinFET process and awarded us partner of the year for joint development of their 16-nanometer FinFET design infrastructure.", "We were also presented TSMC's partner of the year award for interface IP for the fourth consecutive year. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of the successful collaboration history and our complete solution. We enabled the tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer low-power test chip and delivered a comprehensive design implementation flow for its leading-edge 14-nanometer FinFET process.", "We announced UMC's first qualification tape-out in its 14-nanometer FinFET process, achieved using Synopsys tools. Our early collaboration with GLOBALFOUNDRIES helped accelerate availability of their 14nm-XM process for the mobile market.", "Achronix standardized on IC Compiler and IC Validator and taped out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based complex FPGA using our tools.", "In addition, in 2014, we plan to roll out next-generation capabilities that will enable notably faster design than anything seen so far. This is the result of many years of R&D, and the initial collaborations show outstanding results that will materially impact the competitiveness of our customers.", "Moving to verification. These increasingly complex chips require an immense amount of complex simulation, emulation, prototyping, verification IP and debug tools. Leading customers rely on us in this area as well, with approximately 70% of advanced digital designs utilizing Synopsys and 19 of the top 20 semiconductors counting on our analog circuit simulation.", "In 2013, we embarked on the development and assembly of a major new verification platform. First, we completed our solution through the acquisitions on EVE, with the industry's fastest emulator, and SpringSoft, with the gold-standard debug tool. Since then, we have mounted a massive effort to develop a next-generation verification platform. The customers response has been excellent, and hereto, we have a strong pipeline of capabilities that will be rolled out over the next 18 months.", "Finally, our IP and Systems products continue to grow very nicely, now representing approximately 25% of revenue. Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world and #1 in interface, analog and memory segments. Outsourcing of standard-based IP continues to increase. We estimate that just over about 50% is outsourced today. With a potential TAM of $4 billion to $5 billion, there's plenty of runway for continued Synopsys growth in IP.", "Our track record of quality and efficiency, plus the increased complexity of the IP we are delivering, means that our customers not only save money buying for Synopsys, but also accelerate their schedules and de-risk their chips. During the past year, we continued to deliver highly sophisticated products, including memory IP and logic libraries for a number of 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes. Looking into 2014, we expect FinFET-based IP to grow as design in these technology accelerates. Simultaneously, we have embarked on next-generation interface protocols such as DDR4, PCI Express Gen 4, USB 3.1 and HDMI 2.0, all significantly more complex and, thus, promising for our continued growth.", "Given the sophistication of our IP teams, we are very involved in the development of new standards to best meet initial customer demands. For example, after working for 2 years as part of the HDMI Forum to architect the 2.0 specification, we launched our digital and analog cores just 1 day after the Forum ratified the specification. We have subsequently closed HDMI 2.0 deals with a number of customers in applications such as ultra high def 4k TV, video cameras and tablets.", "In summary, amid a customer environment characterized by a mix of economic uncertainty and aggressive investment in design, Synopsys is in a very good position with product and customer momentum, as well as a financial base that supports continued execution and investment. We performed well in 2013 and look at 2014 as a year to expand our technology and market leadership. Our primary economic objective is to drive high single-digit non-GAAP earnings per share expansion.", "We plan to achieve our goal through a combination of the following: one, drive traditional EDA organic revenue growth generally in the low to mid-single-digit range; two, achieve IP and Systems organic revenue growth generally in the low double digits; three, continue to grow non-GAAP operating margins solidly into the mid-20s through continued global focus in operational efficiency; four, actively explore value- and TAM-expanding M&A; and five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow through a balance of M&A, debt reduction and/or stock buybacks.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year and provide you with our guidance for Q1 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Now, as a reminder, FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and total expenses by $25 million and $16 million, respectively.", "Synopsys delivered a solid fourth quarter, wrapping up an outstanding year. FY '13 financial results were highlighted by double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we significantly exceeded our original 2013 target for operating cash flow and continued our stock repurchase program. Q4 total revenue increased 11% to $505 million. Annual revenue grew 12% to $1.962 billion, the third consecutive year we've delivered double-digit growth. This, of course, includes the revenue contribution from our fiscal 2012 acquisitions. But even excluding these transactions, business was very solid.", "We met our original 2013 revenue growth targets, even in the context of the significant yen depreciation this year, due to our stronger business models. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for approximately 11% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 3 years. For all of fiscal 2013, it was greater than 3.5 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal in Q2. We currently expect average duration for FY '14 to be approximately 3 years.", "Three-year backlog increased to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion, with just over $1.5 billion scheduled to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2014. Taking into account the impact of our larger hardware sales and the continued strength in IP, we have approximately 75% of our target fiscal 2014 revenue in hand for the coming year.", "Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $454 million, which included $30.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $18 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.716 billion, which included $127.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $67.5 million of stock-based compensation.", "Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $396 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.491 billion, an expected increase due to headcount and expenses from our 2012 acquisitions, primarily SpringSoft and EVE, along with year-over-year increases such as employee compensation and planned hiring.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.7% for the quarter and 24% for the full year, the second consecutive year of margin expansion. For all of FY '14, we expect an increase in non-GAAP operating margin similar to that of FY '13. Our ongoing goal continues to be the focus of operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 for the quarter and $1.58 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.56, while full year non-GAAP earnings grew 16% to $2.44. This is the third consecutive year in which we've substantially exceeded our high single-digit EPS growth objective. Non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21% for both Q4 and the full year. Now, as a reminder, the full year 2013 reflects the reinstated R&D tax credit for both FY '12 and '13, which benefited FY '13 earnings by approximately $0.12. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% is a reasonable estimate for all of fiscal 2014.", "Now turning to our cash flow. We generated $191 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $497 million for all of fiscal 2013. FY '13 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations, due primarily to higher-than-planned business levels and cash collections experienced throughout the year. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan in Q4 and $30 million for the full year, leaving a remaining balance of $105 million. During the quarter, we purchased about 2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $75 million. For all of fiscal 2013, we spent $145 million repurchasing about 4 million shares. Yesterday, the board replenished its share repurchase authorization to $500 million.", "We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 46% onshore and 54% offshore. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of $425 million to $450 million in FY '14. We plan to continue optimizing the use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.", "Finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments.", "Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter and $65 million for the year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital spending of approximately $130 million. The increase was primarily facilities related, including a 2-year project to build out a newly leased Bay Area facility that will replace several current buildings and several projects related to past acquisitions.", "DSO was 46 days, reflecting the timing of invoices, and we ended Q4 with approximately 8,570 employees with about 1/3 in lower-cost geographies.", "So now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. For the first quarter of FY '14, our targets are revenue between $475 million and $485 million. As we communicated last year, we expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue going forward. This can be driven by factors such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue; timing of IP consulting projects and royalties; and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are received.", "However, we continue to expect a revenue model that's approximately 90% time based. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $422 million and $444 million, which includes approximately $18 million of stock-based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $377 million and $387 million. Other income and expense between $6 million and $8 million, which includes a gain associated with a previous investment. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million. GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.38 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.53 per share.", "So now, looking at fiscal 2014, our outlook is for revenue between $2.06 billion and $2.085 billion, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. We note an approximate 1 percentage point headwind -- it's not material, but it results from the devalued yen rates that we locked in during 2013; other income and expense between $7 million and $10 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.82, including impact of approximately $78 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 7%. And as I mentioned, FY '13 earnings reflect the approximate $0.12 benefit from the reinstated R&D tax credit, and we are targeting cash flow from operations of $425 million to $450 million.", "Now finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2014 revenue and expense profile. At this time, we expect second half revenue to be a bit higher than our first half revenue, with Q4 higher than both Q2 and Q3, which are similar. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly towards the second half of the year.", "In summary, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, highlighted by double-digit top and bottom line growth, solid operating margins and strong cash flow generation.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So, as you noted in your prepared remarks, for the full year outlook, you've got 75% coming from backlog versus the 80% we've seen for the last couple of years. How much of that revenue that won't be coming from backlog would you attribute to the emulation type of products versus IP versus other things that maybe is more transactional or upfront revenue recognition?", "Brian M. Beattie", "Well, the shift of where we've seen, last year, for example, 80% moving to 75% does reflect the increased amount of revenue associated with hardware businesses and with our IP balance of increasing revenues there, which are a little bit more front-end loaded. And it's just the profile of the business that comes through based on the makeup of that. Our hardware business continues to grow. We can see, again, continued growth in our IP and Systems business. So that really takes into account the shift from the 80% to the 75%.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And when you look -- Aart, when you look at the -- you mentioned kind of the leading-edge designs, et cetera. How would you characterize kind of the budget and the headcount views in terms of the design teams, design engineers at your customers, heading into 2014?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, actually, I think it follows very much the semiconductor evolution, which is a slight growth. I think a lot of the companies that are venturing into the very advanced designs do it pretty much with the same teams. There are a number of situations where companies acquire additional teams, mostly for the specialties that they bring in-house, as they go towards more complete solutions. I can't say that I even have heard anywhere that suddenly, the teams are dramatically different. I think they just follow sort of the industry. And that makes sense because everything we see in terms of the complexity growing rapidly, our tools can -- I wouldn't say easily, but they can certainly match the increasing complexity. And good old Moore\u2019s Law is very much alive and well, and our industry follows up with it.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And last question. As you look at 2014, you kind of characterized the growth rates, I thought, more industry-like, core EDA versus IP. Would you think that, looking at your business, that core EDA growth in fiscal '14 was going to be faster, slower, or the same as what you saw in 2013? And the same on -- same question for your IP business.", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think it's, all-in-all, pretty much the same. Now the only reason we are a little bit prudent is because we realize that the semiconductor industry that has had essentially 5 years of fairly slow growth is under some degree of pressure. But on the positive side, there's no question that it also accelerates the adoption of some of the newer technology because they're really looking hard for differentiation. And by the way, we do see continued strong growth on the IP side because -- and maybe that ties a little bit to your earlier question. One way to, out of the same teams, get actually more productivity is to increase the amount of IP we use. And so we definitely see an evolution of design methodology towards what they have predicted for a number of years, and that serves us well.", "Operator", "And the next question is from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Brian, I was hoping you could give us maybe a little more qualitatively on the yen impact for both 2013 and your outlook for '14.", "Brian M. Beattie", "Sure. The yen impact did affect us in '13, on various lines of the P&L, both revenue and, to some extent, the earnings piece because we do have spending also in Japan. And that went in a favorable direction. So, overall, you looked at about a 20% reduction in the impact of the yen last year, going from '12 to '13. But it's just something we had to manage. It did not have a material impact on either revenues or expenses or the bottom line, as a result of the hedging program that we have in effect. Then, if I look at 2014, I said we have a 1 percentage point impact on the top line. That is something, again, we've locked in those hedges, as we kind of directed to everybody during FY '13 that we are locking in those rates in '13 for '14. And it's about a 1% impact to the growth rate, and it's just one of those things we've had to offset with other operating efficiencies and growth in other parts and other regions.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And have you also seen weakness with some of the Japanese customers, or is it really just a yen issue for you in '13 or '14?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I think the economic impact that you just heard about is just a yen currency issue because, from a customer point of view, Synopsys -- and not just last year, I think in the last -- in quite a number of years, has done particularly well, while it's well understood that the overall Japanese industry is going through almost sort of a generational shift in how they do business, who is doing business, how the companies are made up. And so we've actually done quite well in Japan, and I think we have a very strong team there working with all the top companies. So I would say the only impact, really, that we felt has been through the currency change.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Aart, in the past, you've talked a little bit about progress made in the IP from a margins side. Maybe give us an update there and where you are and where you think you can get to.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, in general, on all the IP that we have had on the market or that is a part of our business, we keep improving our efficiency. At the same time, and economically, of course, that's relevant, is we also keep investing in it because we see more opportunity. So, in general, we feel very, very comfortable where the margins of the business are now. They are lower than for the rest of the company. But as you have seen, we continue to improve the overall ops margin of Synopsys, and that certainly includes paying a high degree of attention to the ops margin of a growing business such as the IP.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. Is it as simple as just getting more customers to use the IP, or is it you're fine-tuning how you customize the IP per customer, or is it a little of everything?", "Aart J. de Geus", "I wish I could say it is as simple as. Nothing in what we do is simple, partially for a good reason, actually positive reason, which is the very IP that we do, I think, every 2 years is dramatically increasing in complexity. And while that does add a lot of stress, including economic stress of how to develop it, how to make sure that the quality is there, it does add not only differentiation, it really impacts the efficiency of our customers that are okay with adopting very complex IP from the outside. And so, in that context, I think it's a business that is not only a growth business, it's a very foundational business in terms of where the design methodology is going. And I think, even if it gets harder, it is really good for Synopsys because there's a high value we provide, and therefore, we will see good return.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "And then earlier, you talked about how you've even seen some very early work on 7 nanometers. I'm just kind of curious, how much of your businesses is driven by 10 and 7 at this point?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, it is only through our very most advanced tools. Those fall into the general area of manufacturing. And really, they're 2 areas. One is TCAD. And for those of you not familiar with it, TCAD is really 3-dimensional modeling of devices, almost at the molecular or atomic level. And the other area is, of course, in the mask-making, where doing masks for these geometries requires just fabulous photolithography tricks, if I can put it like that. And so that's the area that we are investing in. And the manufacturing is, I don't know, 10%, 15% of our company or so. So that gives you a sense. It's a subcategory of that, but a very important one and one that gives us very important insight where things are going and also gives the first models of transistors, even before transistors are manufactured.", "Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And lastly, there's a lot of concern today about the ability to yield the 14-nanometer FinFET move as we ramp over the next year or two. Do you feel as though your tools are complete and ready to go as far as that transition goes?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes, I do because, at the end of the day, we do impact yield. But the reality is the sleepless nights on the part of the guys in the fab. They have to continually tune the manufacturing to literally wring out percentage point after percentage point. Recently, the indications are getting more positive about those nodes, so I think that the foundries are really making excellent progress on it. But this is not any different than 1980s, '90s and 2000s. Tomorrow was always really hard. On the design side, though, which is where we sit, I can absolutely say that the tools for FinFET design are not only ready to go, they have been used on quite a number of designs that have either taped out or have gone to production already. And so, while nothing is simple there, I think we are in a very strong technology situation, maybe much stronger even than where we, as a field, were in the late '90s or 2000s.", "Operator", "And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I also had one industry-level question. You guys highlighted how you're getting very good traction on the FinFET side of the business. It's going to be a big opportunity for EDA down the road, and Synopsys, specifically. Given that it's a consolidated industry with only 3 large players, I'm kind of curious to know that -- are you seeing any pricing upside? Is there any way you can actually get value pricing because you're providing such a value-added service? Should we start hoping that, down the road, pricing should start improving due to a consolidated industry and the fact that you guys are enabling such leading technology transitions like FinFET?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, in general, the best way to maintain pricing is, obviously, to not only be providing superior value but to actually be differentiated in it. And I do think that we have a number of areas that Synopsys, specifically, is differentiated. At the same time, we are in a hypercompetitive market. And this is especially competitive because our customers are seeing their world change at a rapid pace, and they have not seen their market grow all that rapidly. So, having said that, I think we're in as good a position as any of the companies. And we've always believed that, if one can conquer the next round of really tough technical problems, that's the first premise to do well. And as a matter of fact, we've seen, again, this year, our run rate go up. I don't think that we've seen any price erosion beyond the normal customers always wanting more for the same renewals. But aside of that, I think we're actually in a quite good position.", "Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it, got it. And then another -- a quick follow-up. Even in your fiscal '14 guidance for Synopsys, or broadly speaking for industry, what do you think is the emulation growth going to be? And what contribution is EVE going to be out of your fiscal '14 guidance?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, we don't break out the contribution of any of our individual products. And we look very much at the emulation part as a key ingredient in our broader verification strategy. It's hard for me to speak for the industry, given that there have been other people in emulation that have substantial size, and they have clearly shown that they can go up and down quite rapidly. Our approach has been, I think, more temperate and more steady because we're looking at a more integrated, broader solution. And that is how we differentiate ourselves, and that has turned out to be, I think, a wise direction.", "Operator", "And the next question's from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.", "Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "This is Zack Ajzenman for Jay. First question. When you're further communicating or substantiating the value and impact of EDA, as with customers, are there certain metrics that you use, for instance, in terms of the results for specific product segments?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Yes. There are some metrics that just come back over and over again. And there are 2 or 3 key categories. Some have been more emphasized in the past than today. But in the past, number one was always the performance of the chips. Number two, invariably, was the power consumption. And because the 2 trade off, you never look at them in isolation. Underneath of that is always how dense a chip can you make, meaning what is the area going to be because that impacts directly the cost of the chips. And that gets refined by, oh, well, if you make them small, can you also make them yield well because that multiplies all of this. And so, pretty quickly, you're into a fairly broad set of metrics. On top of that, touching the time-to-market metrics are really 2, which is the run-time of the tools, and that includes how long does it take to read in the design and set it up, and the amount of memory needed on computers because we somehow lightly say, \"Oh, well, I'm doing a chip with 1 billion transistors.\" That takes substantial compute power. And so time-to-market is very much impacted by how efficient the tools are and how cost-effective they are. And last but not least, as we move more and more towards the hardware/software world, a variety of prototyping forms become important. Now hopefully, this is not too long an answer, but what I told you here is, in one way, nothing new. It has always been objectives that one keeps optimizing. On the other hand, what is new is that the interaction between all of the terms I just gave you is much more prevalent. And therein lies, I think, one of the differentiations for Synopsys, which is we are optimizing so many variables at the same time, and I think we do it quite well. So, in that context, over and over again, we take existing designs, pass them through the new tools and, at the same time, make sure that the new tools are ready for the new technologies. And I think we have quite a machine capable of doing that today.", "Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Has Synopsys been able to quantify what the incremental revenue opportunity from FinFET might be when we take into account specific tool areas that are most likely to be affected, the number of customers likely to design with the new structure and then your share of the affected segment?", "Aart J. de Geus", "It's very difficult to quantify it, partially because, in all the key customers -- and the key customers, invariably, are the most advanced ones that are also the first adopting FinFET technology -- we have multiyear agreements that make sure that at no point in time are they left hanging. With other words, we work with them to migrate the tools to the newest technologies. Now the benefit of that for them, of course, is a high degree of stability in the economic relationship and, most importantly, the technology; but for us, is that at renewal, we have an opportunity to grow our business to be very stable where others are maybe in question in ups and downs of the market and in general, be always connected to where the state-of-the-art is going. And the state-of-the-art is where most of the money is spent. So I think we're in a good position there.", "Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and last question. When you look back on 2013, other than acquired products, which products or segment did you see the most increase in usage and/or the base of user licenses?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Good question. I would say, solely generically, IP is growing just because that market is growing and the number of pieces are growing. On the individual tools, invariably, the highest growth in numbers of copy tend to be in verification, validation. And the reason for that is that the systemic complexity as you have more and more and more transistors grows much more rapidly than the number of transistors. And so those are sort of the tools that, invariably, customers just want more and more copies, and it's almost like they're limited by their own compute farm availability. Now in terms of some of the other tools, the IC Compiler and IC Validator have tended to do very well because the advanced chips really do require a high degree of optimization and verification physically. And Synopsys, I think, is particularly well placed.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And you have a question from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Aart, just see if you can give us a comparison of how you felt entering last year and how do you compare that to this year. Last year, your performance was much better than initial expectations. And also, the semiconductor industry, most of the growth -- I mean, the spend -- I said last -- this year has come from memory, not from everything else. So, in that environment, the EDA has grown reasonably well. How do you -- I know that there is a caution for the next year, but even in a very cautious semi environment, do you think you can perform in the same manner you did in 2013?", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, obviously, every year is a little bit different, although we enter, typically, with the same level of confidence, and then it's full speed ahead on evolving through the year. What was different last year, we had made a large set of acquisitions, and so there was a high degree of emphasis on the integration, making sure that the transition for the customers would work well. This year, we're entering '14 with having made a large number of investments in R&D over the last, actually, more than 18 months, and integration of technologies acquired. And so it's going to be a fair degree of focus on advancing the introduction of new capabilities that will be announced throughout the year and, I think, will make a major impact on the customers. Just to clarify a little bit more about how I look at the semiconductor market, I cannot really say that our customers have changed or are dramatically more or less cautious. I'm just observing the number of years of, let's say, mitigated growth in semiconductors with an increase in complexity. What that brings about is a fairly high dynamic among the customers on how are they competing. In general, that is called uncertainty. In practice, it's called opportunity for us because if we can help them, in that situation, do better, we add real value. And by the way, it's interesting, you mentioning memories, because we've actually done quite well in that domain. And you're absolutely correct, the price -- that segment grew, but it grew mostly because prices went up. And as you remember, it went all the way as bad as one of the fabs burning down and, immediately, the market growing more. So those dynamics are beyond our control. But what we do have impact on is that they, too, are driving technology towards the systemic complexity end, meaning not just make the transistors smaller, but make, actually, the memories much more complex. And that is very interesting to us because, again, many of our system tools, even some of our IP and, certainly, our digital tools are highly applicable to that evolution. So, in general, we're looking at a very dynamic market that, hopefully, will attract more money. But for right now, we're in a good position.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That was very helpful. And Brian, just a question on your revenue profile. Just can you give us some color around what drives the linearity of revenue so that we can model it better going forward and...", "Brian M. Beattie", "You best, Mahesh. On the quarterly profile, it reflects, again, a very detailed bottom-up, account-by-account profile. Given that we've got $3.1 billion of backlog, as you know, we profile that out by quarter, by account. And the guidance that we provided this afternoon gives you the perspective of how much would be in Q1 and then what that revenue profile would be. We said it'll be slightly higher in the second half of the year. Also, we could note that Q1 is followed by other quarters of growth as well. So that's how it is. So it really kind of breaks out to the individual makeup of the detailed backlog of those accounts. It ties into when cash is scheduled to be collected. It takes into account the makeup of hardware, things like royalties, which, again, are not in the backlog. They come in based on usage in the future. So, again, we take all that into account providing to you that level of guidance for the quarters and the halves of the year to address the linearity question you had.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one more last question on your 24% tax guide. Does that include investment tax credit?", "Brian M. Beattie", "It does not. It takes into account, because it's a calendar year R&D tax credit, it goes until December 31 of the year. But we have assumed no additional R&D tax credits to be in effect from January 1 forward for all of '14.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But you do expect that to be there for 2014? What's your opinion on that?", "Brian M. Beattie", "No, we don't. No, we do not have that taken into account based on -- we call it -- in a tax world, we call it extenders. And right now, in a world of tax reform and all the other positioning, the expectations that all companies have right now is don't count on that for 2014. So that's what's reflected in our statement. And if it got approved at some point in the future, then we would be able to reflect that in the numbers.", "Operator", "And speakers, at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Back to you for closing remarks.", "Aart J. de Geus", "Well, thank you very much for your time. I think we closed a very strong 2013 with many investments that will become visible in '14. And our job is to make that a great year again. We look forward to talk to you after the call or in subsequent events. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you.

(Operator Instructions).Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Rich. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgement about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", " ", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today\u2019s earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today.

", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our fiscal second-quarter results were very strong and solidify our expectations for the full-year. In summary, business was robust in all key areas. After many years of investment and innovation we launched several important new products including a game changer in digital design. And we closed the acquisition of Coverity bringing us into the emerging market of software quality, test and security.", "Highlighting our financial results; we delivered revenue of $518 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 and a $112 million in operating cash flow. For the year, we\u2019re now including the impacts of the Coverity in our guidance. Based on the combination of solid organic business and the impact of purchase accounting on Coverity, we expect 2014 revenue of $2.050 billion to $2.075 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50. We are also raising our operating cash flow guidance to a range of $450 million to $475 million primarily reflecting strong collections in the organic business. ", "If you look at the customer landscape, we see continued focus on balancing the drive for better faster differentiated products with a continued caution around cost. If there is any change in our customer\u2019s mindset, it is the mounting pressure to develop and utilize a more and more advanced technology. In addition, companies are relying more on complex software to differentiate their products. And their customers are becoming less and less tolerant of software with quality and security effect. ", "Synopsys is uniquely positioned to be the partner of choice for companies facing these challenges. With our technical expertise, standing all the way from deep silicon to the hardware software intersection to software, we now deal to nearly all companies that utilize technology to drive their business. Our edit emphasis on software not only extends our business opportunity along the path, that our existing customers are taking, but also engages a broad set of new companies across the industry spectrum. ", "Synopsys is one of the deepest high-tech companies in the world and we deliver some of the most sophisticated software ever built. With Coverity, we\u2019ve entered a market segment that now needs and will benefit from the same level of technical depth. This changes our outlook considerably as it is opening our broadest customer base ever.", "Let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with leadership in core EDA, which was marked by some product introductions that can be rated among the most important in the decade. The first of those, IC COMPILER II is the game changing successor to IC COMPILER, today\u2019s industry-leading place-and-route solution. Several years ago, we\u2019ve tasked our team to drive an order of magnitude leap in productivity by developing a complete new architecture and algorithm while in parallel continuing advances in our existing IC COMPILER flagship product. ", "The team has succeeded well beyond my expectations. IC COMPILER II is truly transformative and features like measurable 10X faster throughputs. 10X now 10% is in an astounding accomplishment, introduced at our March users group meeting, key partners such as Imagination, LSI, Panasonic, NSD told attendees about their early use and independently confirmed the magnitude of the results.", "While IC Compiler II will officially shipped as a full system in July as it\u2019s already contributed to production designs at early partners and we have received confirmation of several successful tape-outs. Needless to say, there is significant interest and demand which we are managing carefully to ensure seamless adoption and success for early customers. The timing of this breakthrough coincides perfectly with our technology push into advance FinFET supporting all of the capabilities needed for absolute state of the art design of very complex devices. Incidentally the breakthrough algorithmic advances also benefit hard driving designs at well established notes such as 28, 40 and 65 nanometer; for example where 10X throughput improvements are economically just as meaningful. We\u2019re also making excellent progress in our custom digital co-design and one to engagements over the incumbent for our custom FinFET solutions.", "Moving to verification, we announced a major step in our roadmap towards redefining this market segment and giving customers a next generation end-to-end solution that does not exists today. Specifically in March, we introduced Verification Compiler which features complete access to old verification technology needed in a single product including industry leading stimulation and debug. In addition, verification complier includes brand new static and formal technologies that are 3 to 5x faster than anything on the market. On top of that, key verification ID significantly completes and accelerates the verification of crucial ID structures. All of this is tightly integrated to deliver 3x productivity improvement for customers\u2019 increasingly compact circuits.", "The result of the massive development and integration project set by both organically developed and acquired technology, verification complier is a great first step on a multiyear roadmap to revolutionize verification. On the hardware side, we introduced our next generation emulator ZeBu Server-3 it\u2019s the industry\u2019s fastest system with the highest capacity available today. Customers such as AMD and Freescale have already adopted our new solution, citing benefits and shortening verification time and meeting accelerated software development and validation schedules.", "Although application vision and the innovations recently introduced are triggering partnerships with key customers and one world leader already made a major commitment for long term collaboration with us this quarter. Now to IP, where demand is strong evidenced by record orders in the quarter as the leader interface memory analog and physical IT and the number of two IT play overall Synopsys continues to benefit from our customers move to outsourcing more and more complex IT driving our success our unmatched product quality breadth that enables design teams to centralize a substantial portion of their purchases with us and almost 2,000 engineers on the leading edge of technology development.", "Even the few customers who have resolutely help onto internal development are we examining their strategy and are increasingly selected Synopsys of their partner. One of the few major semiconductor companies who have not previously purchased our IP for the number of interface blocks this quarter as a first step towards a broader outsourcing effort. In Q2, we announced two major new IP titles a new USB 2.0 and 3.05 that reduces area by 50% over the previous generation and the industry\u2019s first LPDDR4 memory controller. A couple of years ago we began offering the next level of IP, complete subsystems. They include elements such as interface blocks low power processors memories and software all optimized for a particular application.", "One example is our sensor subsystem which is gaining good traction in the Internet of Thing space. Our FPGA base and virtual prototyping products also continue to do very well. We just announced a multiyear center of excellence collaboration with Freescale to speed development of automotive electronic systems software. And driving the future in prototyping, we collaborated with industry leaders to publish a seminal book on advanced software development with virtual prototypes. The titles says it better software faster. Using real-life case studies allow mobile, consumer, industrial and automotive partners, the book offers practical guidelines for accelerating project schedules. ", "We\u2019ve already had little over 1,000 downloads in just a few weeks. Better software faster is precisely the mission of our new business group. After just two months the acquisition of Coverity is showing great promise. As a refresher, Coverity products are central in the software creation lifecycle. Our tools are dramatically test source code for software defects that can lead to product crashes, unexpected behavior, security breaches or catastrophic system failures. In contrast to traditionally running the code and waiting for bugs to appear our tools find details by sophisticated formal inspection of the code itself. About half of Coverity\u2019s business is with our current customers although addressing different users and different budget. The rest extends well beyond catering to independent software vendors, ecommerce and industries as wide ranging as energy, industrial and financial services. The strategic Coverity acquisition does significantly expands our talent and customer base. Within the broad automated software quality space, which analysts size at approximately 2.5 billion, Coverity is the leader in the sub-segment called software quality analysis and measurement? IDC sizes this segment at approximately 500 million with estimated 2017 market revenue of nearly 1 billion. Our goal is to build a substantial presence in this space over the years similar to what we did first with EDA than IP. To that end last week, we announced the small acquisition Kalistick that expands our reach beyond software developers to quality assurance while bringing a number of cloud capabilities to Coverity.", "Results to-date have been very encouraging. Orders were slightly better than expected in Coverity\u2019s first six weeks at Synopsys. The team is running on all cylinders, already driving increased lead generation and closing a number of growth renewal opportunities. Our objective is to determine the right level of integration by the end of the Synopsys fiscal year to maximize our brand and channel leverage while optimizing for the specific needs of this exciting market. Due to the purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue, we expect Coverity to contribute $20 million to $25 million in revenue and the approximately $0.10 to $0.13 dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this year. Without the purchase accounting impact, Coverity would already be accretive this year. We reiterate that we expect it to reach breakeven in the second half of 2015 and be accretive in 2016 and beyond.", "In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter with some extraordinarily high impacting product introductions in the core of our business, strong business and demand for sophisticated IP and a great entry into the software quality test and security market with excellent execution of the on-boarding of Coverity. Well, having made big strive in further differentiating our core business, we are also well on our way to diversifying the company into new areas and feel that we are executing well on the growth strategy we have communicated to you a number of years ago. Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie ", "", "Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Now Synopsys delivered a very strong quarter highlighted by strong business levels and considerable cash flow generation. Additionally, we continued our stock repurchase program and completed the Coverity acquisition and two smaller tuck-in deals. Total revenue was $518 million, above our target range. As expected revenue from the Coverity product sales were very modest, reflecting the standard purchase accounting haircut that was applied to deferred revenue during the first six weeks as part of Synopsys and I will say more about this later.", "About 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and we have one 10% customer. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.8 years. We continue to expect weighted average duration for FY14 to be approximately three years. Turning to expenses now, Q2 total GAAP cost and expenses were $454 million which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $19 million of stock-based compensation. Q2 total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $393 million, slightly above our Q2 guidance due to the Coverity acquisition. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24% for the quarter and 23.4% for the first half of fiscal 2014.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.40, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.65 exceeding our target range even with the $0.02 dilution from Coverity. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for the quarter below our target due primarily to a more favorable geographic mix than forecasted. As a result, we think that the non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21% is a reasonable estimate for FY14. ", "Now turning to our cash flow, during the quarter, we generated 112 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $450 million to $475 million. We ended the quarter with total debt of $290 million which includes $200 million from our revolver due to the Coverity acquisition. We also repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan leaving a remaining balance of $90 million.", "During the quarter we purchased 628,000 shares of Synopsys stock for $25 million. During the first half of the fiscal year, we spent $80 million, repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares and have $420 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 822 million with 18% onshore and 82% offshore. DSO was 57 days reflecting strong business levels and the timing of invoices. We ended Q2 with approximately 9,100 employees with over one-third in lower cost geographies and approximately 325 of the additional employees were from our Q2 acquisitions.", "Now a couple of additional words about Coverity product sales. For reporting purposes you\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve adjusted our financial supplement to reflect the inclusion of Coverity products in an updated product group we call IP and software solutions. While we\u2019re not breaking up Coverity product sales, we are on track with expected $20 million to $25 million of revenue in FY14 as we work through the deferred revenue haircut.", "Without the impact of deferred revenue haircut FY14 contribution from Coverity would have been approximately $24 million higher and would have been accretive on a non-GAAP basis in 2014. At closing Coverity had $69 million of deferred revenue of which 69% or $47 million will not be recognized due to standard purchase accounting. The majority of the haircut occurs in the first two years with a small amount extending beyond that. So as a result we continue to expect that Coverity will reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of 2015.", "At a corporate level, we continue to manage the company with a multi-year goal of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth, contributing that is core EDA revenue growth generally in the low to mid single-digits, IP and software solutions revenue growth generally in the low double-digits, operating margin in the mid 20s, exploration of value and expanding M&A and optimizing use of our strong cash flow through a balance of M&A stock buybacks and debt reduction.", "So now let\u2019s address have third quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter of FY14 our targets are revenue between $515 million and $525 million. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $450.5 million and $471 million, which includes approximately $20 million of stock based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $400 million and $410 million. Other income and expense between $1 million and negative million, on a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%, outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million. GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.38 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.", "Now our fiscal 2014 outlook. Revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.075 billion. Other income expense between $10 million and $12 million, non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21%, outstanding shares between $155 million and $159 million. GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.68 which includes the impact of approximately $79 million in stock based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50 reflecting the expected $0.10 to $0.13 dilution from Coverity partially offset by our Q2 over achievements.", "Return to capital expenditures to approximately $115 million and we\u2019re now targeting cash flow from operation of $450 million to 475 million. So in summary we\u2019re pleased with our very good second quarter financial performance and continued execution. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll begin with the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera - Needham & Company", "", "I had a question on ICC II, was hoping to get some sense of the potential financial impact from this. I was wondering first you could say if it\u2019s a maintenance upgrade or if you\u2019ll get incremental revenue when customers upgrade to it. And then how do you expect it to sort of roll out to your customer base? It sounds like general release in July but how would we expect this to roll out to your entire customer sort of timing and how that might affect bookings and revenue as we look out over the next couple of year?", "Aart de Geus", "First this is not the maintenance upgrade, this is a new product. The only refinement on that statement is that we have a number of customers that can have access to new technology provided that they buy off the price list at that point in time and so they can replace existing products with the new products which will bring new revenue opportunities for us. But also brings fabulous leverage for the customer because it is truly dramatically better.", "So from that perspective it is a product that\u2019s priced higher but also valued much higher than what we have, which is arguably already the best on the market. Having said that the adoption rate I expect to be quite fast, because when you have that level of productivity improvement and of course we have tried to design it so that the changeover issues are very minimal, you can very quickly move to the new product. People that are on the constant pressure to get to better design sooner -- we are immediately intrigued by us, I think that\u2019s why we have already lot of demand. Nonetheless, we will pay high degree of attention to make sure that the early customers do very well and get good results and are very well supported. And we do that with all new products and actually all new releases to make sure that we feather them in but the interest is certainly super high right now. ", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Question on EVE, you have been fairly quiet about EVE since you bought it a bit ago and now you\u2019ve done a lot of work, sort of integrating into verification compiler and you\u2019ve got ZeBu 3 out, so just wondering; one, wouldn\u2019t expect that there has been a lot of growth there, just due to last commentary that could be mistaken, so I would be happy to get your thoughts on that. But two, do you see that product is maybe reinvigorated and having a better sort of medium term growth outlook than it may be had in the past, your thoughts?", "Aart de Geus", "Excellent question; it\u2019s actually one year - the absolute capabilities of the product itself, and -- multiple generations of this product, and two, the degree of integration in our offering. What we just announced this quarter was really the next generation of the product. So a product that is substantially faster again for substantially higher capacity; the integration has many-many ramifications. We actually did not say all that much about it. And we have made excellent progress there, but we have still more work to do. And I would say, stay tuned on what will be coming there because there are a lot of capabilities that will be leveraged by a much better degree of integration.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Well enough, and Brian, question for you on the revenue guidance. At the risk of splitting hairs here, if you look at the midpoint of your old and new revenue guidance for the year, you are up $15 million you guided to $20 million to $25 million from Coverity, so you know that would imply sort of down $5 million to $10 million in the base business. Is that accurate math, and might sort of this rounding, just wanted to get your take on that.", "Brian Beattie", "I would look kind of, Rich, this is just a narrowing of the range, given again we had good momentum for the first six months. We feel very comfortable on our Outlook now with only six months left to go. We see a fact that our run rate is up, and it\u2019s really effectively narrowing of the range, and again the Coverity piece is performing exactly as we expected, even slightly ahead in the first six weeks.", "Richard Valera - Needham & Company", "Brain, just wanted to understand, you gave some nice color on Coverity sort of with and without deferred and that color suggested roughly 50% deferred haircut in the sort of seven-month contribution this year which seems quite high. Is there anything unusual about their business model and how do you view that level of deferred haircut relative sort of a typical acquisition in the type of business?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, we see actually based on all the valuation and work that we did and our third parties did a 69% haircut on the overall deferred revenues that we acquired at the beginning of the company. As you know just the accounting rules are that you do get to keep the cost to generating that revenue going forward plus there is more margin, and in a way the good news is that the cost of ongoing is not that significant. And therefore the haircut at 69% is typically a little bit higher than what we would see. We also saw the deferred revenues being a little bit higher relative to the annual run rates in companies we have acquired in the past have had. Explaining those two factors have combined to slightly higher deferred revenue haircut than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "Operator", "I\u2019ll now go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch; please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for taking my question, actually have a few of them. The IC COMPILER II definitely seems very interesting and exciting for you guys. Just trying to figure out, you guys don\u2019t breakout your current IC COMPILER product which is probably part of your core EDA revenue. But do you think the IC COMPILER II could be $100 million revenue product next year?", "Aart de Geus", "Actually you said, you felt we don\u2019t breakout the individual product, but there is no question that IC COMPILER will, I think fairly rapidly be added on top of IC COMPILER or replace a number of IC COMPILERS that are in utilization today because it has really the ability to do the same amount of work in literally a fraction of the time. And it is interesting by the way to see how different customers use the capability very differently. Some say, well, now I can go to market faster, but there are also quite a number that say, oh now because of that I can actually do more optimization and bring out some more area or some more speed and thus make my product either lower cost, lower silicon cost of higher performance, that\u2019s higher differentiation. It\u2019s always intriguing to see how when one provide something that is truly radically better; the ways that which it gets used is not always predictable. The reason am sharing this is because we have already very good evidence of the very good results from multiple customers and so I expect it to be phased into utilization very rapidly. From an economic point of view this is all part of our usual three year ratable model. And we expects and hope that this will utilize up a little faster the contracts that we have in place with customers and that\u2019s always an opportunity to grow our business.", "Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Got it Aart that\u2019s very helpful and I just had a couple of more questions. The last earnings call you guys kind of like flick verity you guys didn\u2019t done your full year revenue little bit because FinFET customers are seeing some kind of like push outs in the schedule. So I am kind of curious what the status is now do you think they\u2019ve been working to the issues or do you think that it\u2019s still going to be a while before you start seeing those revenues slowing for you?", "Aart de Geus", "No actually we see a lot of business around FinFET and partially because we are not just working with customers also part of putting place to their ecosystem that\u2019s necessary in order to do advanced FinFET design and what I mean with that our the IP that is necessary around that and a number of the stores that are looking at the yields optimization. And so you\u2019re absolutely right that a number of the providers of FinFET technology did a number of adjustments to their schedules but also to the competitiveness of their product. And so the race is absolutely on among the people providing the silicon and what we can see is that there typically two groups there is a group that is already moving massively to FinFET because they have either the super high volume or the technology needs of a very large transits account and low power and then there is a group that is saying well I am going to wait at 28 nanometer, which is exactly behaving as we have predicted already a year ago, and is going to be a big note, and then there are a number of people that even use older technologies but really squeeze them for economic benefit. And so it\u2019s sort of advanced design at every node at this point in time but our tools have had big impact on all of these nodes because productivity enhancements lay everywhere. So from that perspective we see a lot of intense investments and a number of people essentially jockeying for being in the lead position from a technology point of view and this year we\u2019ll see a lot of design.", "Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then the final question is that obviously there is a lot of M&A means the question I asked in the past in terms of capital allocation and you\u2019re doing like I guess like minimum buybacks every quarter. Is this still the plan or is there a plan to get more aggressive on the buybacks or maybe consider dividend down the road?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, we\u2019ve been very clear around for many years as the priority relative to our capital structure has been on new tam creation or value and earnings generation through M&A and we have put the balance sheet to work and particularly is we look at our past quarter with Coverity, we did spend total of about $368 million in our second quarter and also did a small buyback. So again our priorities are in that order of M&A first, buyback second and our debt repayment and that\u2019s how we plan to continue to deploy and just look continue to look at all the options in front of us from quarter to quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Chase & Co", "So in your prepared remarks you kind of talked about the pressure at the customers have in terms of the technology side but still being balanced within cost tranches I guess what I\u2019d like to hear is in summary do you feel that your customers\u2019 buying behavior or buying position is in a healthier position today than where it was with the at the end of last year?", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah, I think if you look at the chart that sort of look at semiconductor growth rates at variety of confidence meters they all look a little bit better than last year. I am maybe cautious just because I have seen so many of these for many years and so when we say they look a little bit better than means that A people are right now forecasting the second half of the year little bit higher growth in semiconductors and B the confidence send the access up by 3% or 4%. Now 3% to 4% when you\u2019re below 50 or above 50 is all the difference between seeing good weather or bad weather and from that perspective I think that people do feel a little bit better but they are just as experienced as I am in terms of many years and so they remain careful because these all big decisions.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Chase & Co", "Sure. Switching over to IC Complier II, how is the pricing of that compared to IC Complier on an apples-to-apples basis?", "Aart de Geus", "Well the IC Complier II is priced higher and there is a variety of prices because there is a variety of configuration of the system including different configuration for different computer situations and we don\u2019t disclose all the details of that. But obviously we do it in such a fashion that the value that the customer get is many times higher than the increase in pricing so that at the end of the day hopefully both the customer and ourselves are happy campers in this equation and that\u2019s they feel very compelled to moved to this new technology because it will have good impact on them. But this is clearly a case where there is no question that there is massively more value this is not an incremental 1.3x or 1.4x better which by the way we deliver at least every year, so we have always been on a fast treadmill. This is really an order of magnitude and that just changes the whole equation of utilization going forward.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "", "What portion of the IC complier installed base is not on a contract where they could trade into it by just buying the or paying the price differentials? So in other words, what portion of the IC complier installed base, if they do decide to move, would end up paying the full price?", "Aart de Geus", "", "I actually don\u2019t know the answer to that, my guess would be not all that many but in general that has never been an impairment for people to move or start spending more money, if there is more value. So, the ability to upgrade from IC complier one is often there in the contracts but the ability to upgrade from other products is really there.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "", "On Coverity, can you remind us what the contract structure is there, where I am typically wondering about how quickly the deferred revenue that you have written-off may come back into the income statement as you go through contract renewal?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, the first comment would be and this was part of the earlier question of, so why is the haircut bigger than what we normally see on company. Well, this was a company that was very aggressively trying to use the revenue as soon as possible in order to be able to invest in high growth. This is a great opportunity space and we will continue to try to do that at the same time we have very disciplined typically three year contract horizon. We are in the process of learning what is actually the optimal contract configuration for Coverity, as they are in the different space, software people do behave differently. And one of the reasons we are cautious before we make a lot of changes to their business is because we want to first learn what they have done to do it so well and if there are improvements or if there are things that we can apply that we have learned in our ability to scale, is we should certainly apply those because this is business that is eminently scalable.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "", "Last question, will you maintain or expand the Coverity sales force because it sounds like it\u2019s a different touch point even within your existing customers to sale that?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well we will certainly retain all the sales people. We have some very, very good people there. How we structure it is precisely part of the decision process between now and the end of our fiscal year because that\u2019s sort of a natural point to decide to what extent we integrate or not and maybe sophisticated path in the middle to take advantage of some of the practices that have been particularly good at and take advantage of some of the brand position and the company position at Synopsys is on a worldwide basis that is much more comprehensive. So, maybe it\u2019s a long answer to say, we don\u2019t know the answer to your question yet because we are in the process of rapidly learning.", "Operator", "", "We will now go to line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yes, good afternoon. I guess first small question for Brian, when you look at the EPS upside in the quarter despite the slight negative impact of Coverity. Was the upside primarily driven by taxes or was there another component that was quite beneficial?", "Brian Beattie ", "", "Well our revenues came in very strong in a quarter towards the higher end of what we have anticipated, so that helped us out as well. The spending, again as we are managing towards that EPS number for this year, even with a little bit of headwind, we have talked about back in Q1, we are still committed to making that earnings per share that we have addressed earlier. So, we have been watching our expenses very closely. And then the third point is as you mentioned, our tax rate and the geographic mix which does take into account the impact of our acquisitions and where they are located has provided a favorable geographical mix of our pretax income. And of course we have to catch up in our second quarter on a year-to-date basis to make that entry as well. So, all that contributed to very attractive tax rate for us and we see that in terms of very attractive tax rate for the entire 2014. So, overall that\u2019s how we contributed. We had a great start to the year to get us on track and you can see that confidence in the full year guidance.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then when you look at your cash level, I think you mentioned that it was 18% onshore. Is there a minimum level of cash you would like to have onshore when considering your potential acquisitions or share repurchasing?", "Brian Beattie ", "", "Yes, there is Tom. We actually used that this past quarter, so we have about a $120 million of tax in the U.S. and that is healthy amount based on any of our commitments that we have elsewhere. So, that\u2019s the kind of a $120 million is a good minimum U.S. onshore tax rate and for the purposes of the acquisition again very specific purpose. We borrowed a very low cost interest rate of about 1.3% and we are able to use that to leverage up the capabilities in the company. And again, our discipline is traditionally to pay that off over some period of time probably by the end of the year and again we will see our U.S. balance growing up a little bit.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", " ", "Okay. Are you seeing\u2026", "Aart de Geus", "I think he meant cash rates right Brian, cash rate not tax rate.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yes.", "Aart de Geus", "", "That 120 million tax rate, you meant cash.", "Brian Beattie ", "", "In the cash.", "Aart de Geus", "", "Sorry.", "Brian Beattie ", "", "Cash dollars yes.", "Aart de Geus", "", "We are team here.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And have you seen a potential for more offshore type acquisitions out there most of which you look at is U.S. based?", "Aart de Geus", "No we look at many things all the time and as you can imagine we don\u2019t communicate much about that ahead of times. But if you take not that long ago we did two major acquisitions off shore, one was SpringSoft the other was EVE and so the reality of worldwide taxation is such that we do distinguish between the different locations of the cash and we have to take that into account when we plan forward.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "But you see plenty of other candidates out there that are on offshore basis?", "Aart de Geus", "One never sees plenty, one look at plenty and look at many bite you.", "Aart de Geus", "Tom we did three deals overall in Q2 and one significant one was U.S. based but the other two were in Europe, so again we continue to see opportunities for investing outside the country as well.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay great. And then when you look at the IP part of the business, have you seen an increase in competition in that space since you guys like Cadence have got little more aggressive?", "Aart de Geus", "Well anytime there is more competition one sees that immediately and we consider that just part of a market that is actually growing very well. And so in that context Synopsys continues to do well and last quarter was a very good example of that. But competition just tries the state of the art forward faster and that is part of why we\u2019re an extraordinary industry.", "Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.", "It sounds like there is some pretty strong growth in the next couple of years as the industry moves towards more of an outsourced model. Beyond that do you see the actual IP market itself growing or is it mainly just the outsourcing portion of it that\u2019s the growth driver?", "Aart de Geus", "Well that\u2019s an excellent question because obviously initially it is outsourcing and we Synopsys have already seen multiple different ways from outsourcing stuff that anybody could design to outsourcing things that are reasonably difficult to design and where it really becomes a build versus buy decision for the customer to now outsourcing blocks that are extremely complex to build. And then on top of that extremely complex to build on the most advanced silicon technology. And so in that sense some of the Synopsys intellectual property is highly differentiated already today.", "So that itself is half of the answer because as people outsource more things, they also now increasingly get access to building blocks that previously would not have been able to build themselves, and I think that changes a bit the very nature of design especially in light that many of these building blocks themselves are sort of almost mini computers and therefore they come with embedded software and the opportunity for the customer to differentiate themselves more and more with the layers of software on top of that.", "That all sounds maybe a little complex but complexity is precisely what feeds certainly Synopsys business. And so the IP I think is a great contributor towards the next decade of very sophisticated chip design.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now go to line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest", "", "The first question is on IC Compiler II with the IC Compiler II you have been -- nicely have been able to drive higher value for Synopsys with this new version of the tool. So do you think as you release the new version of the other tools in the simulation market prototype other segments that you could also drive higher value than previous generation of those tools?", "Aart de Geus", "Well that has been our life long objective of course as a company, in many if you look back for just a second I think it\u2019s fair to say that Synopsys is certainly one of the reasons Moore\u2019s law has prospered so well on the design side we have continued to support it. Going forward we absolutely see at least another decade of continuation of complexity and that involves doing exactly what we just did with all these tools, which is dramatic new improvement in light of sophisticated new technology challenges coming our way.", "And so just to clarify also an answer from earlier, many of our customers when they buy into one of our advanced tools, such as IC Compiler they really buy into Synopsys. And the assurance that they will be able to stay up to date and in many cases they do contracts that allow them to get the next version of the tool. And of course if there is a change in price for the next version of the tool they will have to pay for that difference. But it makes it for a smooth outlook and a high degree of assurance to have low risk transitions and get the best technology at any point in time.", "This applies not only tow the implementations though it absolutely applies also the verification flow and with verification Compiler this is another example of fairly radical new improvement while at the same time putting together multiple capabilities at originally were partially available only in isolation, so individual products. And from a value point of view this is a very high value because if you use a simulator and you want to very quickly debunk something simulate again maybe verify some of the aspects by using the verification IP. This is all available in one product that granted will be more expensive than just a simulator but from a value per price ratio is enormously attractive for the customer so fundamentally our job is to -- pardon the expression techonomically both the technical and economic match more as well everybody of the week and so far we\u2019ve done that.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest", "Thanks. I think we should now have on the EVE -- is it the hardware upgrade or is it software upgrade? And then could talk about what do you think is the installed base of EVE and do you think those people now since you have a new generation of the tool will upgrade that? And maybe you could -- sorry go ahead.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, so the EVE ZeBu Server-3 is a complete new hardware machine. Now with the hardware comes in an enormous amount of software because this is -- this is very complex device that essentially maps the design that one wants to simulate on the internal hardware structure of that machine. And so the upgrades of both hardware and software but this is truly a new machine. Now a number of people essentially when they add machines, they decide which generation they want to add and mostly people will gravitate fairly quickly to the most advanced machines because they\u2019re too the value per price invariably is the best ratio. We see an opportunity to sell more and actually you\u2019ve heard from my preamble that we have already a number of customers that are moving in that direction.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest", "Maybe could you take a stab at where do you think your market share in emulation can be? I mean it has lagged to the other two guys of the market.", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, we\u2019ve never disclosed installed base or market share. At this point in time, we\u2019re clearly the number three in the markets so that\u2019s another way of say there is a lot of opportunity. ", "Operator", "Okay, we\u2019ll now to line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart a geographic question for you first. Would it be fair to say that the very substantial sequential and year-over-year increase in Asia-Pac revenues were highly correlated to the increase you saw in your IT and software solutions business. And if that was the case, do you think that the disproportionate growth or consumption of IT is Asia-Pac can continue? Also in that part of the world do you may recall that a quarter ago we talked about the possibility that Japan might be bottoming for EDA though that\u2019s not yet ready to inflect higher but in the quarter you saw further decline in the Japan business, was that currency for the structural weakness or what you\u2019re thinking now about some possible bottoming for EDA in that part of the world?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, so let me take them in reverse order. Japan actually it is not a decline of our business. The numbers that you see here are currency related. Now there is no question that Japan is sort of going through the hopefully the end of the their two last decades because enormous amount of change happening in the country in general and specifically in the high tech and semiconductor markets you see number of consolidations you see a number of things changing. Synopsys is now particularly well there and we expect that to continue and certainly hope that the technical talent that\u2019s in Japan will find now a renewal phase given that their sophistication is actually quite high and connecting more to the world market is really the opportunity there. Talking about Asia-Pac, I think there are many elements there because Asia-Pac of course on one hand is a number of countries that have been highly technical for many years specifically Taiwan and Korea.", "And now at same time have China becoming a larger and larger in terms of its role of utilization but also in developments of chips and absorption of chips domestically. And so that country of course has come later to the high tech market and what we invariably see when new countries come to any field is that they almost immediately start on whatever the latest design methodology is. So there the question was not so much outsourcing of design one used to do it\u2019s just outsourcing periods meaning you start write away with building blocks that are commercially available and one grows firm there. And so I think the opportunity space is very good for us there as we expect that market will continue to grow and it\u2019s on mythologies that\u2019s Synopsys has a lot to offer in. And so I think that AP will be - continues to be a strong market.", "Operator", "Can you still hear? Okay then our last set of questions then will come from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Brian, question on the offshore cash. What is your plan for that? My question more specifically, what do you expect the tax law changes to happen -- what do expect in terms of tax changes over the next couple of years and how does your strategy with the offshore cash change with that?", "Aart de Geus", "As I think earlier in terms of M&A opportunities and growth outside of the United States, we believe our cash that is outside this country will remain there permanently. We have 100% permanent reinvestment position on the tax side and that is just where we will keep that offshore and we can borrow domestically at a lower cost than what we have, but it also to point out there is not a significant amount of cash offshore we\u2019re talking $600 million to $700 million and we would expect that to continue there under the current tax regime.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Then one question for Aart in terms of your assumption for the core EDA growth of 3% to 5% where is that -- what are you assumption on that growth? Are you assuming the number of seats increasing or the content increasing? Can you elaborate on that one and maybe also talk about why can\u2019t we get a higher growth rate considering the rising complexity and consolidated supply base? I would think that you should be able to get better growth rate than what you\u2019re forecasting for core EDA?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay let me go backward on that on the growth rate first. I think it\u2019s always little bit difficult to predict exactly where this ends up, but clearly we are for the core of that business inside of the semiconductor industry and so the semiconductor industry now 3-4 years in a row has had the growth rate of 2% to 3%. So in that sense we are getting a bigger share of that value change than our semiconductor customers at times. And that is the heart of where some of this challenges are it\u2019s not a question of can we offer more value and make more difference and I think overtime there is certainly an opportunity for EDA to continue to grow a higher rate than semiconductors. If we look at where the value goes, I think the number of design seats will grow gradually partially because in Asia-Pac for the earlier question there will be more and more designers coming on board.", "But mostly the value goes into higher degree of absorption of multiple copies of the same tools for the same engineer and that\u2019s mostly limited by the cost of the hardware to run it on. And so that sort of the balance of the equation, now I would add one more thing for us which is new and in the few quarters will gradually I think communicate more to you as we learn more is the fact that for the first time in our existence are certainly in our recently existence - we have a dramatically broader potential customer base. Meaning people we\u2019ve never talked to and that is because as we enter or as we know have entered with the leadership position in the quality test and security verification of software.", "We are talking too many companies that do software that is not visibly liked to semiconductors because they\u2019re running things on the computers. Now you can argue computers are semiconductors but the fact is most of those people do extremely complex project with all the challenges of errors and bugs and maintenance and you have what not and they are now needing increasingly the same level of quality that semiconductors have needed already 20 years ago. And so from that perspective, our outlook is going to be positively enhanced by the fact that first time we can talk to the customers that we have never met in the first place. So there is also a lot of learning but also opportunity.", "Operator", "Thank you. Please continue.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think we\u2019re at the top of the hour which is sort of our cutoff point. Thank you so much for attending our earnings release. I hope that you took away that we have the strong results with a lot of exciting moving parts specifically great-great advances on the technology side and a broadening of the total TAM that Synopsys is looking at. And those are certainly exciting developments looking at our future and we hope to have your support going forward.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions).Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today\u2019s earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "", "Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to report excellent fiscal third quarter results. Customer demand was strong; we shipped game-changing new products that have already started a multi-year upgrade cycle; and we achieved encouraging results through Coverity, the recent acquisition that expands our TAM into a brand new software quality, test and security space.", "Highlighting our financial results. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $522 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, and $340 million in operating cash flow. For the year, based on the combination of solid organic growth and Coverity results, we\u2019re raising the midpoint of non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $2.48 to $2.50. We are narrowing our 2014 revenue range to $2.055 billion to 2.065 billion. In addition, we\u2019re raising our operating cash flow guidance to at least $500 million.", "Before moving on to highlights for the quarter, let me comment on the customer landscape. Semiconductor company results have been trending better over the past couple of quarters, primarily reflecting good production volumes. At the same time, stress levels have not really changed. Semi and systems companies worldwide face significant challenges \u2013 how to deal with global economic caution and navigate a very competitive market, while meeting unprecedented technical mandates in both hardware and software. The result is that both vertical and horizontal consolidations, be it by acquisition or divestiture, have continued. While this dynamic is not new, it makes semiconductors an evolving, yet exciting industry. ", "From a design perspective, the state-of-the-art push into smaller dimensions and much larger transistor counts continues unabated. Since these chips provide an enormous amount of compute power, both the amount of embedded software and the number of new software applications are growing at an impressive rate. Synopsys is uniquely positioned to be the partner of choice for companies facing these challenges", "We lead in chip implementation. We have a comprehensive solution for verification that reaches all the way up to the intersection of hardware and software. We\u2019re the number two IP company in the world. And with the acquisition of Coverity, we\u2019ve not only significantly expanded our portfolio and customer base, but are transforming Synopsys into its next incarnation.", "Let me now focus on highlights in the different areas, beginning with Core EDA. Looking at the implementation flow, one recognizes three technical segments: First, the FinFET-based, leading-edge designs ranging from 22 nanometers down to test and early production-designs at 10 nanometer. Second, the grouping centered around 28 nanometer, including 45 and 20, designing very advanced chips, but holding back to jump into FinFET until processes mature a bit. ", "And lastly, designs in established nodes ranging from 55 nanometer to 350 nanometer, and often specializing in applications requiring more analog, high voltage, or other market-specific demands. Synopsys is strong in all three categories with leadership especially visible in the first two.", "Commenting on the extremely fast-growing FinFET segment. It\u2019s quite astounding to see how intense the competitive battles are among the silicon providers, and how fast the node succession from 22 to 16/14 to 10 nanometer is progressing. Synopsys has invested for almost a decade in this area.", "At latest count, we\u2019re already tracking over 150 FinFET designs and tapeouts worldwide. Synopsys is integral to more than 95% of them. Clearly, from a technical point of view, Moore\u2019s Law is alive and well, and Synopsys is central in driving it forward.", "During the quarter, we announced broad foundry support for Intel\u2019s 14 nanometer Tri-Gate platform, extending our production-proven 22 nanometer design enablement to this new process. Already heavily used to design Intel\u2019s own production Tri-Gate chips, Synopsys\u2019 broad offering of digital and custom design tools, digital and analog simulation, as well as memory and interface IP, enables Intel\u2019s foundry customers to be confident in their ability to design very advanced chips. We also announced broad FinFET collaborations with Samsung and TSMC \u2013 including availability of a wide range of design tools and IP.", "Touching all three segments, our custom and mixed-signal tools are making solid progress. Specifically, the integration of IC Compiler and Custom Router is seeing excellent success with customers needing to bring digital and analog design together. At the Design Automation Conference, for example, Fujitsu and Renesas highlighted 4 to 15X productivity gains, and our solution has already been used in more than 50 tape-outs.", "Based on intense customer interest across the design spectrum, the introduction of our new IC Compiler II is clearly the highlight of 2014, and a milestone in design automation. This next generation tool delivers an astounding 10X improvement in throughput. That\u2019s 10X, not 10%. Since announcing IC Compiler II in March, we delivered its production version exactly on schedule last month. The number of customer engagements has grown very rapidly, and we have booked our first orders. So far, the accelerating number of tape-outs has been in 40, 28 and 16/14 FinFET designs, and the first chips have already successfully come back from manufacturing.", "Let me give you a sense of the impact customers are already seeing with IC Compiler II. Last week a very important customer reported that, to their own astonishment, on a large block of one of their most advanced chips, the difficult placement and clock optimization runtime, which is typically about 45-plus hours for them, with IC Compiler II came down to an amazing six and a half hours. Needless to say, this is not only a fabulous productivity increase, but also allows the design team to now do multiple iterations per day. We expect IC Compiler II adoption to begin a broad ramp up in 2015. ", "The thus enabled massive growth in chip and system complexity puts the spotlight squarely on verification, where we also made great progress with the Q2 announcement of Verification Compiler. Shown to deliver 3X productivity improvements, Verification Compiler features brand new core technologies in static and formal verification, the integration of software-based simulation and debug tools, as well as key verification IP, all in a single product. Interest is even higher than expected \u2013 leading to a solid pipeline and orders already in hand. As customers understand the impact of what Synopsys is doing in verification, we\u2019ve had a number of key commitments to long-term collaboration in this area. Overall, in core EDA, we see a lot of activity and expect generally low-to-mid single digit organic growth on a multi-year basis.", "Now turning to IP and prototyping. In IP, this quarter we note a number of successes with both current and next-generation products. We see significant USB 3.0 traction, as some major customers are well into volume production, while others are ramping up new design efforts. We estimate that 100 million Synopsys-powered USB 3.0-based chips have shipped thus far.", "During the quarter we unveiled the industry\u2019s first complete PCI Express 4.0 solution. Targeted at enterprise computing applications such as servers, networking, and storage systems, we\u2019re doubling the performance over the previous standard. Most importantly, in Q3 we also launched IP Accelerated. After pioneering IP-based design for almost two decades, several years ago we set out to transform IP integration and make it radically easier for designers to benefit from third-party IP. Along with the IP, we\u2019re now delivering a complete set of models, FPGA prototypes, test structures, driver software, and a host of other integration mechanisms. ", "This complete solution not only speeds up the integration of large quantities of IP while reducing the risk of costly errors, but it also accelerates the essential path to software. IP Accelerated sets the bar for sophisticated IP and directly impacts designer productivity and success. The reception from customers has been excellent. On the prototyping side, demand for HAPS FPGA products is driven by the steeply increasing need for hardware/software integration, which brings me to the new software space that we entered with the acquisition of Coverity. ", "This market is characterized by a $500 million TAM, high growth, an imperative for companies of all sizes developing software, and great potential for Synopsys. Coverity provides the essential testing software used during code development to find and fix critical defects. Defects not found during development are much more expensive to find in the Quality Assurance phase. Defects not found at all can jeopardize the quality or security of a product. While we\u2019re still in the early stages of building this business, I do have some highlights to share. In the first few months, Coverity is right on track financially.", "As a reminder, we indicated last quarter that we expect Coverity to contribute $20 million to $25 million in revenue, and be $0.10 to $0.13 dilutive in fiscal 2014 due to the deferred revenue impact of purchase accounting. We expect this part of our business to reach break-even in the second half of fiscal 2015, and be accretive in 2016. While Coverity did a great job building a $75 million standalone company, combining with Synopsys \u2013 one of the largest software companies in the world brings new benefits to target customers.", "In one interaction with a major global energy company, their management indicated strong satisfaction that this mission-critical software is now coming from a large company with financial strength, stability, and long-term vision.", "Recall that half of Coverity\u2019s customers are brand new to Synopsys, representing a completely new pool of potential buyers. The other half are companies we know well, but where Coverity is used in different parts of the company and accessing different budgets.", "We\u2019ve spent the last several months focusing on bringing in business and assessing the go-forward strategy. We anticipate sharing more with you over the next couple of months \u2013 please, stay tuned. IP and Software Solutions contribute approximately 25% of our revenue, and we expect to see low-double-digit revenue growth on a multi-year basis.", "In summary, we executed well in Q3. We solidified the year\u2019s financial outlook with an excellent quarter, and raised operating cash flow guidance; we delivered game-changing technology that extends our competitive differentiation for years to come. And we made good progress on our new journey into the software quality, test, and security market with Coverity.", "Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with guidance for Q4 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets we provided in May.", "Q3 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels, solid growth in both revenue and earnings, and considerable cash flow generation. Total revenue was $522 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. As expected, revenue from Coverity product sales was modest, reflecting the post-acquisition purchase accounting haircut to", "deferred revenue.", "About 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and we had one slightly greater than 10% customer. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 3.1 years, and we continue to expect weighted average duration for FY14 to be approximately three years.", "Turning to expenses, Q3 total GAAP costs and expenses were $455 million, which included $33 million of amortization of intangible assets and $21 million of stock-based compensation. Q3 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $397 million, slightly below our target range, driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses, including some delayed hiring, along with overall cost control.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.9% for the quarter and 23.5% for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, reflecting increases in headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions, primarily Coverity. Our ongoing goal is a continued focus on operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.42, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.65. Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 17.5% reflecting our release of certain reserves due to the lapse of several statutes of limitation during the quarter. As a result, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% is a reasonable estimate for FY14.", "Now turning to our cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $340 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to at least $500 million. We paid back our outstanding $200 million revolver, along with $7.5 million of our term loan, leaving $83 million of debt outstanding on the term loan. ", "Consequently, we did not repurchase stock in the quarter; however, for the trailing 12 months we have spent $155 million repurchasing approximately 4.1 million shares and we have $420 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $903 million with 12%, or $109 million, onshore and 88% offshore. We plan to continue optimizing the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of M&A, stock buybacks and debt reduction.", "Each quarter we will evaluate the best uses of cash, but our ongoing goal is to allocate capital to where we think it can generate maximum long-term shareholder value.", "DSO was 42 days, reflecting strong cash collections and timing of invoices, and we ended Q3 with 9,225 employees, with more than one third in lower-cost geographies.", "Now let\u2019s address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For fiscal 2014. We are narrowing our revenue range to $2.055 and $2.065 billion. While we are not breaking out Coverity product sales, we are on-track for the expected $20 to $25 million of revenue in FY14.", "Other income and expense between $10 million and $12 million; A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%; Outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.63, which includes the impact of approximately $80 ", "million in stock-based compensation expense, and we are increasing the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share target with a range of $2.48 to $2.50, which reflects Coverity on track for the expected $0.10 to $0.13 cents dilution in FY14.", "Capital expenditures of approximately $105 million, slightly less than originally anticipated due to some shifting out of expenditures to build out our newly leased Bay Area facility. And again we are again raising our cash flow from operations target to at least $500 million for FY14", "For the fourth quarter of FY14, our targets are; Revenue between $537 million and $547 million; GAAP costs and expenses between $462 million and $479 million, which includes approximately $22 million of stock-based compensation expense.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $410 million and $420 million, reflecting traditionally higher Q4 expenses; Other income and expense between $1 million and negative $1 million; A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%; Outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.32 to $0.38 per share; and ", "Non-GAAP earnings of $0.59 to $0.61 per share.", "We also reiterate our multi-year goal of high-single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. We continue to believe this strategy will deliver long-term shareholder value. It allows us to not only fund our strategic growth areas and expand our technology leadership, but simultaneously drive sustainable, long-term growth and increased profitability.", "In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our strong Q3 results, highlighted by solid top and bottom-line growth and considerable cash flow generation.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) You have a question from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Thank you. Aart just wanted to get your take on any incremental change, if you\u2019ve seen any in the environment it sounds like it\u2019s pretty similar to what you\u2019re describing last quarter, but just wanted to hear it from you, what if anything, you\u2019re seeing incrementally from relative to last quarter?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Sure. So in general, my own perception is that the things have not really changed all that much. Because the major forces in the semiconductor industry or essentially the same then they were a quarter ago. At the same time and you would see that from many of the analyst, everybody is reporting slightly better numbers, slightly higher expectations. And that of course is a good sign, but given that the fundamentals from my perspective have not changed all that much, I think steady as she goes. Having said that what is very, very positive is I think that\u2019s the acceleration on the FinFET side, gives more, more credence that there is a whole wave of new capabilities coming.", "And as FinFET technology manifest itself in more domains than just the advanced computation, the advanced graphics, all of the advanced heavy computationally centered chips, I think that will fuel really, the next wave of growth and many companies are very much aiming at consolidating their business picture to be ready for that.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "That\u2019s helpful. Question on IC CII, I think the way you\u2019ve described it in the past is that IC CII is for your customers at advanced nodes that would really benefit from the improved performance there, while those at some of the trailing nodes that may not needed as much wouldn\u2019t necessarily choose to upgrade. Can you give us a sense of how you see your customer base percentage wise at what percent do you think is at sufficiently advanced nodes that they might would upgrade to IC CII versus those that you don\u2019t think will? Do you have any sense of that percentage?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Let me first half agree and half disagree with you. Let me start with agreeing completely with the fact that all the people working on the very advanced nodes, absolutely, will upgrade as soon as they can to IC Compiler II, because the capabilities that are in there that are necessary for FinFET at 16, 14 and for sure at 10 nanometer are of extremely high value. And simultaneously the fact that the chips that you will do, they will have so many more transistor therefore are so much higher complexity will require the strength that the engines have that are in IC Compiler II.", "The part where it may be humbly would re-vector your thinking is actually all the existing nodes. One of the things that is quite remarkable and we have now many experiments to show this is that by using the capabilities in the most advanced tools are much more well established nodes and that can be 45 or 65 or even all the nodes than that result in a much better results on those chips.", "And we\u2019ve done a AV comparisons where we\u2019ve taken chips that have been designed in the past and just rerun them with the new tools and in a number of situations we can do the very same chip with fewer layers of metal. Well, one has to appreciate what that means fewer layers of metal means significantly lower cost manufacturing. And so the reason for this is not only all the many new deep technical features in IC Compiler II, but in order to deal with the complexity the engines have been massively overhauled to be much faster than before. And therefore we can tend to computations that in the past we couldn\u2019t do. So, I think the impact well maybe not as urgent as on the new nodes, will be very quickly visible in the coming year to people doing more established design.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "And I guess just try to ask the question again that just in terms of percentage so, it sounds like even folks at 65, could see significant benefit. Do you have a sense of your user base at 65 nanometer and below or do you think about your base that way?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, actually we think of it really in to sort of three categories I tried to hint at that in my preamble which is really the FinFET which is clearly very advanced those people will all ago. The group around 28 which is I stretch it a little bit to you from 45 to 20 really cover all the high-end planar transistors. I think they will all go. And I think the nodes before that people will gradually go overtime and we\u2019ll try to incentivize them in a number of years to make sure that they all go.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "", "And in terms of the percentage of your customer base that comprises 45 to 20.", "Aart de Geus", "", "45 to 20 I would say all the advanced people are there because all the advanced people do designs there and some do a portion at the FinFET level and clearly I would guess that something well over 50% of our revenue hit there.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "", "Great and just one more from me. I don\u2019t think you meant this to be a change but in your description of core EDA you talked about a low to mid single digit core EDA growth is that I think I felt maybe in the past you talk about a low single digit I\u2019m not sure if low to mid is the same or is it different just wanted to clarify that.", "", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, there is no change \u2013 no change intended in any case.", "Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Company", "Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate that.", "Aart de Geus", "", "You\u2019re welcome, Rich.", "Operator", "", "Okay thank you. And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, hi thanks for taking my question. Actually I have a couple of them. One is for Brian if you just do the mid point of a guidance for fiscal Q4 the EPS comes around $0.63 I\u2019m just kind of curious what is going on in your assumption on getting to the bottom line for Q4?", "Brian Beattie", "Well, again we had a coming off a very strong Q3 where we saw again our run rate increased during the quarter and even forecasting additional revenue growth going into the fourth quarter, so good performance, good year-over-year, nice sequential revenue that we\u2019re anticipating as I built that into the revenue guidance. And then on the spending profile we also see some growth we managed expenses very tightly during the quarter we have some level of deferred hiring if you like that will come into the fourth quarter.", "And just managing expenses so we\u2019re seeing expenses pick up a little bit very traditional for us in the fourth quarter to see that profile. So overall just a reminder we\u2019ve increased the mid point of our EPS guidance from last quarter by about $1.5. So overall again a good strong year making the commitments we committed to at the beginning of the year and continue to grow through.", "", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then your full year guidance roughly around $2.50 in EPS and earlier in the year it is almost $2.60 in the $0.10 dilution from the accounting with Coverity and you also mentioned that expect to grow EPS in the high single-digit, it\u2019s kind of range. So without giving any guidance and I know you guys are not going to guide for next year yet. Should we assume the high single-digits growth for EPS from the 250 base or 260 base for next year?", "Aart de Geus", "Again, in terms of our commitment, we\u2019ve made this for many, many years now, just our ongoing multiyear commitment of high single-digit earnings per share growth, and clearly of course we\u2019re focused on growth. And the impact we had anticipated for this year plus the impact of what we saw from Coverity brought us to lower number, but we want to highlight that even without that acquisition, we\u2019d be just over 7% earnings per share growth on a year-over-year basis and any commentary now on 2015 is really exactly the kind of work we\u2019re undertaking right now of getting ready for our plans of getting that setup and to be able to communicate as we normally do on the very next earnings call on our anticipation and guidance for 2015.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Final question for Aart. I\u2019m kind of curious your any updated thoughts on capital returned in the form of either dividend are more aggressive buybacks and along the same path, if you still think the best value from M&A \u2013 is there any pocket that makes more sense for you in other words do you think you get best bang for your buck in doing acquisitions in the IP side or is there anything else if you can give us inside us some insight that the very helpful?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. The capital allocation is something that really gets looked at every quarter again. Although we sort of follow general principles, which is the highest weighting is given into the opportunity of doing M&A that transforms positively the company for the future. Because capital is very valuable assets and given that it\u2019s split in domestic and international, one has to actually navigate to fairly careful waters.", "The second application of the capital would be for buybacks. And in the last 12 months I think we\u2019ve done $155 million or something like that. Last quarter, we didn\u2019t because we did the Coverity acquisition and we pay back the debts that came with that. And in general, our sense is that we would like to keep the ability to have that, so that we have optionalty in case good opportunities come up. And otherwise we are just disciplined. And lastly, dividend is something that we have not considered. We think the other two ways of using the capital base or better.", "Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Krish.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co", "", "Thanks, guys. I want to start with the contract duration. I think the 3.1 years that\u2019s a pretty healthy jump. Wondering if that\u2019s a couple of contracts that skewed it? Or did you see that lengthening across the spectrum of contracts in the quarter?", "Brian Beattie", "", "Yes, good question Sterling. The commitment we always make each year is that we expect our average duration of our licensed contracts to be about three years. We\u2019ve been running a little bit less than that during the first two quarters. The last quarter was really related to one significant deal that came in that had a longer duration to it. So all of that as you know we break it out to effectively one decimal point and that came out of 3.1 years. So, again, we reiterate about three years is the appropriate duration and that\u2019s what we\u2019re on track to deliver in 2014.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co", "And can you just maybe described how that may have impacted your that longer contract length, how that may have impacted you revenue outlook here for the fourth quarter given your spreading it out over a longer period?", "Brian Beattie", "Yes, it doesn\u2019t, again it doesn\u2019t affect it right. We do look at that revenue run rate, which again we said was up in the quarter. And as we look at a longer term deal, it\u2019s just one specific deal that came through and a good deal for everyone involved. And again that just factors into revenue guidance going forward.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co", "And can you give us a sense on Aart, you mentioned FinFET opportunity, what is FinFET doing to the IT business?", "Aart de Geus", "", "It is actually driving a lot of IT business, because if you take one step back, in order for a foundry to be successful with a silicon offering, there are many things that have to come together. And of course they themselves are in charge of the technology, the transistor development and the manufacturing capabilities and the manufacturing capacity. But they also rely on others such as Synopsys to do at a minimum two or three things. One is to make sure that the tools are completely ready for whatever idiosyncrasies technology may have and they all have idiosyncrasies and these are very important.", "Secondly, they want to make sure that libraries and memories which are very closely related to silicon already, we have a business there and we are very involved and providing those cores to the foundries at an early stage, because otherwise they cannot go to market. Then there\u2019s all the other IP, the interface IP and other providers provide processor cores and graphics cores that have to get ready.", "And lastly we provide a substantial amount of methodology help so that a customer can start designing and the whole flow is ready and proven and so on. And so the very fact that there is such a push on advanced FinFET has brought a wave of work on us. Now, you would say, work that\u2019s a native. No. It\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s an opportunity to drive the state-of-the-art forward and we\u2019re very deeply enmeshed in that. So in that sense, the FinFET wave from my perspective is another easy 10-year, easy is the wrong word, guarantees 10 years of Moore\u2019s law and we\u2019re very involved in making that happen.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co", "", "Okay and last question Brian on the non-GAAP sales and marketing expense I think it was a $107 million in terms of few million dollars shy of what we\u2019re thinking, looking at the sequential change and that may have come in below what I would have thought. Anything that you didn\u2019t do in the quarter whether it be from advertising or marketing or head count, what kind of explain the sales and marketing result?", "Brian Beattie", "Delayed hiring its all about the looking very carefully at all the plant growth and really kind of fine tune comb on what\u2019s available what\u2019s coming in what\u2019s essential and just managing it very carefully so again it just timing relative to bringing that in and managing cost.", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co", "Got it. Thank you guys.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Yes, good afternoon. First, something on the question IC Compiler II, so after first quarter what kind of feedback do you get from the customers as far as you taking this market leading product to making it 10 times faster what kind of impact do you see on just the market size?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, I think this is a great opportunity for us because its not just a product, it is really a platform that touches many other capabilities and products and when we say there is 10x improvement and throughput really implies through many, many different tasks. And so we have no many reports from customers on all kinds of different tasks or the run time improvement and its more difficult for customers to judge what happens when you go through all of the stages because that implies going through entire chip design. But for each of the tasks, they are seeing remarkable improvements in run time. ", "And in my preamble I try to use one example of where run time it\u2019s not just a \u2013 well it goes faster, it\u2019s a \u2013 now I can do a two or maybe three times a day. And one should not under estimate how valuable that is because that allows people to look at results and say, oh, no I should have changed something to get better results. And they can immediately go back into implementation and thus progress faster towards their overall chips. So the results of all of this is that I think it is not only the tool that is needed to really anchor the design of the next generations of technology and I would certainly include 28 nanometer in that. It is also the basis to change design methodology and it\u2019s almost fun to hear, some of customers say well now that this so fast, why don\u2019t you make everything else faster too. And so the usual when you have something good immediately the expectations go for.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Do you think essentially the result is more testing versus fewer seats or fewer packages.", "Aart de Geus", "", "When you say more testing, you mean there is the opportunity to explore many more design much more rapidly. Yes.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. I was kind of curious if that, maybe you thought that once you had a kind of a slug of refresh go through with your customers, if at that point the speed actually would decrease the market size, but its sounds like do you think there is so much more \u2013 so many more cycles you can do to get the reliability up that would\u2026", "Aart de Geus", "Absolutely. I think we often don\u2019t realize how enormously the complexity of chips is increasing. And partially we take it for granted because our entire industry actually delivers incredibly well against this sort of mythical Moore\u2019s law. But the fact is that the chips that are being built are enormously complex and the fact that entire phases of this have been automated to this degree is remarkable. And I have no doubt whatsoever that\u2019s the fact that the products run so much faster. Just means that they will see more utilization on more parts.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. And then Brian, when you look at the Coverity acquisition on the fact that\u2019s dilutive until the second half of next year, is that driven by just the differed revenue make up or do you need actual growth in Coverity proper to get to accretion.", "Brian Beattie", "", "Yes, the reason for that dilution is really all related to the differed revenue haircut. And it does effect as you know where the rate will model beyond just this year. It does go into next year as well. So from a cash flow perspective the company is break-even from an earnings perspective, prior acquiring it was a break-even business. Coupled along with a very nice roughly 20% revenue growth associated with that. So we do plan on growing that business, growing the market potential it\u2019s there and also to drive profitability up overtime. But really that biggest impact to your question is \u2013 is really coming from the deferred revenue haircut again, so it\u2019s a non-cash item, cash flow the company has done very well.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were putting enough extra investment into at where as the current revenue run rate it wasn\u2019t quite profitable yet.", "Brian Beattie", "We\u2019re building that in as well as we look ahead. ", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay, thanks. And then I guess Aart final question when you look at the emulation market I guess two questions here. First one, do you think it is ultimately a $1 billion market like some are saying at this point. And the second question is, is this one of your key focuses at this point?", "Brian Beattie", "", "Well, $1 billion dollar is a pretty far away from where the market is today. On the other hand, I think there is plenty of indication that faster and faster simulation requires hardware and emulation is the central piece of that. And one of the key reasons for that is tied actually to the previous comment on the complexity of chips, which is when you look at the advanced chips, what is customary to date if you have one, two, four, 18 God knows how many compute cores.", "Well, the implication is having processor cores means there's software that goes with that, having software means that you would like to verify that software in context of the chip without having to chip and this is where both emulation and FPGA-based prototyping are absolutely essential. So I see the entire market engineering putting more and more emphasis now on this intersection between hardware and software. And it\u2019s in that context that emulation has probably very high potential as we are looking at system validation which contains both hardware and software.", "Tom Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Well, thank you both for your time today.", "Brian Beattie", "You\u2019re welcome", "Aart de Geus", "", "Thanks Don.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities", "Yes, thanks good afternoon Brian, first question about the results and then Aart couple of longer term questions. Brian could you comment on the unusually large sequentially increasing revenues in North America, while at the same time we also had a fairly large sequential decline in Asia Pacific in the second quarter perhaps the latter is seasonal because you had something similar last year, but what are the moving parts behind those two large moves in sequential revenues geographically?", "Brian Beattie", "Again, all of this under a very, very ratable revenue profile. So, as you know from time-to-time there is a little bit of revenue variability. We\u2019ve addressed that and Asia-Pacific before its relative to one contract that\u2019s in place. It just moves around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. So again, it\u2019s just a continuation of the trend on a quarterly basis everything is totally on track. And as you\u2019re seeing in Asia-Pacific our trailing 12 months revenue is up 15%, compared to 12 months earlier so good performance through the whole region. And then just relative to North American again you can see the same thing now with Coverity starting to kick in and some additional specific businesses that we have, it\u2019s a good quarter. Overall, the business did well in North America in particular just looking at some record results for the U.S. right now.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities", "Okay, Aart with respect to IC COMPILER II, when the company hosted a meeting with investors at DeCA, there was an interesting discussion about the node-based pricing that you\u2019ve offered or introduced with IC Compiler II. The different capacities and prices having to do with the node for which the product would be used. Could you talk about whether that kind of approach to pricing is usable for other of your tools? Is that something you're planning to do? Also technically, would it be fair to say that you are working on or maybe you've already finished it increasing the capacity for DC commensurate with the capacity increases for IC Compiler II?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "Okay. Let me start first with the overall pricing. Attaching anything to nodes either very, very directly or through very specific features that are necessary for those nodes, applies much more to the implementation tools than let's say the verification tools because the implementation tools actually need to know what node it is where the verification tools in general treat a gate as a gate as a gate no matter what transistor's made up of. So in the case of our advanced tools and implementation, they are, a lot of this can be regulated or controlled really through the features that are available for the different nodes. Remind me what was your second question?", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities", "", "Sure. There was some discussion at DAC that just as you've increased the capacity for IC Compiler II, relative to predecessor, you might need to increase DC capacity similarly?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, yes and no. The yes part is no doubt that all the building blocks that are being created are going commensurately with the chips that are growing. And so in that sense, there\u2019s a never-ending push on all of our tools as a matter of fact to increase capacity or another way we say it is reduce the memory consumption per gate or per transistor and so that will continue on all of our tools.", "The only thing that is slightly difference between tools that look at the placement out of an entire chip versus the synthesis of individual blocks is the entire chip grows in absolute terms even more than the individual blocks. The other area where what you just said is very material is actually in the verification side. And they are too, the push for faster and lower memory utilization is remarkable. On the faster side that is of course what results into the push into emulation and FPGA-based prototyping. But the good news is I think we never done with the engineering that we have to do and Synopsys is well-differentiated in all these angles already.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities", "Okay, maybe lastly, thinking about longer-term incremental opportunities, for you specifically but perhaps more broadly for EDA, could you address those opportunities in three respects? One, by functional area particularly focusing on the opportunities you see in sign-off and power, you were quoted I think it was at DAC maybe it was at snug that power has its own specific optimization requirements. So maybe you could talk about that. Secondly by customer type in your prepared remarks you talked about foundries and specifically Intel custom foundry maybe talk about the opportunity there. And then lastly by end application, at the breakfast you guys with Global Foundries at DAC someone from Synopsys was quoted as saying that you are very aggressively pursuing the Internet of Things opportunity. So perhaps you could talk about what that really means for you.", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, realize of course that you're asking me to do multiple complete snug speeches here. But let me start a little bit by the functional area top down, we break our thinking into really only three or four areas the implementation, verification, the IP and now the interaction hardware software to software. On the implementation side, you\u2019re absolutely right to highlight power because the power touches everything. ", "And when I say everything I really mean from the most minute microscopic optimization of transistors that are done with tea CAD to the very choice of the materials and that\u2019s why you see so much emphasis in these new FinFET structures, all the way to of course how a chip is designed, the architecture. But then also how the software's run and the very fact that on a modern chip as you run software pieces of the chip are being turned on and off, thousands of times per second just to save a little bit of power gives you a sense of how important that is.", "And so the key for us is to make sure that all of our tools understand recently well what the other\u2019s tools are doing. In terms of the customer types, one can certainly look at the people providing the silicon. So the foundries or some of the IDM's that do it themselves. And there one needs to be engaged early on having the right connections to what will describe the technology so that the tools can use it well and be ready with early IP. ", "But just as important on the receiving end so the people that maybe fabless design companies, they are, the goal is to helps them make maximal utilization of new technology the minute they are available and the minute they are economically interesting to them. And the good news there is we have quite a number of substantial, large, hard to driving fabless companies that have teamed up with us on really driving the state-of-the-art forward.", "And then in terms of end application domains it is useful to understand what are the biggest markets because the biggest markets are a computation and communication. They intersect very much on the Internet which means that the cloud infrastructure is an area that keeps being invested in and everything I mentioned so far demands state-of-art technology going forward. ", "Internet of Things right now is a little bit catch all for so many different things. Somebody the other day jokes that every time you say the word Internet of Things, the market grows by another trillion or so. Well I think it\u2019s not that simple, there is going to be enormous large number of various simple chips collecting data measuring things, watching things and then the manipulation or the intelligent analysis will demand more and more chip in silicon technology in years to come.", "And so I think there are open opportunities there, but its also many specialties people that are really very good at doing something high voltage or low voltage or that are looking some analogs capabilities. So I think there is broad horizon in the Internet of Things is sort of the door to get a lot of information in but the hard core is all around computation and the transportation and storage of data as in all the advanced companies are massively betting on that.", "", "Operator", "Okay, thank you and the next question from the Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi this is (indiscernible) asking for Mahesh thanks for taking my questions. And Aart you talked a lot about things that progress in your prepared remark which is very helpful. But I wonder if you can talk about the development on the FD-SOI side what level of interest or traction do you in that area? And how Synopsys plan to address the demand there?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay let me go backwards with that which is we have been very competent on FDA, FD-SOI for actually quite a while and majority of the chip that have used that technology were taped out with our tools. Now the reason FD-SOI has come to the attention of a number of people is of course because there has been an agreement between FD and Samsung to invest jointly in that area, they will have to tell you exactly what they plan to deliver, but FD-SOI brings some of the promises of lower power to the 28 nanometer planar transistor wave. ", "And so the way to understand this is down to 28, 20 nanometer transistors have been planar. Read that as flat. FinFETs our vertical transistors, vertical as you would imagine are more difficult to build, more expensive to build but they have the benefit of having much lower power consumption going forward. And so it begs the question well when do you stop 28, 20 and when you jump over to the next wave. And quite a number of companies are right now essentially using 28 nanometer to the best of their abilities until FinFET becomes economically more mature. ", "And there's been the proposal to use FD-SOI as a way to get even better results out of 28 for a lower price. And so FD has had excellent results with this so it's promising, but the question remains, will there be broad foundry capacity for that? And if yes, I'm sure some customers will use it.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And there are five minutes remaining in this conference. The next question comes from the line of Monika Garg of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi, thanks for taking question. First question is for Brian, Brian if I look at the tax rate, the tax rate quarter-over-quarter for the yearly basis has gone down by 100 basis points, right? Which has pre-sensed the EPS, then you had a nice split on Q3 \u2013 by $0.05. But you're only raising your yearly guidance by couple of cents. So could you help us reconcile that?", "Brian Beattie", "", "Sure, then I will confirm the data points too. We've at a very good third quarter with our tax rate coming in reflecting a number of statutes of limitation. So it just really expired in our third quarter and in that quarter is basically a year-to-date catch-up if you like. And that has to flow through into our results. So that was a contributor into the earnings as we were able to release some reserves, we had setup.", "Our prior guidance on our tax rate for the year was 21% and now with those provisions coming in we're letting that to go down to 20% for the year. So again, that is being reflected in our guidance as we look forward relative to our guidance for the full year, we've included a $0.015 increase as we said we did really well inside the third quarter. And just looking at our typical fourth quarter with rising revenues we also see some rise in our expenses associated with the cost controls and some delayed hiring. We had in the third quarter. So overall good management of tax and again good earnings per share with some improvement in that now being forecast.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Then I have a question that we\u2019re seeing consolidation in the semi industry, right Broadcom kind of announced they\u2019re winding down, I think the baseband business. Could you maybe talk about a broader trend consolidation in semis and impact on EDA and also on Synopsys.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, this is why before, I mentioned that I think the market has not changed all that much. These consolidations in semiconductor side are not new and I think are just the natural evolution of any industry that periodically sort of re-centers itself on critical mass be it either vertical focus or horizontal focus.", "And I think it shows that we have a very active and alive industry. This is not any different for our own industry. There has been consolidation in the past. I think we also leave Synopsys in a position where we have a very good position and have had the opportunity to now look at broadening fields and as you know one of the acquisitions we did was Coverity that opened up a new TAM for us that previously was not there. So there's plenty of opportunity for us to look forward. In general, we don\u2019t comment about forward-looking M&A for the company.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "The last one for me (inaudible) side you had new to [lamination to the] March of this year. Could you maybe talk about how you think that is doing and the growth, what you are seeing in the segment?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. We introduced ZeBu 3 which is a brand new generation much faster, much higher capacity engine. And actually it has gotten very good reception from customers. Number of them have been shipped and are in utilization. This is part of a much broader strategy, which is really to deal with the very fact that verification is absolutely one of the areas that we\u2019ll see the biggest demand in new capabilities, faster speed, higher capacity et cetera because of the complexity of not just the chips but of the entire system and the interaction with hardware and software.", "And so in that context we\u2019re very happy that the new machine is in good state, and our focus is entirely now on the interaction between that and our other tools. And we will tell more about that towards the rest of the year.", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "", "Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.", "Aart de Geus", "", "You\u2019re welcome, Monika.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And back to you gentlemen for closing remarks.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you very much for spending time with us. We are looking back on a very strong quarter not only with good financial results, but also with some advances with very high impact a long-term products. And so it will be exciting to tell you about our progress in the coming quarters with these products. And their impact on the semiconductor evolution history.

Davidson", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities", "Monika Garg \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earning Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "", "Thank you, Sandy. Good afternoon, everyone. Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, the financial supplement and the corporate overview presentation that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q4 was a strong finish to a very solid year; a year that was significant from at least three perspectives. Specifically, we released several game-changing new EDA products that will drive a multi-year product upgrade cycle.", "We further broadened our IP offering, solidifying our position as the number 2 IP provider with a strong business outlook into FY15. And last, but not least, we embarked on a transformational journey into the software quality, test and security space with our acquisition, and integration, of Coverity.", "Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter and year. We delivered Q4 revenue of $539 million and $2.057 billion for the fiscal year. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 in Q4 and $2.53 for the year. We generated $551 million in operating cash flow, bought back $120 million of our stock, and grew our three-year backlog to $3.5 billion.", "Building on our strong year-end position, we're setting a 2015 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.67 to $2.72, a revenue target of $2.185 to 2.225 billion, and an operating cash flow target of approximately $450 million. Brian will discuss these in more detail shortly.", "As we head into 2015, it\u2019s clear that global demand for electronics continues unabated. From the newest mobile phones and tablets; to a cloud infrastructure that requires unprecedented amounts of data storage, transportation and analysis; to a whole new wave of innovative electronic content in Internet of Things applications - technology is king!", "In 2014, we have seen hard-driving adoption of the most advanced FinFET technologies, with already more than 170 active designs and tape-outs as far down as 10 nanometer.", "Meanwhile, designs at the more established 20, 28, and 40/45 nanometer nodes are also increasing in complexity as designers drive performance while squeezing out power and cost.", "In other words, the technical essence of Moore's law is alive and well, and the term system on a chip coined in the late 90s is in full swing. This product wave is also increasingly complex. Billions of transistors in massive numbers of interconnected chips, all with enormous amounts of embedded and applications software is, simply stated, very hard to do.", "Synopsys is at the vortex of this process. While 2014 semiconductor industry growth looks stronger compared to last year, the market remains extremely competitive, driving a number of customers to seek efficiency and differentiation through consolidation and restructuring.", "For the EDA industry, this brings some headwinds, but also great opportunities. In this context, Synopsys is the only vendor offering state-of-the-art solutions from Core EDA, to IP, to software quality tools, positioning us well to be the partner of choice.", "Given these dynamics, let me state our priorities for the next several years. While we continue to build on our strengths in EDA, we plan to accelerate our expansion into a more diversified set of customers and solutions. We\u2019re driving three priorities:", "Priority number 1: Maintain our clear technical, business and support leadership in core EDA.", "Our strategy for mostly organic growth is the following: First and foremost, invest in technology focused on continued leadership in FinFET solutions at 16 nanometer and below, as well as highest productivity for advanced design at the established process nodes.", "Second, drive customer success on a global basis. Today our support teams are integral to the completion of virtually all state-of-the-art chips. Synopsys will continue to provide highly skilled and trusted EDA experts at our customers' global locations.", "And third, deploy and proliferate the new game-changing design and verification products we introduced in 2014, and additional products to be announced in 2015.", "Priority number 2: Drive continued growth in IP and Systems, leveraging the confluence of increased outsourcing of IP, growing technical complexity, and the essential customer need for trust and reliance on its partner suppliers. In this area, our strategy for organic and potential M&A growth is the following.", "First, invest in and proliferate new titles across the portfolio, both in the most advanced silicon technologies and in more established geometries targeting the Internet of Things. With an offering that features interfaces, memories, embedded processors and analog IP, Synopsys is a cornerstone partner in the deployment of any new silicon technology generation.", "Second, provide increasingly complex, pre- configured IP subsystems to help ease integration into our customers' SoCs. And third, provide software-and hardware-based prototyping solutions to enable earlier software development and system validation with today's software-intense devices.", "Which brings me to our third strategic priority: Expand our presence in the software-quality, test and security space by building on the excellent technology from Coverity. Our strategy for organic and potential M&A growth is to leverage the just-completed Synopsys field integration, while focusing on fast and agile execution.", "We expect to grow in: A, the directly adjacent embedded software market, where we already know the electronic and semiconductor companies well, and can leverage Synopsys' global relationships built over many years.", "And, B, the large untapped software-applications market that reaches from financial to health, energy, retail, social media to virtually any company doing sophisticated software and having quality, security and testing issues.", "From a shareholder value perspective, these priorities drive a diversified and coherent product portfolio in both mature and growing markets, balancing both growth and profitability for Synopsys.", "Specifically, core EDA is very stable, with solid profitability and cash flow; IP delivers higher growth with increasingly good profitability; and the software quality tools are in a brand new TAM with an even better growth opportunity, with expected profitability in 2016.", "Let me provide some highlights for each of these, beginning with core EDA. In core EDA, the demand for the most leading-edge technology is unrelenting. I mentioned earlier the latest breakthrough process FinFETs. Of all the designs and tape-outs we\u2019re tracking, Synopsys is integral to over 95% of them.", "Being the leader makes a difference: customers can rest easy, knowing that they're relying on the most technically advanced tools, and support teams, in the world.", "Earlier this year, we launched a breakthrough in implementation: IC Compiler II. We indicated at that time that ICC II is a game-changer delivering a 5X speed-up and 10X throughput improvement.", "Now, six months later, we have even more hard evidence from many customers with excellent results. With a rapidly growing number of engagements, designs, tape-outs and now working silicon, we see our multi-year adoption and deployment progressing even faster than with any previous products.", "The benefits are equally compelling for both very advanced and established nodes. One such example is Panasonic, who achieved such excellent results with a high-performance multimedia design at 40 nanometer, that they\u2019re expanding use into other 40 and 28 nanometer designs.", "Moving to verification, where approximately 80% of advanced designs use Synopsys as their primary simulator, customers have responded extremely well to our Verification Continuum vision and first deliveries. Just as the name implies, the Verification Continuum platform spans all the key components, from our franchise VCS functional verification, to static and formal analysis, to verification IP, to emulation and prototyping, all aligned on a common infrastructure, with best-in-class, common debugging.", "With a 3X near-term and 10X long-term productivity improvement, our vision, plans and deliverables are already having impact on customers. The first deliverable, Verification Compiler, launched in Q2 with brand-new static and formal verification, the integration of software-based simulation and debug tools, and key verification IP, all in a single product. It is currently delivering 3X productivity improvement.", "Also launched this year was the next-generation ZeBu Server-3 emulator, which is the fastest, highest-capacity emulator on the market today. Stay tuned as we roll out additional components over the next year, starting in Q1.", "Around our tools, Synopsys continues to support, and benefit from, strong ecosystem partnerships, as evidenced by several announcements in the quarter. We expanded our long-standing collaboration with ARM to benefit our mutual customers with optimized tools throughout the flow for designing with ARM IP. This very broad, multi-year agreement gives us early access to the latest ARM processors.", "On the foundry side, we achieved broad certification for TSMC\u2019s 16 nanometer FinFET-plus process, for both digital and custom implementation tools. And both companies entered into a 10 nanometer FinFET collaboration.", "In addition, TSMC selected Synopsys as Partner of the Year in two categories: Joint development of 16 nanometer FinFET-plus design infrastructure, and for the fifth consecutive year, Partner of the Year for interface IP.", "Which brings me to highlights for our IP products, where demand is strong. Let me give you some examples: In Q4, we closed a multi-year agreement for 16, 14 and 10 nanometer IP outsourcing with AMD, and hired 150 of their engineers to augment our team. The advances in the most leading-edge technologies are progressing well, with the first 10 nanometer IP business wins with two industry leaders.", "Our interface IP is evolving continuously. Our USB 3.0, for example, has been shipped in more than 100 million production SoCs, while in Q4 we already launched our USB 3.1 controller with double the data rate. Finally, our IP is already used extensively in Internet of Things applications. During the quarter we announced a new Sensor and Control subsystem, and also an enhanced memory offering for embedded flash used for IoT and Automotive.", "Lastly, let me update you on Coverity. As a brief reminder, Coverity provides essential testing software used during code development. This software finds, and fixes, critical defects and security issues. Coverity is an ideal TAM expansion for us: About half the business addresses software embedded in chips and electronic systems from customers we know well; and half is aimed at a new, very broad set of application software customers.", "We\u2019ve spent the last two quarters learning about Coverity\u2019s products, customers, and market dynamics. The quality of the technology and employees is outstanding, and", "Coverity\u2019s results under Synopsys were in line with the initial expectations we communicated back in the spring. We expect to reach break-even in the second half of fiscal 2015, while being accretive in 2016 with revenue over $100 million.", "From an overall financial perspective, our primary long-term objective is to drive high-single-digit, non- GAAP earnings-per-share growth through a mix of the following elements: One, organically grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single digit range. Two, organically grow IP and Software Solutions revenue generally in the low double-digits. Three, actively explore TAM-expanding R&D and M&A opportunities.", "Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range; And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of M&A, debt reduction, and stock buybacks. While the combination of elements may vary, based on business cycles and in-period priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent.", "Before I conclude, let me also highlight today's organizational announcement. As we scale the company into its next phase, I am pleased that Brian has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Administrative Officer, and while continuing to lead finance, operations and IT, he will also head up human resources, facilities, business development, and strategy.", "Trac Pham, who has worked closely with Brian for many years as a key member of the finance team, will step into the CFO role. Many of you will meet and get to know Trac over the coming months. Brian will remain available in investor relationships as well. Congratulations to both Brian and Trac in their new roles.", "To conclude, Synopsys is in a high-potential position. Propelled by yet another decade of technology advancements, the electronics industry is gunning for the next wave of far reaching products. Synopsys is a cornerstone company enabling this new wave of innovation.", "In 2014, we built a very strong financial foundation, and we enter 2015 with a good deal of momentum. Our newly launched game-changing products are expected to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle, IP demand is strong, and our expansion into a new higher-growth software quality and security space enters its next, exciting phase.", "Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year and provide you with our targets for Q1 and the full year of 2015. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over year unless I specify otherwise.", "Synopsys delivered very good fourth quarter and full year results, highlighted by strong business levels, solid growth in both revenue and earnings, and considerable free cash flow generation. We significantly exceeded our original 2014 target for operating cash flow, entered an exciting new market segment with our Coverity acquisition, and continued our stock repurchase program.", "Q4 total revenue increased 7% to $539 million and annual revenue grew 5% to $2.057 billion. Revenue contribution from Coverity was modest and met our prior expectations. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and we had one approximately 10% customer for both Q4 and FY14.", "The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.8 years for the quarter and about 2.9 years for all of fiscal 2014. We currently expect weighted average duration for FY15 to continue to be approximately three years.", "Three-year backlog increased to $3.5 billion from $3.1 billion due primarily to the timing of large contract renewals, business growth and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. Looking ahead, we have approximately 80% of our target fiscal 2015 revenue in hand for the coming year.", "Turning to expenses, Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $482 million, which included $33 million of amortization of intangible assets and $21 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.81 billion, which included $126 million of amortization of intangible assets and $79 million of stock-based compensation.", "Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $423 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.58 billion, well within our expected range.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.6% and 23% for the full year, which reflects the approximately one percentage point impact from our Coverity acquisition and the standard purchase accounting haircut that is applied to deferred revenue. For all of FY15, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY14 levels by approximately 100 basis points.", "We continue to drive company-wide operational discipline, as well as implementing targeted cost savings initiatives, including a voluntary retirement program and some additional severance in the current quarter. As a result, in Q1 we expect to incur a one-time, GAAP-only restructuring charge between $15 and $19 million.", "Our strategy is to reduce expenses in certain areas so that we're able to allocate resources to our higher-growth areas such as IP and our new software quality and security arena.", "Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.39 for the quarter and $1.64 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14% to $0.64. Full year non-GAAP earnings grew 4% to $2.53 and again includes the dilution from Coverity, which came in within our target range.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14% in Q4 and 18% for the full year, both below our targets, due primarily to a cumulative favorable transfer pricing adjustment for 2014. For modeling purposes, we think that a more normalized non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2015.", "Now turning to our cash flow. We generated $173 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $551 million for all of fiscal 2014. FY14 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations, due primarily to strong business levels and collections throughout the year.", "During FY14, we borrowed and paid back both our outstanding $200 million revolver, initially drawn to acquire Coverity, and $30 million of our term loan, leaving $75 million of debt outstanding on the term loan.", "During fiscal 2014 we purchased about 3.1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $120 million that included 1 million shares for $40 million in Q4. We have $380 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our goal is to accelerate our buybacks in FY15 to keep our share count roughly flat with FY14 levels.", "We also closed a number of acquisitions during the fiscal year, putting our balance sheet to work. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $986 million with 16%, or $162 million, onshore and 84% offshore.", "We plan to continue optimizing the use of our very strong cash flow through a balance of M&A, stock buybacks and debt reduction. Each quarter we will evaluate the best uses of cash, but our ongoing goal is to allocate capital to where we think it can generate maximum long-term shareholder value.", "At this time we're targeting operating cash flow of approximately $450 million in FY15, which reflects about $35 million in one-time disbursements due to our voluntary retirement program and additional severance, and one-time benefits changes.", "We're also expecting cash taxes to be somewhat higher in 2015. And finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to prior years, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, due primarily to the timing of prior year annual incentive compensation payments.", "Capital expenditures were $45 million for the quarter and $103 million for the year, reflecting the increased facilities related expenditures, including the ongoing two-year build out of our newly leased Bay Area facility, along with facilities and other expenditures due to past acquisitions.", "DSO was 55 days, reflecting strong business levels and the timing of invoices, and we ended Q4 with approximately 9,440 employees, with over one third in lower-cost geographies. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by planned hiring and Coverity, along with the IP engineers we hired from AMD as part of our recently expanded IP partnership.", "Before moving onto guidance, let me provide some additional commentary on Coverity. As you recall, at closing, Coverity had about $69 million of deferred revenue, of which $47 million will not be recognized due to standard purchase accounting.", "As a result, FY14 revenue contribution would have been approximately $24 million higher without the deferred revenue haircut, and FY15 would be approximately $15 million higher. While we are not breaking out Coverity product sales, we believe we are on track to grow revenue in this space to more than $100 million in fiscal 2016.", "So now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the first quarter of FY15, our targets are: revenue between $535 and $545 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $482 and $505 million, which includes approximately $21 million of stock-based compensation expense and the one-time restructuring charge.", "Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $415 and $425 million. Other income and expense between $0 and $2 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%, outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million. GAAP earnings of $0.18 to $0.25 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.61 to $0.63 per share.", "Now our Fiscal 2015 outlook, revenue between $2.185 and $2.225 billion, a growth rate of approximately 6% to 8%. Other income and expense between $2 and $6 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%; outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million. GAAP earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.35, which includes the impact of approximately $88 million in stock-based compensation expense.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.67 to $2.72, which reflects Coverity being on track to reach break-even in the second half of 2015. Capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, and we are targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.", "And then finally, to assist in your modeling, second half revenue and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be slightly higher than the first half. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly toward the first half of the year.", "In summary, we're pleased with our very good fourth quarter and full year financial results, was highlighted by solid top-and bottom-line growth and strong cash flow generation.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. First congratulations Brian, on the promotion.", "", "Brian Beattie", "", "Thank you very much Rich.", "Rich Valera", "So Aart, just first wanted to take your pulse on the environment. It sounds from your prepared remarks that it is quite similar to last quarter but just wanted to hear in your words sort of how you would view the environment if there was any change quarter-over-quarter?", "", "Aart de Geus", "You characterize it right, which is its similar to last quarter. I think if you look at the year, semiconductor is looking a little stronger than last year but the reality is, it's an on and off and the rate of change is very high in the field that we're in, which is a good thing because that means that the technology adoption is raising forward.", "And we definitely see a number of companies looking at, at the coming years as opportunities for strong new product. So, one hand same old, same old. On the other hand, same old has always meant very rapid progress.", "Rich Valera", "", "That's great. And then with respect to ICC II it sounds like your \u2013 you're kind of on track with where we wanted to be. I'm assuming on track for GA end of this calendar year, is that still correct?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well we have brought release at the time. We are very careful of how to roll it out so that we can support to people that are adopting it very effectively which means that we're controlling quarter-by-quarter how many people we pick up.", "But definitely the customer interest is not an issue, its well on schedule. And what has been particularly rewarding is that the, there are really hard evidence on all the results is absolutely at least as good as what we have said it would be and so that is very encouraging.", "Rich Valera", "And I know you don\u2019t like to talk too much about share because its little tricky how it's measured and seems like everyone sort of gains share. But, when you look at the digital space where your - certainly the digital design space where you have quite high share. Do you think ICC II could enable you - to reflect the gain share or willing to make that go at this point.", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "Your comment is right. Everybody always claims that they\u2019re gaining share. The reality is things shift very gradually in the field that we're in and for starters, what of course ICC II does, it solidifies strongly on the places that we\u2019re in.", "But, given the substantial advantages in terms of productivity, this really gives us the opportunity to gain over time. And given that, many of the agreements that we have are multi-years, that is how this will roll out. The adoption is very, very rapid.", "", "Rich Valera", "Great. And just one final one, you had a very nice increase in backlog year-over-year despite a drop in duration. Wondering if you can give any more color on what drove that particularly if you\u2019d be willing to say how much Coverity contributed to that?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for starters, yes, it was a very - a very good increase and actually the most relevant in all of that is actually a different number, which is the very fact that we\u2019re entering the coming year with a very strong coverage, 80% or so.", "And, but you're right, that's the - Q4 grew the backlog substantially. I hadn't even noticed that\u2019s the duration has slightly changed because it's - from my perspective it\u2019s sort of all in the same ballpark. We don\u2019t really see much change there.", "So I think, we just had a very strong business result in Q4 that will manifest itself over the coming years. I guess that's called momentum", "Rich Valera", "That's great.", "Brian Beattie", "Rich, I think - just adding to that, it\u2019s just again reflective of a strong year with good level of business coming in, a very strong fourth quarter. And we just saw good renewals, good momentum on that and then it set us up nicely for 2015.", "Some of the acquisition work we did had a smaller impact but was also a contributor to that growth about $400 million on the three year backlog space.", "Rich Valera", "Brian, just quickly on the CapEx guidance. There still seems pretty elevated by historical standards is that still in relation to the new facility build out?", "Brian Beattie", "It is, Rich. If we you can think back at the beginning of 2014, we thought our CapEx profile would be about $135 million, and it came in just over $100 million. So again, as we try to optimize the actual cash disbursements to as late as we can allowed us to come in just over the $100 million mark. And then looking ahead to next year some of that related to our new leased facility, we\u2019ll just extend into 2015.", "So, the rest is normal. It\u2019s really only related to IT, related to giving us state-of-the-art capability and computing and networking, and then still some of the build that related to finishing off our new facility and also relative to some of the new acquisitions that we've completed so the rest of it is all related to facility side.", "I had forecast ahead that 16 of that number would come down at this point because our major leased new facility in Silicon Valley will be completed by then.", "Rich Valera", "How much it might come down the several 100 - not willing to go there at this point?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, I think, just for that facility, it's going to come down on $10s of millions just on that facility itself but what we\u2019re calling our 690 middlefield set up.", "", "Rich Valera", "Great. Thanks very much, gentlemen.", "Brian Beattie", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, number one, Aart, where do you think you have the share in emulation is today? And given the fact that, in the past you\u2019ve spoken about more of the softer wrapping being used by \u2013 using emulators. Have you seen any traction to the platform and where do you think it is today versus a year ago?", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah, we don't disclose the individual share of product. But, you're correct, to say that a lot of emphasis is going into the software dimension. In general terms with a number of three in the emulation market, but in the overall prototyping space I think we are in a strong leadership position, and we see that in some of the other product.", "And while we open the door of the software, of course verification is heading there but so is the Coverity move. And you can sort of see that as a natural adjacency to that whole space of verification.", "Krish Sankar", "That's very helpful. And for FinFET side, how would you characterize the progress? It seems like you guys have been qualified at pretty much all the major FinFET manufacturers. How would you characterize its progress compared to like maybe six or nine months ago given that they had some starting issues. Do you think most of those are behind us and the yield improvements are getting. Or do you still think there is a long road ahead.", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, and yes, meaning that, I think the progress has been excellent. I think that in general people will say, well you know there have been quite a number of challenges to overcoming yield, which actually is not a surprise at all, this is very sophisticated technology.", "But the adoption rate and the number of new designs I think is well on track to rival the previous major generations. And so, Synopsys specifically, we are very much on top of this because we\u2019re engaged very early to the tea CAD, the three dimensional modeling as the transitters are literally being invented.", "And then all the - in between steps of being ready with the tools, we\u2019re there, designs are being done and the majority actually is our tools.", "And then of course, the IP position is very important as well because for all the advanced chips, you can't design a chip today unless you use major IP box, and those have to be highly tuned for the advance technologies. And Synopsys is absolutely leader in that area as well.", "So, I would characterize it as moving forward well. I think it will be a number of companies or customers that will hold on at 28 nanometer until they see the other side of the bridge so to speak, that FinFET\u2019s are really stable and then they will move as well but all the advanced guys are already there.", "Krish Sankar", "Thanks. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sterling Auty", "Thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to start with \u2013 how would you characterize employment growth or headcount growth in design engineers and its impact on your growth that you saw in 2014? And what do you think that looks like for 2015?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "That's very difficult to characterize because there\u2019s not much in terms of hard numbers there, but I would say, that in general it feels very stable to me with the exception of the Far East where the headcount is still substantially growing. And one can also see that a little bit watching how customers battle for key employees and how some of the salaries are moving up.", "So, fundamentally I think it's a positive message, there is some geographies as you would expect, such as Japan and Europe, that are lagging, I think the U.S. is in very stable, maybe even strong position and the Far East is going.", "Sterling Auty", "And how would you characterize - we did a number of questions about the moves that China is making to become a bigger and bigger player in the semiconductor industry. How that might help your business in the coming year or more?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for us that is not a surprise at all because we have been very active since literally the middle 90s and strange to say, but that's almost 20 years ago now. And in the process, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous evolution in terms of the gradual competence to now superb competence in semiconductor design and system design.", "And in the last few years one can literally see how the adoption of the most advanced silicon technologies has progressed more rapidly in China than other places. It is all not a surprise, this is obviously a country that is rapidly becoming one of these very large economies, and modern economies are big users and developers of advanced technology. Electronics is absolutely at the vortex of all of that.", "Sterling Auty", "And then Brian, just two quick ones for you. Talking about the 80% of this year\u2019s guidance revenue already on the balance sheet, if I do that calculation and say okay what percentage, what does that mean in terms of percentage of the backlog that it actually would come through the income statement this year? It\u2019s actually a smaller percentage than what we saw last year. Is there any mechanics to that or is this too nuanced?", "Brian Beattie", "No. I would highlight if we want to compare it to this time a year ago, we indicated we had more than 75% of the year's revenues in hand for 2014. And this year we're back to 80% level of the coverage, and again, we base guidance based on what we have in hand and how we can actually convert that through.", "So, it's a more traditional profile than what we had just in 2014. And again the high levels of confidence obviously in delivering that much. And so you can look at $3.5 billion backlog, you know that relative to our revenue guidance that we just provided, we have 80% of that in hand, that's the amount that comes out of that year-end $3.5 billion backlog.", "Sterling Auty", "And last question on the cash flow so, the [75] [ph] million of one time, you mentioned the higher cash taxes but if we would believe that bookings would hopefully knock on wood grow why wouldn't cash flow at least be flat year-over-year? What's the other elements or moving parts that perhaps could cause us to a down year in cash flow?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, again, we look - the number one thing we look at very specific collection profiles by customers just as you mentioned we have 80% of the year, we also have a significant amount of collections scheduled with a very high probabilities of collecting that.", "The additional amount comes from new bookings which again we tie in very closely with our sales team on the projected profile of that, and then of course disbursements are something we control.", "So, every year we look at specific forecast based on that and that produces our approximately $450 million, and in the long run our operating cash flow really tracks extremely close to our EBITDA line.", "And when you look at where we ended up in 2014, was significantly over what we had forecast again our trading line with that EBITDA and the fact we did nicely and overachieved on the timing of those renewals and good cash management and good disbursed management.", "Sterling Auty", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "", "Tom Diffely", "So Brian, there was just about a time if we \u2013 but congratulations on the promotion.", "", "Brian Beattie", "Well, thanks Tom, I\u2019m really looking forward to it.", "Tom Diffely", "So, maybe I'll take this chance to ask you few question and any impact you\u2019ve seen from the Euro, Yen in the current quarter and what you think maybe an impact in that year?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, again when we factor all of this into our guidance range, and we did see an impact - slight impact in terms of revenue in 2014, but again based on our really solid hedging program and the fact we do of course have expenses in Japan too, it had really a non-material impact on the total year.", "As I look ahead to 2015, I see about 1% headwind on the Yen, just checking this morning, we\u2019re almost at 1.20 and it continues to weaken of course in Japan with a lot of forecast going forward.", "We\u2019re very fortunate that we\u2019ve hedged about 60% of our revenues at a rate of about 102 for next year, and so we feel again comfortable we\u2019ve got it but you\u2019re only able to really hedge about 60% of revenue.", "So, all-in-all it's our typical management program, that\u2019s how we manage and it give us really, really good predictability. And if you did look at our Japanese performance on the year-over-year basis, all of that dealt is just due to the Yen itself.", "So, I think again the company is performing nicely in Japan but unfortunately we do all we can to offset that impact of the Yen and we're well setup for 2015, on that.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And just as a reminder, do you hedge four quarters out in both Euro and Yen?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, we do on - remember, just our only currency we hedge for revenues is the Yen, everything else is U.S. dollar based and with our spending profile in Europe with declining Euro, we also hedge basically everything a year in advance, one quarter at a time, it\u2019s a revolving hedging program that we constantly have in place.", "It's not that we can predict better but we can give better visibility and know what the actual result we\u2019re going to get solidly locked in for a year in advance.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. Great. And then when I look at the GAAP projections \u2013 the guidance for that year, the first quarter has impacted while the restructuring but it looks like the lesser year is lower as well, so I'm curious what the difference is there? Is there a tax rate or more expenses you expect?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, the GAAP tax - the GAAP earnings per share forecast for 2015 is lower, all really related to taxation, and when we look at how we optimize for our global transfer pricing, we look at a number of acquisitions that we put in place so we make sure that our IP is allocated to those right locations.", "So, GAAP basis, we will see some higher taxes related to those acquisitions. On a non-GAAP basis we\u2019re forecasting a rate of about 22% for the full year which is right back to kind of the normal standards for us.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. Can you build on the GAAP tax rate at this point \u2013 single numbers that too variable for the year?", "Brian Beattie", "Yeah, it's up from our management rates, but I don\u2019t have that in front of me.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then Aart, when you look at the emulation business, the Zebu, does the new Zebu came out this, does that reflect kind of the synergies you would expect to get from working with the Synoposis team or is that just kind of the last generation of the prior development team?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, yes and no. It does reflected because obviously this has been an enormous amount of work to get this machine to this state and get it ready for release, and that is under Synopsys, leadership of course.", "The no part is that we have another much larger project which is the integration and the verification continuum. Given that, this is an extremely fast machine but it's compilation times, not as competitive as we want them to be.", "And so part of the integration we are working on improving that substantially. And in FY2015, you will definitely hear about progress.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then finally in your prepared remarks you talked about IP subsystems. Are those shipping to date as more of the future projects we take individual components and bundle them together?", "Aart de Geus", "We're shipping today, and the notion of subsystem is interesting because we have them in audio and in the sensor part. Subsystems are not just couple of building blocks but there also many, many rules that you have to follow in order to connect these building blocks correctly, the embedded software, some of the verification capabilities.", "And so what we\u2019re aiming at here is to really optimize the entire process of integrating these blocks into much larger SOC systems on the chip. And I think the desire from customers is quite high to get help from us in that.", "As much as I am the lover of calling all these building blocks, Lego blocks because it conveys exactly how you can assemble things. The reality is little bit more complex than Lego blocks to connect and so the more we can automate that better.", "Tom Diffely", "Do you think the innovative things type chips going forward are going to be the biggest user of this subsystems?", "", "Aart de Geus", "Not necessarily. I think the very large chips that are being built today are all available on the premise of substantial amount of IP reuse and the IP can come from - can be at many different level, very low levels such as gates and memories but highly sophisticated level such as entire memory subsystems for example.", "And I think in the situation of Internet-of-Things, yes there will be certain subsystems that will be of particularly high interest. This is still a very early field in terms of scoping what will be all the possibilities, what is in no doubt though is that it will be a massive number of things that are interconnected.", "And those things will gradually need more and more smarts and our objective is to be part of providing those embedded mark.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Brian let me start with you, let me forward you change business cards. Let me ask a couple of financial questions. First in terms of margin expansion outlook for fiscal 2015, could you talk about the contribution of any additional margin scaling in the IP business or from the IP business?", "Secondly in terms of cash flow for the year, you had a more than $100 million negative swing in accounts receivable. On the other hand you had $100 million positive swing for differed revenue. So it looks like the bulk of both of those changes took place in Q4 and therefore commence with it unusual large increase in bookings and backlog last quarter?", "", "Brian Beattie", "Okay, Jay. Let me answer those two questions.", "First on the IP margin impact. So you stated that right. We\u2019re targeting at about 100 basis point improvement in operating margin in 2015 over 2014. And really, IP is \u2013 again still on track for what we\u2019ve indicated as those multi-year goals, low double digit growth and those are the type of things we\u2019re building on and that of course will contribute to margin dollars of income and some margin improvements coming from that side as well. So, a lot of success with IP and lot of momentum going into 2015.", "Over on the cash flow number itself, yes it did come in. We hit the record level of operating cash flow for 2014, and a lot of it is timing on a very strong fourth quarter. Right, we had already well over throughout 2014 we got the fourth quarter and did really well with the timing of the renewals coming in, with some good run rates on them and so seeing it up really nicely for cash collections.", "And then when you start looking at details like receivables are up, that\u2019s about the strong level of business that came in, when you look at payables and other accrued liabilities that\u2019s taking into account a number of expenses that are already booked and have purchased some of the variable compensation.", "So again, we\u2019ve given some good details relative to that cash flow guidance. And things like deferred revenue, as you know for us that\u2019s just timing and not a great metric for indicating ongoing performance that moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on timing of when we can invoice customers.", "So lot of information there, does that answer your questions?", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "", "Yeah. Thank you. Actually one more for you. With respect to your largest customer you\u2019ve almost always described it as being over 10% of revenue to one degree or another. You didn\u2019t say that explicitly this time, so perhaps just to fine tune that you didn\u2019t quite get over 10% from your largest customer in the most recent quarter?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "We did.", "Brian Beattie", "", "We\u2019re just over the 10% mark.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Aart, when you look at the last one to two years in terms of the evolution of your customer base, perhaps you could talk about how the proportion of contribution from the semiconductor companies, the AMDs and TIs of the world may have changed for you and how at the same time the so-called systems customers may have evolved for you proportionately and how are your guidance for the next year or so things about any additional evolution in that sort of customer mix?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, really to answer this question, well one should go back already multiple years because it is multiple years ago that the system companies or at least some of them decided to invest more in their own semiconductor based design for a couple of reasons. One, because they really wanted to drive performance and power down more than what their suppliers are offering them.", "And two, because they wanted to be much more on top of optimizing the overall system and negotiating directly with the manufacturers given the high quantities they were after.", "And so for us we have now for quite a while over 40% of our business from so called system companies. And just to clarify, there are system companies that do system design, there are system companies that do system design and semiconductor design, and there are some companies that do those two and manufacturing.", "And so sometimes the terminology is little bit confused but at the end of the day the most important customers are the ones that do the most sophisticated and the largest volume business and that has not changed for us in a number of years but it has evolved over the last decade.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then maybe just to wrap up with you Aart, think about the contribution of IC Compiler 2 for fiscal 2015 with somewhat following up on Rich\u2019s earlier question, what has been the reception so far to the note based pricing that you\u2019ve introduced with IC Compiler? And to what extent do you expect incremental payment or revenue from the more advanced capabilities as compared with merely propagating it via maintenance but not necessarily for more money?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well, I think you heard Brian say earlier that certainly in Q4 we had a number of renewals with good growth and as a matter of fact the run rate for the company is up. Again, and that is how successful products mostly manifest themselves because for all the large customers they have of course many products and when there is a product that\u2019s particularly attractive such as IC Compiler 2, they want to quickly have the opportunity to add that to their contract to upgrade and invariably that\u2019s an opportunity to reup the contract for the next three years and the run rates go up.", "So, so far only positive impact and I expect that to continue because the adoption rate is as said very high and for the people that have now not only taped out but gotten silicon back, they have been remarkably positive on the impact it had on their time to market.", "And so at the limit that\u2019s converting technology advances into true value for the customer.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Sir, we are at the five minutes marked. Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Hi, this is Shawn [ph] for Mahesh, thanks for taking my questions. Aart, I think in your prepared remark you had said about 80% [indiscernible] verification tools. I am just wondering can you comment on your market position in each component within verification, say, software, hardware, and verification IP?", "", "Aart de Geus", "I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite understand the second phrase of your question. In what type of components?", "Unidentified Analyst", "I mean in the software part, hardware part, as well as verification IP.", "Aart de Geus", "In the verification area. Well, the verification area is one under very rapid evolution because the stall word tool, is simulation, has been simulation, and will remain simulation for a long period of time. And the reason for that is because if you don\u2019t verify the fundamental larger behavior of chips, all the other sort of Moot point.", "At the same time there's no question that if one can accelerate simulation, the emulation techniques or FPGaxe techniques that is highly desirable, and that is especially desirable as the software content increases because not a surprise more and more companies are discovering that the software is actually less reliable as a design process than the hardware which has been incredibly automated.", "And so from our perspective this is all good news because we have invested in a continuum that moves from the hardware stimulation to the software verification and as you know on top of that we are now also investing in the whole process of how to develop code in the first place that is higher quality and also more imperious to security issues.", "So in many way this is sort of a Morphing of our own value proposition from absolutely a set of state-of-the-art advanced tools to now the next generation platform and I think much of the positive revenues we get from customers is on the basis of that change and its absolutely driven by the people that are at the most advance edges of technology.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. And as a follow up, I remember last quarter you said that for verification compiling [indiscernible] pipeline is higher than expected. I am just wondering, can you provide an update in that area, how does the pipeline looks like now versus three month ago?", "Aart de Geus", "", "Yes. Let me first remind people what verification compiler is, it is a product that contains many of the what we now call sub-products but it has for example the software simulator and the debugger and the IP and some of the more advanced static checkers.", "And so that product itself has actually seen good momentum and we have seen a number of sales on that basis already. To be honest, I don\u2019t know where the pipeline is right now. My focus has been very much on the overall continuum that sees a lot of momentum but verification compiler is very good solution for people that use all of these tools together.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thanks, Aart.", "Operator", "", "And the next question is from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Monika Garg", "Looking at fiscal 2014, total revenue growth organically, my estimation was just about 3.6%, right. But the IP is expected to grow low double digit and your core EDA low to mid single digit. So maybe you could help us understand why the growth was low last year?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "Well mostly it is due to lower growth rate in IP because a lot of its business was either pushed out or had deliverables that sell into 2015. And you may recall that during the year we commented on that saying that our own assessment was that the IP business was growing at low double digits on a multi year basis and all the evidence based on what we know today about FY15 supports that to far.", "So definitely in 2015 you will see a much higher components due to the IP growth.", "Monika Garg", "The indication in Coverity, your last investor webcast you talked about Coverity growing north of 20%. Is that still the fair assumption for 2015 and 2016 for the growth rate of Coverity?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "That is the ballpark that we are aiming at. Of course this is all complicated a little bit by this notion of haircuts. But in general that is the objective that we\u2019re shooting for and that is the premise against which we are predicting that that present business would be over $100 million in 2016 and profitable.", "Monika Garg", "", "And was there any revenue kind of recognition impact even in fiscal 2016 for Coverity?", "", "Aart de Geus", "", "You mean is there any hair cut left for 2015, I think minimally so. There\u2019s a little bit smaller.", "Monika Garg", "", "Okay. Got it.", "Brian Beattie", "Remember, it's $15 million in 2015. So we have to take that into account. That\u2019s built in our guidance, and then by 2016, there\u2019s just a little bit left.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks. Then the question is if you look at, you have raised strong cash balance more then close to $1 billion, more than 900 million net cash. Why not accelerate share buyback to reduce your outstanding share account?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, that is always a valid question. We prioritize the utilization of our cash in terms of M&A, making sure that when we have debt obligations, we live up to those and then of course, buyback. Just like you are suggesting, one of the things to not forget is that the balance of the cash between domestic and international is fairly massively. So, that tends to bring a bit of a practical limiter unless one uses other mechanisms.", "But you may have heard that, Brian, suggested that this year we want to pay much higher degree of attention on keeping the share count flat. And so we will certainly do a buyback.", "Brian Beattie", "And Monika, just to clarify the numbers, we were significant buyback in 2014, to keep the share count very close to the 2013 levels, and then again committing for 2015 to hold it there. So you\u2019d see through 2013, 2014, and 2015, roughly a fair share count through all three years.", "So, again it\u2019s putting our money to work, doing the appropriate level of buyback while as I mentioned leaving enough for strategic M&A opportunities in front of us.", "Monika Garg", "The last one here from me Aart. We all have seen design complexity growing which is thus really benefiting via companies. Do you think is it possible that we could see higher operating margins right, R&D expenses very high for industry. So do you think [indiscernible]?", "Aart de Geus", "We are at the heart of the heart of high-tech of the world, and so R&D expenses will stay a key component to be successful to bring this about. At the same time, we reiterated that our objective is to continue to move towards a solid mid-20s operating margin. And I think, Brian gave you the initial guidance for where we would land in 2015.", "So that general direction has not changed. Obviously it\u2019s a function of how competitive do you want to be in the different areas. And also what opportunities do we see in some of the new areas, specifically IP which has a relatively fast turn around on investments turning to revenue, and then still very open ended and promising area of software verification. And we certainly have good ambitions.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all from me.", "Operator", "And there is no one else in queue. Please continue with any closing remarks.", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, almost perfect timing here. Thank you so much for attending this earnings release. Thank you also for all your support during FY14. We don\u2019t spend much time looking back or looking forward, and as we look forward we see a company that has three main businesses that we will continue to optimize totally for. And we\u2019re entering 2015 with a good degree of momentum.", "We look forward to speak to you after this call for some of the analysts and otherwise at the next earnings release. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay today after 4 p.m. Pacific Time through December 17 at midnight.

Davidson", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities", "Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com.", "In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. We delivered revenue of $542 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80. We entered into a $180 million accelerated share buyback program to repurchase stock. We are on-track to meeting our operating cash flow goal of approximately $450 million for the year. We are raising our revenue target to $2.195 billion to $2.235 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS objective to a range of $2.75 to $2.80, the midpoint of which represents double-digit growth. Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly.", "Looking at the economic landscape around us, I would characterize both the macro and semiconductor environments as solid. The overall economic outlook remains stable, with levels of caution that vary by geography.", "For semiconductors, which had a strong 2014 with about 10% growth, the outlook for 2015 is positive, albeit with the usual early year trepidations driven by a very competitive market.", "The impact of semiconductors continues to grow, not only in the traditional computation and mobile communication areas, but increasingly in every aspect of our daily life, including health, automotive, and financial segments. With this unstoppable evolution of the electronics market, the relentless drive for smaller and lower-power transistors continues unabated.", "Its corollary, much more complex chips that integrate complete systems, including rapidly mounting embedded software content, continues to drive our and our customers' business.", "The number of designs using power-efficient FinFET transistors at sizes as small as 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, and 10 nanometer is growing at a fast pace. At the same time, the cost and time-to-market pressures can make or break a product cycle. For our customers, this puts great emphasis on partnering with vendors who can not only provide the best tools, but who also collaborate intensely to ensure product success.", "Synopsys is uniquely positioned to be just that partner, and in fact has demonstrated time and again our value as an integral part of their success.", "One such partner, one of the most important wireless IC companies in the world, expanded its relationship with us in Q1. As they develop their next-generation of products and plan their requirements for the next several years, they'll count on close collaboration and the leverage of a larger portfolio of Synopsys tools across digital and analog/mixed signal, design, and verification.", "In 2014, we launched a multi-year Silicon to Software market strategy, predicated on three pillars. First, build on our leadership in EDA with the clear objective to provide the state-of-the-art toolset required to design the next generations of chips. Second, grow our IP offering as one of the highest-impact productivity mechanisms available to design highly complex chips under unrelenting time-to-market constraints. And third, invest in and grow our Software Quality and Security solutions, as embedded software expands massively into next-generation electronic systems, and the vulnerabilities of application software create more and more challenges in our day-to-day lives.", "We enter Q2 with confidence in our business due to our position and expertise ranging from deep silicon to sophisticated software; our comprehensive product portfolio utilized today by the most influential semi and systems companies; a global technical support team widely recognized as the best in the world; and a predictable business model that enables us to invest consistently to advance technology, while simultaneously driving long-term shareholder value.", "Let me now provide some highlights for the past quarter, starting with EDA. As the acknowledged technology leader at advanced nodes, Synopsys is deeply engaged in our customers' efforts, ranging from early process development, to chip design, to system verification. The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date grew nearly 15% in just the last quarter, to almost 200. The breadth of our FinFET proven tools and IP gives us a notable competitive advantage, as evidenced by Synopsys being relied on for approximately 95% of these designs. At the very bleeding edge, we're engaged in numerous 10 nanometer partnerships with early adopters, and we're the go-to partner for 10 nanometer process development.", "Through our TCAD technology, we're already collaborating with silicon providers and research consortia such as IMEC on 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer. As a result of these early-stage collaborations, we have access to key models much earlier in the process than our competitors, giving us a sustainable advantage.", "Our relentless innovation in verification, both digital and analog/mixed-signal, is evident as well. Our flagship VCS functional verification product is the primary simulator for 80% of advanced designs.", "In 2014, we began rolling out game-changing new products that are driving a multi-year upgrade cycle in both design and verification. The single most important EDA tool launch in the last decade was IC Compiler II. Announced last March, and which delivers, we claimed at that time, an astonishing 10X improvement in throughput. Now with more than 50 engagements, our productivity claims are being confirmed again and again, and we're now systematically helping customers proliferate IC Compiler II into their production flows.", "During the quarter, Renesas stated in a press release that they, \"view ICC II as a key enabler of competitive differentiation, and are in the process of extending its application to all key in-flight programs across 40 nanometer to 28 nanometer and below.\" Another advanced customer commented that, while the speed-up itself is impressive, the impact when combined with its larger capacity is that it opens the door to fundamentally changing the very way in which design is done. That is why we refer to it as a game changer in the industry.", "At this point, IC Complier II has already delivered a rapidly growing number of successful tape-outs, and we see high demand across our customer base.", "In verification, our objectives are just as ambitious. We're executing on a Verification Continuum vision that integrates best-in-class hardware and software engines aimed at radically impacting verification and debugging productivity.", "In 2014, we released the first set of capabilities in our Verification Compiler product, which combines all our software-based verification tools. Demand and initial adoption have been excellent. We're now broadening our integration to encompass both software and hardware-based verification engines. As we're fortunate to have both the fastest engines and the number one position in a majority of the verification areas, tight integration will drive substantial productivity increases for our customers.", "This has enormous value to them as they struggle with chip and system complexities compounded by hardware-software interactions. The early results are truly excellent and throughout 2015, we'll roll out key capabilities that position us well over the next several years.", "Our strong ecosystem partnerships with the leading foundries and key IP providers are also critical in supporting our mutual customers. For example, last month, ARM and Synopsys announced support for ARM's new Cortex-A72 processor for mobile SoC development. The reference flow includes a range of Synopsys tools, including our powerful IC Compiler II product.", "Let me move to our second strategic priority of growing our IP and Prototyping product lines. Demand for IP is strong, as more and more companies outsource standards-based, yet complex, IP blocks. Synopsys is the number one supplier of interface, analog, memory, and physical semiconductor IP, bolstered by a reputation for highest quality, reliability, and technical excellence.", "We are increasingly at the forefront of process viability as our IP is a vital enabler of the commercial introduction of new technology nodes, be it the most advanced FinFET processes or those targeting the Internet of Things.", "We've taped out more than 30 FinFET chips, and the silicon results look very good across the board. We secured a large, strategic win for a broad set of 10 nanometer IP blocks, and also delivered our first 10 nanometer embedded memory IP, all indicative of our momentum.", "In addition, we are the very first IP provider of a USB 3.1 controller. This new generation of USB has great promise; it's twice as fast as USB 3.0, and more power efficient. Imagine the impact of such improvements in your daily use of your mobile devices.", "As you know, the software content on those mobile devices is huge and growing. The design challenges are significant, and it's become necessary to adopt an approach that enables software development to occur at the same time as the chip design, thereby speeding time-to-market by six to nine months.", "Our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping solution does just that, and has proven itself in the marketplace. Q1 was its highest revenue quarter ever, and with more than 5,000 HAPS systems installed at customers today, we have excellent momentum.", "Turning now to Strategic Priority number three, expand our presence in software quality and security by building on the excellent Coverity Solutions we acquired last year. In this new market space that analysts expect to grow in the 20% range, we see our opportunity in three primary areas. One, accelerate adoption in the directly adjacent embedded software market segment, which covers software embedded on a chip, or electronic system. Two, accelerate adoption in the largely untapped enterprise-applications market segment that reaches industries from financial to health, energy, retail, social media, et cetera. And three, enlarge the portfolio by investing in new languages, and further expanding in the security space.", "The Coverity integration of infrastructure and sales has gone well, and our initial financial expectations are on track. We saw 32 new logos in the quarter, and executed an important agreement with a large, U.S. energy company, which expanded its usage after good initial success. This customer values not only the excellent technology, but also the stability and resources of the larger Synopsys entity.", "In summary, we are confident and optimistic about our business. We delivered strong results in Q1, and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. We see high demand for our compelling new technologies in core EDA, which will drive a multi-year upgrade cycle. Our ever-expanding portfolio of IP and momentum in FPGA prototyping are driving strong IP and systems growth.", "And finally, we're making good progress in our new, higher-growth software quality and security space.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Building on a strong foundation in 2014, we're starting this year with great momentum. Our excellent Q1 financial results and improved 2015 outlook leaves us increasingly confident in our ability to execute our strategy for growth and profitability. In Q1, we met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets we provided in December, posted double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings, and accelerated our stock buyback program.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q1 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 13% to $542 million. Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.4 years, but we expect the full year duration to be approximately 3 years.", "Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were $471 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $403 million, below our target range, due largely to a shift in timing of expenses, including some delayed hiring, as well as lower travel and professional services. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 25.7%.", "GAAP earnings per share were $0.41. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, above our target range due largely to a lower tax rate and timing of expenses.", "Non-GAAP tax rate was 13.4%, due mostly to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2014. The Q1 tax rate includes both a retroactive benefit for fiscal 2014 and a partial year impact to fiscal 2015. As a result, we think a non-GAAP tax rate between 19% and 20% is a reasonable estimate for 2015.", "Turning to cash flow. As expected, Q1 had a net operating cash outflow. The $87 million outflow was due mostly to the timing of 2014 incentive compensation payments, along with one-time severance payments related to our voluntary retirement program and other restructuring. We continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $450 million.", "We ended the quarter with total debt of $303 million. This includes $235 million from our revolver, drawn during the quarter to largely fund our Q1 share repurchases, and $68 million from our term loan.", "During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or ASR, for $180 million. This was part of our goal to keep share count roughly flat with 2014 levels. Under this ASR, we received 3.3 million shares in Q1, and expect to receive the balance by Q3 when the ASR is completed. We have $200 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of $917 million, with 13% onshore. We'll continue to optimize the use of cash to generate maximum long-term shareholder value. Each quarter we will evaluate our M&A, buyback, and debt reduction options, to determine the best balance.", "DSO was 49 days and we ended Q1 with approximately 9,300 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies.", "Now to our second quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the second quarter, our targets are revenue between $543 million and $553 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $470 million and $489 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $418 million and $428 million; other income between $0 million and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 22% to 23%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.33 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.62 to $0.64 per share.", "For fiscal 2015, we are increasing our revenue target to $2.195 billion to $2.235 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 9%; we expect other income between $5 million and $9 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $1.41 to $1.50 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $89 million in stock-based compensation expense; we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share, which represents double-digit growth at the mid-point; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.", "Finally, to help in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be slightly higher than first half revenue, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter. We expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly toward the second half of the year, with non-GAAP EPS increasing sequentially from Q2 to Q4.", "In summary, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent financial results, highlighted by double-digit top and bottom-line growth and solid operating margin. We are also increasing revenue and EPS guidance for the year, reflecting the confidence and optimism we have for the business.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "Your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Aart, I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment on the competitive dynamics in the EDA industry, particularly, I guess in digital, as you probably know your largest competitor is talking about gaining share in digital and has increased their expenses pretty significantly this year to support those share gains. So just wanted to get your sense if, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape and do you think you need to change your level of investment to address these changes to the degree you're seeing them? Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you. No, we don't see any big changes nothing that you're telling me is not age-old EDA, this has always been a very competitive landscape. And we are in the fortunate situation of specifically in the digital side, we have some really fabulous products that has been rolled out and that are now gradually being distributed to customers. So that brings with it that there is quite a bit of support effort to help them move on to the new project and so on. So we will be very, very busy from that perspective, this is an intense time, but it's an intense time with a very good outlook given the quality of the products that we have.", "Rich Valera", "I know you'd be willing to comment on share gains specifically but give the ICC II ramp that you're expecting, would you be willing to even qualitatively talk about your thoughts on share as you move out over the next couple of years, I mean your ability to at least maintain your share in digital with that ICC II ramp in front of you?", "Aart de Geus", "Well our objective is to clearly grow it. At the same time, we're enough to know that for many years I've said that EDA is the industry where all the children are always above average, and all the share gains are above average. And so yes, there are many claims always being made. At the end of the day it is what are the results over long period of time.", "The second thing is many of the contracts that we have of course are very complex and very large. And so these things change gradually, but there is no question that with the strong technology we have an excellent shot at moving forward step-by-step and so far it looks like that's working out fine.", "Rich Valera", "Great. And just one product question if I could on Verification Compiler, you alluded to some enhancements you're expecting to incorporate into that in this year. Any color you're willing to give us in advance of those actually being announced?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, just to clarify, so Verification Compiler was actually a product we introduced last year.", "Rich Valera", "Right.", "Aart de Geus", "And it was the integration of all the software verification tools and the benefit of having that integration was immediately higher productivity for the customer. But also the possibility for designers to quickly move from one type of product needed to another in that context.", "Our longer-term and much broader ambition has been to establish a Verification Continuum that reaches much broader space, including the various forms of hardware verification tools and even something beyond that. And so that is been the focus at least for our R&D teams for the last year. There is the results that I've seen are truly outstanding and during the year we will gradually announce those as we're ready to make them available to customers.", "Rich Valera", "Great. And I'm sorry one more, because I just thought of that, you mentioned HAPS, I think had a strongest quarter in history I believe --", "Aart de Geus", "Yes.", "Rich Valera", "It's history since you've had it at least. What do you attribute that to? Is there something secular going on there or is it, what are your thoughts on the kind of prototyping market and how that looks going forward?", "Aart de Geus", "The answer is actually very simple. You remember you would certainly know 10 years ago, there was this term that was new system on a chip --", "Rich Valera", "Sure.", "Aart de Geus", "We're completely there. System on a chip means it's a hardware piece with a bulk load of software. And the challenge with that is of course that the software guys would like to start modeling and trying out their software before the chips are ready.", "And so be it individual chips or in some cases even broader systems off chips, those are being modeled on the HAPS boards, and the benefit of the HAPS boards is that they are amazingly fast in run time, and that is absolutely key if you want to drive some software where the speed is relevant in terms of testing it. And so that is the simple reason why we see that and I think that will continue.", "Rich Valera", "That's great. Thanks Aart, I appreciate it.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome, Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes, thanks. Hi, guys, wanted to start with the upfront revenue, when you guided for the quarter, had you contemplated this level of upfront revenue as part of the mix and what was the driver?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, Sterling, this is Trac. The revenue came in as expected in total as well as the various line items. Certainly the upfront revenues were strong and that was due to a strong hardware quarter primarily the HAPS side.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And how should we think about the mix of upfront? Because on a percentage basis this is the highest percent in recent memory, is it going to continue at this level or fluctuate?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, upfronts will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I think upfronts will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Our model for upfronts remains at 10% or less.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then turning to sales and marketing, you mentioned the shift in spending and hiring, can you give us a sense of how many heads you were anticipating hiring in the quarter that may have shifted to the second quarter?", "Trac Pham", "You can see that the headcount did decrease from Q4 to Q1. A large portion of that was due to the voluntary retirement program and the small layoff we had, but also the delayed hiring.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. How would you characterize? Because one of the things is duration down to 2.4, sales and marketing down seasonally more than expected, and you're giving us some transparency. I want to make sure that we get a good handle. You're not going to give us the bookings number but these are the things that we kind of use to triangulate to whether it was a good bookings quarter or a challenging one and these items are kind of pointing to challenging in terms of the duration and expenses. Anything else you can give us in terms of transparency to the top two, how much of that were these items and versus the health of the bookings in the quarter?", "Trac Pham", "Well I would say that Q1 came in as we expected across our business segments, all of our business metrics. The run rate was up, the duration was light at 2.4 for the quarter, but we expected to trend back to three years for the full year, didn't see anything unusual in the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes, good afternoon. So may be first Trac, when you look at the $0.18 upside in the quarter, it looks like back of the envelope calculations here that $0.10, $0.12 came from lower costs and $0.06, $0.08 from lower taxes, does that sound about right?", "Trac Pham", "I would say it's more about half of that was taxes about $0.08.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And so the increase in the full-year guidance is largely due to the tax?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, so when you look at, I'm sorry. When you look at Q1 there is really three things happening revenues came in as expected, the upside was really on lower tax rate; two, higher than expected other income; and then, three, the shifting of expenses. And as I said $0.08 of that is roughly the tax rate.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And what is your current view of the FX impact during the quarter and what you project might be a headwind or tailwind going forward?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, I mean that's a really good question considering the variability and FX this year. Let me just step back and say that we do have a hedging program in place to protect our financials both the P&L and the balance sheet from that volatility. From a P&L perspective, our goal is to protect the annual EPS from any FX movements.", "On the revenue line, our revenues are invoiced in dollars except for Japan, which last year was roughly 12%, we do hedge that revenue. On expenses, we got about a third in local currency and that's hedged as well. So what you see on a net-net basis is that FX had an immaterial impact on our bottom-line year-over-year.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then Aart, when you look at the IP market, how do you view the market when we move from the plainer world to maybe 40 nanometer FinFET and then ultimately 10 nanometer FinFET. Does the IP market itself increase dramatically from those steps?", "Aart de Geus", "For us it will. And the reason is that what that means is that building the IP is actually substantially more difficult. So much so that's a number of people that are introducing a new technology can only do that if simultaneously to a number of other things, a substantial amount of IP is ready to go, otherwise people can't design chips. And given that, for that we're now extremely well versed and literally the smallest sizes of FinFET technology, especially in our IP team, I think we're well positioned to become more and more of a backbone provider to the industry.", "It's also one of the reasons why we collaborate very closely with the foundries and other technology providers, because if we work with them ahead of time we can sort of see where the technology is going, what the problems are going to be, and invariably even when the technology is introduced it goes through quite a number of iterations and lot of refinements and improvements for yield and our team is all over that.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay, that's nice. And then finally when you look at the 50 plus engagements with IC Compiler II, at this point can you tell what impact of this new product that's 10 times faster has on the market size, is it shrinking the market because it's so much faster or is it actually potentially growing the market because it can do a lot more or enable a lot more?", "Aart de Geus", "The -- its always amazing, even at 10 times faster too it will not shrink the market for very simple reason which is, the first thing that customers do is, well I can do bigger things now, and I can do them sooner, and I can be more competitive. And so it's a little bit like introducing the next race car on the market immediately the races become even more intense and that is what IC Compiler does right now.", "Secondly, one should not underestimate how much chip complexity has grown in just the last four, five years. And you may recall that number of years ago I was very bullish on the impact of FinFET going forward at the time where it was not quite clear that the technology would make it. It is very clear that it's making it now and it's also very clear that the combination of lower power smaller devices will have impact on many chips.", "Initially it's all on the more complex chips; gradually it will become necessary even for the things that will end up in Internet of Things type product, so a lot of opportunity there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thanks, good evening. Aart, question for you first on IC Compiler II. To the extent that is sees good uptake, which you say you are in fact seeing, could there be as well a pull-through effect on other Synopsis tools whether or not they've been as architecturally overhauled as the implementation product has been, I'm thinking for instance, specifically of Design Compiler, PrimeTime, perhaps some others. So we've seen sometimes the areas of technology that one product does well it starts to pull other products in the company's portfolio along as well. So are you seeing something like that at all?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we're in a fortunate situation that in many of the situations our customers do already have the products that you mentioned. And there is no doubts that after many years of work, we have architected our tools in such a fashion that if you use them in combination, you will get better results, than if you sort of use the smorgasbord of independent tool and so from that perspective alone that's been a positive.", "Secondly, there is question that some tools tend to be more anchor point product. And so when renewal of contracts happen, it tends to bring up the question well what else should negotiated at that time, can we grow the contract, or can we become a broader provider and the answer is more often than not, yes. So all in all this is a good position to be in, having said that, there is competition and we have to battle for every opportunity and that is what customer needs in order to get the best tools.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "On the call a quarter ago you announced of course the management change involving Trac and self, and Brian, could you remind us of the internal changes you've made to align yourselves towards the changes in the customer base, the systems companies, and how that mix is evolving for you new vertical markets you're addressing this is not a Coverity specific question per se, but clearly you've to do things differently or align things differently inside the company, so could you remind us what you've done organizationally to prepare for an evolving end market?", "Aart de Geus", "Well the end market that has gradually become bit more systems dominated is not a new phenomenon. I think about 40% of our revenue comes from systems companies, the rest come from chip companies. And so we've been there for a long time.", "Your question is interesting nonetheless because more and more we're seeing that the software content that plays into many of chips or the systems becomes actually the differentiator for our customers, and sometimes it's also the negative differentiator meaning when it doesn't work away when it's not ready. And so from that perspective, I think we will see a gradual increase on first the verification tools around the whole hardware software. And obviously the acquisition of Coverity was to then open up new horizon towards the software period and they are there still a lot of open space.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "And one more product question for you and then last financial question for Trac. Rich and Sterling asked earlier about the HAPS business, my question there is, is there an analogy here at all in terms of the evolution of the market as we saw with emulation. So as you know of course that market was around for a long time, but wasn't very large, didn't really do very much until just the last few years and now we've seen it grow to fairly sustainable size and on the whole it's had pretty good growth, not every vendor every year, necessarily. Is there any reason to believe that the much smaller prototyping business could now be seen perhaps some similar kind of inflection for similar reasons over the next number of years?", "Aart de Geus", "I think in general your thinking is correct. I find it's relatively difficult to predict what the speed of that will be. And the reason I'm saying that is the difference between HAPS boards and emulators is that the HAPS boards, now they do look a little bit like a science project, I mean you've to pluck in a lot of wires and there's lot of mechanism to actually get the software into the chips just the right way. And now of course the people that do this are hyper sophisticated doing it. And I think the utilization will increase. How quickly it will go a little hard to tell but there's no question that the problem that is addressing is absolutely growing.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay. And then lastly for Trac, could you elaborate on why you would not have raised the cash flow guidance for the year on the higher GAAP net income outlook for the year. And more broadly when you look at over the next number of years and operating cash flow, free cash flow, besides net income and deferred revenue, what other principal levers do you foresee in terms of being able to meaningfully inflect or grow your working capital and overall cash flow?", "Trac Pham", "Okay. So I think I'll start with the first one, which is our cash flow guidance, Jay understood that. So we are confirming our cash flow guidance of $450 million. If I understand your question you raised revenue and EPS and why does cash flow stay the same?", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Yes.", "Trac Pham", "Yes, so it's early in the year cash flow tends to be one of the more difficult parts of our business to predict. Keep in mind, last year, as you recall we end up overachieving on our guidance by $100 million just to highlight how variable that can be long-term though. We are definitely very comfortable with -- we're comfortable with our guidance of $450 million for the year and we're certainly comfortable with our long-term trend on cash flows.", "I think if you ask what's going to drive that over the long-term, it does track EBITDA less cash taxes over time. So we continue to drive top-line growth and drive operating margins to the mid-20s you will see our cash flows trend with that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I actually joined a little late so I apologize if it has been asked. Kind of curious you started from the digital side now that cadence seems to be stepping up on the gas putting some customer investments. Can you just frame the situation in digital and what you're doing to contract it; I've got a follow-up after that?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, we commented early about that. The digital area is very interesting for us because we have, as you know, introduced some very powerful products specifically IC Complier II. And so we're massively engaged with a large number of customers already in a) improving that the technology is as good as we said it would be, and so far, every piece of feedback has been absolutely in tune with what we predicted originally. And then helping them gradually design it in as they have many chips that are in-flight as we would say, and you -- when it is always very careful with introducing new products, and it takes some handholding.", "So that is what we're focusing on and we see that as an opportunity to grow our share and to really work with customers on a very close partnership basis for the coming years.", "Krish Sankar", "That's really helpful, Art. As a follow-up trying to figure out the status of the emulation product with Eve, and in the past you've said that one of the applications you'd been using your product was more of a software wrapping rather than a true emulation potential. Kind of curious when you look forward, do you feel that the product cycle lifetime for emulation needs to come down from the typical four to five year cadence or do you think your strategy right now you have is the right one still?", "Aart de Geus", "In our field anything that can bring down the product cycle is a good thing. It's always amazing to me that after literally 50 years in this year, of Moore's Law, this continues exponential increasing complexity is being met with new tools, new products, and this is in verification, it is in implementation and so on, and of course emulation or HAPS boards or some of the virtual prototyping are very central to this.", "The one new twist to all of this is that now on top of this well-understood Moore's Law, you get all this embedded software and that brings a degree of complexity that is going to be a very difficult to keep at high quality and to verify and to get ready.", "On the other hand, that's exactly the type of job that we love we've been chasing that type of increasing complexity for many, many years. So be it emulation, be it rapid prototyping, be it virtual prototyping, or other techniques, all of these always welcome yesterday, and our team is non-stop raising forward to improve them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first, where you -- you've now created your yearly guidance by as much as you did your Q1 EPS estimates and you just kind of walk us through that?", "Trac Pham", "Q1 was good quarter and we did increase our annual EPS guidance to a range of $2.75 million to $2.80 million. As I can remind you, the majority of the overachievement was due to expense timing and non-operational items that's the tax rate and higher other income.", "And we're trying to strike the right balance between the overachievement and investments in the business. Investments per our plan, we see a lot of opportunities in IP, software quality, and security, and even and in our new EDA solutions. So we want to make sure that we're balanced for it.", "And I think one thing also keep in mind as you look at the guidance that we just provided at the midpoint we'll continue to increase operating margins by about 100 basis points year-over-year.", "Monika Garg", "Okay. And then, Aart, you talked about semi industry grew like 10% last year, grew high-single-digit before that but the core EDA growth rate which you have talked about is still 3% or 4%. Do you think EDA growth at least starts to come closer to semi industry growth?", "Aart de Geus", "Well just to be clear semiconductor industry goes up and down rather violently. And if I look at my numbers, I would say that the average semiconductor growth rate is probably around 4.2% to 4.5% right now if you look at it from a multiyear perspective. So in that sense EDA actually is pretty close to the customers and not that all that different. Overall EDA over many years has out executed semiconductors, but when the semiconductors have a great year, they worry about the bad year, and when they have a bad year, they worry, and so it's an industry that is always raising forward.", "Monika Garg", "Okay. I have a question on Coverity, previously you talked about Coverity expected to be credit second half this year, that is still the target, and Coverity was going kind of 20% plus which you talked before, is that -- is it still the growth rate you're expecting and seeing for that business?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. So we're still on target for a breakeven in the second half. And the other thing we said is that we would be over $100 million in 2016 and so far things look good.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Okay. So one quick question on your product revenues, you talked about system revenue as record, and do you report that under IP and system is that the reason that number is so high?", "Trac Pham", "You mean, why are we reporting IP and systems together.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "No, no I'm just conforming that that is the case, that you prototyping revenue IP and systems?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, it is correct. We are reporting those together. The trailing 12-months growth was actually quite high. And but you may also remember from last year that IP goes up and down quite a bit. And we've said that the IP is double-digit growth on a multiyear basis. And the reason for that is that the nature of that business, the fact that they're often milestones attached to deliverables and we said last year that this would be a good year and so far it looks like it is.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Okay. So one question on the 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer from the foundries and from the semi companies we're hearing lot of change in the timing and pushing out, pushing in, are you seeing a different kind of behavior on migration to 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer considered that we have different set of players on the foundry and side and also on the product side, if you can compare it to the previous years, I mean design transitions that would be helpful?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Let me distinguish something which is let me take the whole grouping of 28 nanometer and higher, and then 20 nanometer as an individual node, and then the FinFET category somewhat actually have 22 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, and 10 nanometer. The 20 nanometer node is really little bit of an off-duck and TSMC have been successful with that. But we have predicted already a longtime ago that it would probably be a node that would not see a lot of utilization; because once the vision to FinFET is established and that's the yields look good enough people will rapidly move there. That appears to be the case.", "At the same time for all the people that don't want to cross the bridge to FinFET 28 nanometer will be a node that will be utilized massively for a quite longtime. And so that sort of the way we look at it a little bit which is 28 nanometer is sort of the one side of the bridge with plainer transistors, 16 nanometer is really the other side of the bridge with FinFETs, and then from there you go on to smaller dimension.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Okay. And one more question related to that, but really further looking we know that the FinFET enabled the Moore's Law beyond 20 nanometer, and there is already a talk about FinFET probably be sufficient for may be a couple of generation and then it will another transistor structure change, a material change. Do you have the -- do you want that that we have to change the material structure very soon or this can take you few for few generations?", "Aart de Geus", "Well our sense is that so this can go for a few generations right now. At the same time we are fields where relentless and ingenuity is a necessity to overcome the intricacy of very, very small physic. So at some point of time the very nature of the transistor will change again.", "It's always fascinating to me to remember that not that many years ago, I'm taking six or seven years ago, many people said FinFET will never work, and here we are. And so by the way the term Moore's Law of course is by now more of a concept than an actual exact law because the economics with these type of chips are changing a bit, but there's no question that the opportunity of fabulous products as we move to smaller transistors is still very, very appealing.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Okay. That's very helpful, Art. Thank you very much.", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions.", "Aart de Geus", "In that case, thank you very much for attending our first quarter's earnings release so we had good results, and we feel confident about the year, and we have a lot of work to do to finish the year. Thank you very much. Have a good rest of the day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 4 o'clock Pacific Time today through March 4.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will have a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa K. Ewbank - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys, and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.", "All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were very strong and solidify our outlook for the full year. We delivered revenue of $557 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 and $155 million in operation cash flow. We're raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance, with a range of $2.210 billion to $2.235 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS objective to a range of $2.76 to $2.81, double-digit growth at the midpoint.", "Trac will discuss these results in more detail shortly. In the semiconductor and systems markets we serve, we continue to see unevenness in terms of business success, with some companies doing very well, while others are challenged, whether in particular verticals or geographies.", "Nonetheless, firms continue to invest aggressively in advanced design to build the next great chip for the next great product. In that, they rely on Synopsys as a critical partner. These products feature the most complex electronic systems in the world, spanning the entire continuum of Silicon to Software. Ranging from ever-smaller transistors and abundant sensors, to the critical communication and supporting cloud infrastructures, to embedded software and more and more sophisticated applications, the resulting interactions between big data, communication, and computation are leading rapidly to the age of Smart Everything.", "In the decade to come, advances in this space will again bring about unparalleled new capabilities that just a few years ago, felt like far-away science fiction. Synopsys is well positioned. Our EDA solutions enable the most advanced chips, our IP business greatly boosts designer productivity, and recently, our software quality and security tools address the complexity of both embedded and applications software, and thus expand our traditional TAM. In addition, our global teams are focused on exceptional customer relationships and differentiated technology support.", "Building on this vision, last year, we launched a multi-year market strategy based on three pillars: First, build on our leadership in EDA by providing the state-of-the-art toolsets required to design the next generation of chips. Second, grow our IP offering as one of the highest-impact productivity mechanisms available to design highly complex chips under unrelenting time-to-market constraints. And third, invest in and grow our software quality and security solutions, as embedded software expands massively into next-generation electronic systems, and the security vulnerabilities of application software create more and more challenges in our day-to-day lives.", "Let me provide some highlights on each of these, starting with EDA. The technical challenges facing semiconductor and systems companies are driving substantial investments in the most advanced, as well as more established, process geometries. The number of designs using power-efficient FinFET transistors at sizes as small as 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, and 10-nanometer is growing rapidly, as leading-edge companies race forward.", "The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date again grew almost 15% in just the last quarter, to well over 200. Synopsys is relied on for approximately 95% of these, and our momentum continues, as more and more enterprises commit to FinFET and count on us for success.", "For example, last month, we announced TSMC certification for Synopsys design tools for 16-nanometer of FinFET Plus production, and for 10-nanometer early design starts. And during the quarter, we displaced a competitor at one of its traditional Asian strongholds accounts for advanced 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes.", "While leading-edge designs are moving as fast as possible to FinFET, many advanced designs continue to be on 28-nanometer, which is expected to have a long life cycle. Our innovations pioneered for advanced FinFET designs are also bringing remarkable benefits to 28-nanometer circuit, as well as to more established nodes such as 40-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and 90-nanometer.", "Our custom design solution is also gaining strength, and in fact we successfully displaced the incumbent at a global medical device company, who is now using a complete Synopsys digital-and-custom flow.", "Relevant here, and a year after its announcement, it's worth reporting on our new flagship place and route product: IC Compiler II. In a word, it's doing great. IC Compiler II has proven to be a true game-changer for a fast-growing group of customers. And we can report tremendous demand and excellent business momentum. We're currently already serving 32 customers with more than 70 in-progress design efforts. This is up 40% from last quarter. With more than 90 production designs and tape-outs, IC Compiler II is used on numerous process nodes from 40-nanometer, 28-nanometer to the most advanced 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer and 10-nanometers. These are production designs, not test chips.", "Customers report that IC Compiler II is dramatically faster than any tool on the market today, including next generation offerings touted by competitors.", "In a number of cases, we take half to just a quarter of the time of competitor tools \u2013 with runtimes of hours versus days. These runtimes are achieved while the quality of results reported by users is superior as well. In March, for example, Toshiba cited \"unprecedented runtime speedup and superior quality of results\" by IC Compiler II, as experienced on its 40-nanometer SoC tape-out. At our recent Users Group meeting here in Silicon Valley, customers including Toshiba, Renesas, MediaTek and ARM spoke about their successes with the tool.", "From a business perspective, demand is very high, even in these early stages. And over the last three quarters, we've seen the fastest-ever ramp-up in orders for a new product. With our June release, which includes further enhanced functionality, IC Compiler II will be available to all customers.", "Now moving to verification, where approximately 80% of advanced designs rely on the Synopsys solution as their primary simulator. Q2 was a record quarter for our verification tools, reflecting early momentum for our Verification Continuum Platform, with particularly strong results for our emulation system. Verification is the biggest bottleneck in chip design today.", "To address this, our Verification Continuum platform contains all of the key capabilities, from our franchise VCS functional simulator, to static and formal analysis, to verification IP, to emulation and prototyping \u2013 all aligned on a common infrastructure, with best-in-class debugging. The platform was developed and continues to evolve in close collaboration with key customers. It has already been integral to large renewals and competitive wins.", "We introduced the first components last year, including Verification Compiler, which integrates many of the software elements. Customer interest is high, as evidenced by adoption not only by chip companies, but also by several very large systems companies in the quarter. Here too, high-value additional features and further integration will roll-out through the rest of the year.", "Let me now move to our second strategic priority of growing our IP and Prototyping product lines. The Synopsys IP value proposition is compelling. We are the number one supplier of interface, analog, memory, and physical semiconductor IP, with a reputation for highest quality, reliability, and technical excellence.", "The business continues to grow, with our IP being used in the most complex chips in the world, from advanced FinFET processes to those targeting automotive, industrial and Internet of Things applications. Based on our very broad availability of proven FinFET IP, we have established clear leadership in FinFET IP development.", "This quarter, for example, we announced immediate availability of our silicon-proven IP in TSMC's 16-nanometer of FinFET Plus processes. We also closed a significant agreement with another major foundry to enable broad Synopsys IP on multiple FinFET and 28-nanometer processes. Development of our 10-nanometer IP portfolio is in full swing with multiple customers and partners.", "We've had a number of important customer wins, including Broadcom, which extended its license agreement providing access to Synopsys' ARC processors for an expanded range of advanced multimedia and networking designs. Meanwhile, electronics are getting smarter, enabling us to run our lives from wherever we are, at any time. Synopsys is at the forefront of delivering IP optimized for Smart Everything applications. For example, we announced a new embedded vision processor that enables designers to efficiently include capabilities such as object detection, gesture recognition and video surveillance in their products.", "Our sensor subsystem is showing momentum, with multiple wins in the quarter with high-profile customers. To address this growing complexity, our prototyping tools enable accelerated software development, hardware/software integration, and validation of the entire system. We're seeing good repeat orders for our HAPS FPGA prototyping system by companies developing leading-edge mobile SoCs, as well as adoption of our software-based solution in the automotive space.", "Turning now to strategic priority number three: Grow our TAM by building a new adjacent business in software quality and security. A year after acquiring and integrating Coverity, we've learned the following: Coverity was a great acquisition, a compelling combination of the familiar and the new, and a platform we can build on. Specifically, we acquired excellent technology, the expanded customer base, and a brand new TAM.", "In order to scale the operations to a grander level, it'll take ongoing investments in sales and marketing, as well as in R&D. We're confident in the opportunity in front of us, and understand how to leverage Synopsys' experience in scaling the business, and thus evolve a new growth engine.", "Our strategy is to build a compelling and differentiated platform through mainly organic investments in the quality space, and a combination of organic and M&A investments in the security space. To that end, we're expanding our position in software security with the acquisition of Codenomicon, a leader in the area of dynamic security analysis, and well-known for independently discovering the infamous Heartbleed bug. With this acquisition, which is expected to close during Q3, Synopsys can deliver a more comprehensive security offering for the software development lifecycle.", "To reflect our expanded presence, we've given the business group a new name, Software Integrity Group, which conveys our focus on software quality and security to help our customers develop complex software with rock-solid integrity. We expect the Software Integrity Group to be slightly dilutive in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, we are raising our overall guidance, reflecting strength in our overall business.", "In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter, which solidifies our outlook for the year. Financially, we delivered excellent results and are raising our annual revenue midpoint and non-GAAP EPS guidance range. We see clear momentum with our new implementation and verification products, where we're still in the early stages of a multi-year upgrade cycle. And our acquisition in the software security space will expand our presence in this highly important area.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Aart. And good afternoon, everyone. As reflected in our excellent Q2 financial results, we are seeing good momentum and strong execution in our business. We met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets provided last quarter. We delivered growth in revenue and non-GAAP earnings and generated considerable cash flow. Based on the strength of the first half and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising our 2015 outlook for revenue and non-GAAP earnings and reaffirming operating cash flow.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q2 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 8% to $557 million, reflecting solid organic and acquired-company growth. Greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%.", "The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.5 years. Duration will vary depending on customer requirements. We expect full year duration to be close to three years.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $481 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $420 million, at the lower end of our range, due largely to some delayed hiring. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.7%. Aligning with the multi-year strategy Aart outlined, we'll continue to drive company-wide operational discipline in order to fund our higher-growth initiatives. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.68.", "Turning to cash flow. We generated $155 million of operating cash flow and continue to target approximately $450 million for the year. We ended the quarter with total debt of $220 million. This includes $160 million from our revolver, which we used to fund the $180 million accelerated share repurchase in Q1, and $60 million from our term loan. As a reminder, the ASR is expected to be completed this quarter when the final shares are delivered.", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1 billion, with 15% onshore. Yesterday, we renewed and expanded our credit facility to $500 million. The revolver, which may be increased by an additional $150 million, provides excellent flexibility to support our strategy and business operations. We'll continue to optimize the use of cash to generate maximum long-term shareholder value. Each quarter, we will evaluate our M&A, buyback and debt reduction options to determine the best balance.", "DSO was 55 days and we ended Q2 with approximately 9,450 employees, with more than one third in lower-cost geographies.", "Now to our third quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter, our targets are: revenue between $550 million and $560 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $481 million and $501 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $430 million and $440 million, other income between zero and $2 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% to 22%, outstanding shares between 155 million to 159 million, GAAP earnings of $0.23 to $0.30 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.58 to $0.60 per share.", "For Fiscal 2015: revenue between $2.21 billion to $2.235 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 9%, other income between $6 million and $10 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%, outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million, GAAP earnings of $1.39 to $1.49 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $85 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.81 per share. We've raised our guidance range while taking into account the slight dilution we expect from our Software Integrity Group in the second half of the year, capital expenditures of approximately $100 million, and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.", "In summary, Q2 was another strong quarter. We delivered excellent financial results, highlighted by top and bottom-line growth, solid execution across our business lines, and strong cash flow generation. We are also increasing 2015 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, reflecting strong momentum in the first half and our confidence in the rest of the year.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Question on ICC II. Thank you for the update there, it sounds like there is a lot of momentum in the market. Just wondered if you would address some chatter out in the market about some maybe initial versions of ICC II having some QoR issues that needed to be cleaned up by ICC I runs. It sounded like if you had those, you are beyond them, but wondering if you would address those or not?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well, this is mostly noise that is related to any transition that you have. ICC II at this point in time is doing very complex chips extremely well and does not need any \u2013 I guess is supported by its older brother so to speak. At any point in time, people like to compare results from one tool to another, they like to see if it behaves in the same predictable fashion as they are accustomed to and IC Compiler II is just doing fabulously well in those comparisons. And more often than not, we get actually response from customers that involve quite a bit of surprise on their part. So having said that, it's a very complex product and we are in an intense move to get customers to move into production design with it that takes some effort and well on top of that.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "That's great. And then, with respect to the acquisition I wanted to clarify \u2013 is that baked into the guidance? It wasn't exactly clear to me if that was in the guidance or not in the guidance, that Codenomicon?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Rich. This is Trac. The Codenomicon is not backed into the guidance we've provided. But the impact should be immaterial and we won't be changing guidance as a result.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Now, when you had announced that, you'd said you thought it would close in 30 days, which is about where we are now. Anything we should know about? Why that hasn't closed in that timeframe?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "No, not really. These are just \u2013 there is certain amount of work that have to be done with the authorities locally and long track to execute on that.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "And so, I guess since that hasn't closed, that implies that Coverity will be slightly diluted in the second half of the year. Is that as expected?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "No. Actually, you probably remember that, when we originally acquired it, in our initial plan, we expect it to be breakeven in the second half of the year that \u2013 now, that we know much more and now that we've also decided to make some additional investments specifically in broadening the language coverage that is why we specifically communicated at the end of the second half it would be slightly dilutive. But it's very small and we essentially embedded this in the rest of the business for the company. So from that perspective, we still raise guidance.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "Got it, that makes sense. Aart, I just wanted to make sure that I heard you right. I thought you said you had a very strong emulation quarter; was that correct, in your prepared remarks?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, that was exactly what I said.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "And I was actually going to ask you if the sales of emulation had been affected at all by the lawsuit, that I guess you lost at least initially, at this point, with Mentor. And I'm guessing the answer that would be that they have not been adversely affected, but I'll let you answer that question.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. And I will minimize my comments on this, after the verdict of course there was a set of issues we have to deal with, the version that's on the market today does not violate any of that. And so, we see that our business is doing well.", "Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much, Aart, I appreciate it.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Rich.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I apologize, I got cut off for a part of the call, so if you said this in your prepared remarks, I do apologize. But around ICC II, I imagine most of the traction is with the existing customers. I'm just wondering \u2013 any commentary in terms of not-Synopsys teams that are starting to adopt this for some of their advanced chips?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well. As you would imagine, Synopsys has been serving the most advanced designers in the world pretty much a 100%. And so while there is always one or two hold outs, our first objective, obviously, is to make sure that's the hardest driving design groups that need it most, that do the largest chips, and by the way that also the most demanding are successful first, and I think we are doing remarkably well with that group of people. There are number of maybe less advanced designs or let me put it more \u2013 in the 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer category designs that are sometimes advanced but on less evolved silicon technologies that are also using the tool extremely effectively. And so, we have an opportunity here to broaden to companies that maybe before did not look at us as their primary provider for (26:13).", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, on the guidance for next quarter, specifically to the EPS, is the only increase in operating expenses the slight dilution the you are talking to, or is there some sales hiring or other operating expense investments that you are making, given where the range of EPS is coming in, relative to consensus?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "I'm sorry, Sterling, you're asking about the expense increase from Q2 to Q3? Is that right?", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "That's correct.", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, what you're going to see in the quarter-to-quarter comparison is the delayed hiring that we saw in Q2, as well as the merit increase for the second half of the year.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We've a question from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Yeah, hi. This is Andrew Masuda calling in for Tom. You guys mentioned that you guys had 15% of your cash onshore. I was just wondering if there was a minimum threshold that you would like to maintain for acquisitions and/or share repurchases?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "I'm sorry. In general, we tried to keep our U.S. cash flow at around $100 million, but keep \u2013 I should note that we did close our revolver yesterday and we increased that to from $350 million to $500 million. So the combination of the onshore cash right now of $150 million plus the increase revolver gives us a lot of flexibility.", "Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. And then, Aart, just a question on the software quality and security. Can you remind us how much that increases Synopsys' overall TAM?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "It's difficult to remind you, because I always struggle with that question. The reason I struggle is that the space of software productivity tools, software quality tools and then security is highly fragmented and sort of continually evolving. Our own sense initially is that the TAM probably grows by another $500 million or so. But I'll be the first one to say that depending on how one look at it can be much larger. I don't think it will be much smaller. But the security space is a little bit the wild west right now.", "Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Okay. And then just last question on IP and systems, I noticed that it just ticked down modestly in the April quarter. Can you talk about your expectations on that segment for the full year?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "From a quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to have very precise expectations. In general on a trailing-12 months basis, which is sort of what we mostly look at, it's up quite a bit. And the IP business by definition is somewhat lumpy, because there are number of deals that are large and ship immediately, there are some that require work to be done on a contract. And so, it can vary quite a bit. And last year for example was lower business growth than this year. So having said that I think the business is in good shape.", "Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thank you.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you. Good evening. Aart, I would like to ask about IC Compiler II as well. Just to clarify the business impact that you're seeing from its adoption, I believe you said, there are 32 customers now using it. Is it the case that most, if not all of them are paying you more now for its use versus what they would have paid you for the, let's say, equivalent number of licenses of its older brother, IC Compiler I? And if you could help us understand the incremental bookings and/or pricing or revenue implications of its adoption?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well for starters, the product itself is priced at a higher level than IC Compiler I. It has dramatically better capabilities, and of course is superefficient. Secondly, a number of customers as part of their multi-year contracts with us have an opportunity to remix into the next version, at which point in time, they use up more of that contract. And then lastly, as contracts come up for renewal, that is an excellent time to establish what's their level of commitments to Synopsys place and route is and IC Compiler II is doing extremely well with that. And so, having a history of fairly substantially new products in the past, not that we have something like IC Compiler II every few years or so, we nonetheless can absolutely see that the rate of business growth is excellent for it.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And a couple of questions for Trac. You mentioned hiring in an answer to, I think, Sterling's question earlier. In doing a spot check on your website, the number of open positions that you now have. And I know it's sometimes not the best reading of a company's plans, but you do now have largest number of open recs in about a year and a half, since the end of 2013. Could you help us understand how much of that intended hiring, or the people you are looking for, are in a more traditional core EDA business versus the new Software Integrity business?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "We definitely hire \u2013 are looking at to grow our investments in the Software Integrity Group as well as the IP and systems side. As we said, we will commit to growing in those spaces. Keep in mind that the head count at the end of Q2 is roughly flat with where we exited last year. So and for two quarters, now we've been behind our hiring so we should expect that to ramp up a little bit. But with that hiring in mind, I would just refer you back to the full year guidance, we still are at the midpoint of EPS, we're still looking to grow EPS by 10% and then we're still looking to increase operating margins by about 100 basis points year-over-year. So while we're hiring to support our business, we're mindful of the financial impact.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Okay. A couple more for you, Trac. Your core EDA business was up pretty nicely sequentially for first quarter to second quarter, or larger than usual increase. If we think about that in geo terms, would it be fair to say that most of that sequential increase would have been in Asia-Pac, and perhaps secondly in North America?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "It lines up because you do see that the growth in, the trailing 12 months growth for North America and Asia-Pac was pretty strong.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Yes. Okay. And your cost of revenues per product was actually down sequentially, in-spite of the fact that you had a strong emulation quarter. Perhaps you had a really nice increase in the margin on emulation, but should we perhaps read into that, that the HAPS business, also hardware of course, might have been down sequentially? And from a cost perspective might have offset the increments from emulation?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We're not concerned about that and we actually don't worry about the COGS line on a quarter-to-quarter basis. If you look at it over the last \u2013 this quarter as well as the last few quarter trend, it usually bounces around between 82% and 84% and we're well within that range, so, I wouldn't read anything into it.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then lastly for Aart, a somewhat technical question, so IC Compiler II, of course, has been on the market now for about a year. One of the things you talked about since you released it or when you released it, was its substantial capacity additions. Could you remind us what you've done for the other products that are closely tied to IC Compiler in implementation, particularly DC and PrimeTime and others, in terms of materially expanding their capacity to keep up, so to say, with the design sizes for IC Compiler II?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first taking the step back, the IC Compiler II was out or IC Compiler was somewhat off the bottleneck in the very, very large designs, because far and away the largest amount of data is attached to the physical representation of a design, which does mean that it's not desirable to have higher level of capacity on any of the other tools. And so \u2013 at any point of time when one tool solely does a lot better all of the other tools while being happy for the company, immediately realized that the pressure is on them now to continue to improve and, of course, that is exactly what we're doing, and so from time-to-time you will see new capabilities come out on any of the surrounding tools, and the practical situation, always you can't do it fast enough. So they're working hard on it.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, Aart. Thanks, Trac.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first on emulation, Aart, could you talk about \u2013 you talked about a strong growth in the emulation segment. What is your expectation for the growth of that business year-over-year and your views on the market as well?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't think I commented on the market. I said that emulation was strong in the quarter for us. But I put it really in the perspective of our broader mission, which is a Verification Continuum that really contains the cornerstones of simulation and, of course, emulation, but also number of other technology. And the reason that's important is because in reality, most designers use a broad set of tools and one of the things that really helps them is if the tools understand the electronic representation the same way, with other words if it can sit on the same infrastructure and if you can use the same debuggers, even if some of the tools are more appropriate for one thing than another.", "And so within that context that we have made outstanding progress specifically and making sure that the compilation techniques that we use for simulation and emulation line up very well, and about a year and half or so ago we had flagged that as one of the weaknesses in our offering. And I think right now, it's becoming rapidly a strength.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "So is it fair to assume your emulation standalone revenues growing at least double-digit year-over-year?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "You know Monika, we said that it's doing very well. We don't disclose the growth rates of individual product. They tend to go up and down, but I would reiterate that we think that we have a very strong emulation solution.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "Okay. Then on the Coverity, when it was bought, you talked about it growing at 20% growth rate. Could you maybe share how is that business doing on the growth rate basis?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's roughly on track. It is slightly differently dimensioned than when we originally acquired it, because we didn't quite know exactly how to read the numbers. We have concluded meanwhile that it is a business that has great opportunity and for that reason we realized after a while that our core strength is really the depths of the algorithms, specifically around the analysis of the languages. And that of course, beg the question, well, so which languages do you do, and we decided to invest in broadening that language sets.", "So I think there is still a lot of space to be explored here. And then the other broadening that we took on, of course, is to strengthen the security angle. Coverity already have some security capabilities, but they were not really well-known for it. Codenomicon is certainly a brand name, and it allows us to position a little bit better in this emerging space while at the same time, learning quite rapidly, what are actually the things that are most valuable to customers.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "Got it. Just a housekeeping question, if you look at maintenance and service line item, the first half of this year, the revenues about $130 million, but last year was about $102 million. So it's something going on there? Or is there some reclassification of revenue in this line item?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Are you talking about service?", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "Yeah, maintenance and service line item, yes?", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, those tend to go up and down quite a bit. They are very lumpy because a lot of these are directly related to certain contracts having milestones, and the milestones can be very unevenly spread. And so, the service business is not very large for us. And so, I wouldn't read very much into it. The very fact that I wasn't even unaware of what you just said shows that we are \u2013 ourselves maybe we can pay more attention to it, but we didn't.", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. That's all for me.", "Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go to Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. Another IC Compiler question, Aart. We estimate that the addressable market for place and route about $600 million growing more at mid-single digit. If you can give your opinion on that? And also if you can talk about comparative positioning, because your competitors also claiming significant design wins in that area. So if you can comment on that, that would be helpful.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well. I cannot comment about the \u2013 what a competitor says. If they're growing, that's good, that means the whole market is growing even more. We are certainly doing very well and have been the largest provider in that segment of the market for quite a while. And so, what makes that market interesting and challenging is that it's the first place where all the new challenges of new technologies come through both in terms of the physics, but also in terms of the sheer complexity off of the chips that have to go through the tools. And in that context, IC Compiler II, I think is passing the test with flying colors and that is why we've seen the business actually do very well around IC Compiler II. And as a matter of fact, the run rate for the whole company is up. And so, IC Compiler was certainly a cornerstone in the things that we wanted to accomplish this year.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And another question, you made a comment on 28-nanometer being a bigger node in your opening statement. I guess you were probably referring that 28-nanometer is staying much longer than \u2013 and you're seeing new designs. Does that have any implication on how things progress for your business? Does that imply that advanced technology is slower, but it doesn't matter to you. You'll go by \u2013 I mean you're benefiting from a number of designs, not necessarily has to be the leading edge?", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "That's a very good question. And you may recall that I fairly strongly predicted this. I would say four quarters to six quarters ago already and there is a logic to it, which is no matter what's the difference between 28-nanometer and then the 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer and so on. FinFET is that 28-nanometer is what's called planar transistors or flat, right, whereas FinFET as a name says Fins, they are vertical. And so that is a fairly big physical change, when you think about it. And so there is a reason, one would go after such a change, because the benefits are very large for very sophisticated advanced designs that also need very low-power. So no surprise the people that go there first are the processors and are the people that do a mobility, because they have very complex chips and need low-power.", "Now, contrary to popular opinion, it's not just two customers or three customers that have gone there. It's a larger number already. But it is also true that for many of the others. They sort of way to see as others have crossed the bridge, how that's going, when are the economics right, where is the yield is really predictable all the things that you do, if you don't see a super high advantage in being in the most advanced nodes.", "But then now you are right about 28-nanometer, which is a very, very solid node, very high yields, a good cost point and so on. And you say well, I still want to differentiate. And so now you're doing very advanced design on 28-nanometer node, which by the way is just as difficult, it's just the type of difficulty you already know about. And so, it's in that context that many of the benefits of IC Compiler II that we're pioneered with, obviously, the intent to be able to satisfy the FinFET crowd have actually very positive impact on the 28-nanometer, and actually we see a number of people also do very well at 40-nanometer. And you look at that configuration, and you say, hey! that makes sense. It's economics that determines when people go over the bridge, and right now the 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer group is arriving at 28-nanometer and we'll be looking when to cross into FinFET when it makes economic sense.", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And I'll turn it back to our presenters for closing remarks.", "Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer", "Well, at this point in time, I hope that you heard that we had a very solid and strong quarter with a number of key products that we had invested in for a number of years. These products are doing well. It's early in the comprehensive rollouts, but it is a very promising and it's certainly technology that applies to all the new designs being done. And with that, for those of you that joined us at the individual session, we'll see you later, and thank you very much for your time.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Davidson", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities", "Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities", "Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode, and later, we will have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]", "Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release.", "The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.", "All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to report that our third quarter results were very strong, as we achieved revenue of $556 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 and $275 million in cash flow from operations. In addition, we closed several key acquisitions, as we continue to strengthen and evolve the company for long-term growth. As a result, we are again raising our annual revenue guidance.", "Characterizing the customer environment around us, the semiconductor and systems industry results and outlook remain mixed. Customer growth rates appear more challenged than three months ago as some customers thrive while others struggle.", "Consequently, consolidation continues, be it through asset purchases or full company combinations. While consolidations overall are somewhat of a headwind for EDA, our customers continue to invest heavily in designing highly advanced chips.", "They seek long-term relationships with trusted suppliers to meet the very demanding time-to-market expectations of their customers. In addition, our expansion into the software quality and security space has broadened our long-term opportunity to grow well beyond traditional EDA. Thus, Synopsys, continues to be well-positioned as partner of choice for electronic design and software development.", "Ranging from silicon to software, our multi-year strategy has three pillars. First, continue to build on our EDA leadership by providing state-of-the-art design and verification platforms with best-in-class support.", "Second, offer high-impact productivity solutions such as outsourced IP and extremely fast hardware/software prototyping, enabling customers to beat their relentless time-to-market constraints.", "And third, invest in and grow our software quality and security solutions. Software complexity is escalating in both electronic systems and in the broader application space, and security vulnerabilities are visibly creating ever-greater challenges.", "Let me provide some product and customer highlights that demonstrate our progress. Throughout our entire history, Synopsys has endeavored to be the technology leader in the highest impact areas of EDA. The investments we\u2019ve made both internally and through acquisitions continue to bear fruit in terms of, new game-changing products, clear leadership in advanced node enablement, amazing customer design successes and the resulting customer wins. While I\u2019m sure it\u2019s difficult for you to sort through the many claims of leadership in advanced designs, we are confident in our position and momentum.", "Let me provide some color and data points. The number of FinFET designs continues to grow rapidly, as leading-edge companies race to take advantage of significant power efficiencies.", "The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date continues to grow quickly now reaching almost 240. Synopsys is relied on for 95% of these. Technology differentiation matters, and customers and partners count on us.", "For example, in June, we announced Intel Custom Foundry certification for Synopsys design tools for 14-nanometer FinFET production. During the quarter, we achieved certification from multiple standards organizations for our IP portfolio for TSMC 16-nanometer FinFET-Plus and in June, we announced an expanded collaboration with UMC on embedded memory and test solutions for their 14-nanometer FinFET process.", "In physical design, our game-changing new product, IC Compiler II, continues to gain traction with rapidly growing adoption. Customers are seeing 10X improvement in throughput and are using IC Compiler II in designs throughout the process spectrum.", "During Design Automation Conference in June, AMD, ARM, MediaTek, SocioNext and Samsung spoke to a standing-room-only crowd about their successes and deployment plans for IC Compiler II. TSMC signed off on IC Compiler II certification for their latest 16 nanometer FinFET Plus process.", "Demand is very strong and broad-based, as evidenced by the fastest ramp-up in bookings for any product in our history. As customers move rapidly from IC Compiler I to IC Compiler II, so does our support. We have transitioned a majority of our dedicated application engineers to IC Compiler II, a further indication of its momentum. We are already serving 38 different customer logos with well over 100 production designs and tape-outs, a significant increase over last quarter.", "Now to verification, where requirements have exploded as designs have become much, much more complex. Here, too, our Verification Continuum platform is truly a next-generation solution with both breadth and depth of technology. Approximately 80% of advanced designs already use Synopsys as the primary simulator and over the past year, we have steadily introduced many enhancements and a whole different level of integration throughout the platform.", "Propelled by multi-year collaborations with some of the hardest-driving semiconductor companies in the world, our Verification Continuum now integrates all the critical software and hardware verification tools onto a common infrastructure. As a result, Q3 was another strong quarter for verification, particularly in emulation, where growing demand is benefitting the entire EDA industry.", "At the Design Automation Conference, Altera, ARM, Cavium, AMD and Freescale spoke at a customer luncheon about their verification challenges and how Synopsys is helping them achieve success. On the analog/mixed-signal side, a technically challenging area, we introduced significant advances in our CustomSim product, which delivers a 2X speed-up.", "Finally, earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Atrenta, a recognized leader in static and formal verification. Its SpyGlass product is an anchor technology in the industry that effectively addresses verification and power challenges early in the design cycle.", "The Atrenta technologies further enhanced both our Verification Continuum platform and our implementation solution. While we\u2019re in the early stages of integration, customer and employee reactions have been very positive.", "Let me now move to IP, where our optimized solutions for the Automotive and Internet-of-Things market segments continue to strengthen. About six months ago, we launched a major initiative to robustly address the automotive space by augmenting our product portfolio to include automotive-grade IP.", "In June, we rolled-out a broad set of IP optimized for automotive chip development. The portfolio now meets key safety, reliability and quality requirements while continually being enhanced to address new emerging standards. We have also worked with industry leaders such as Freescale, Infineon and Renesas to create Automotive Centers of Excellence with our virtual prototyping products, enabling our mutual customers to accelerate software development.", "Clearly, semiconductor content in automotive systems will grow significantly over the next five to six years. With this offering, we are expanding our influence in this", "important vertical market segment.", "For the Internet of Things, the ability to connect multiple smart devices to the cloud and to each other is fueling great application innovation, ranging from wearable devices to machine-to-machine markets. Synopsys provides a comprehensive portfolio of IoT-ready IP, ranging from interfaces, to memory and logic, to power-efficient processors, to pre-validated subsystems.", "During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with TSMC to develop an integrated IoT platform for TSMC\u2019s 40 nanometer ultra-low-power process. We also acquired Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision, for key low-power smart home, portable health, and industrial applications that require on-chip wireless integration.", "Lastly, and second only to connectivity, security of these devices is paramount. Through the acquisition of Elliptic Technologies, we added proven security IP solutions for identification, authentication, data encryption and content protection, which brings me naturally to our Software Quality and Security products. While security in the cyber world has been an issue for years, the combination of increasing connectivity and highly publicized breaches, including recently in the automotive domain, are spurring an intense security focus on the entire electronics and software applications space.", "Our entry into Software Quality and Security comes at just the right time and Q3 was significant for our promising business unit. As a refresher, last year\u2019s Coverity acquisition expanded both our total available market and our customer base. It\u2019s a compelling combination of technical, customer and channel adjacency to our existing business as well as a significant TAM broadening into a new, higher-growth space that truly differentiates us as a company and investment.", "During the quarter, we bolstered our security presence significantly with two acquisitions that are already showing great promise. The first is cyber security company, Codenomicon, a leader in the area of dynamic security analysis, and well-known for independently discovering the infamous Heartbleed bug.", "We also acquired key assets from Quotium, specifically, the well-regarded Seeker product, a leader in application security testing. While we're in the early stages of building and scaling our presence in this space, we're already making a notable impact. Evident earlier in the month at the Black Hat security conference, a conference renowned for its hacker, and security company attendees.", "For example, at a standing-room-only Synopsys event that featured speakers from Underwriter's Laboratories and the Department of Homeland Security, UL spoke about its developing Cybersecurity Assurance Program and the collaboration with Synopsys to drive it forward.", "It\u2019s designed to help companies manage security risks via a certification process, similar to what they have been doing for years for electrical hardware devices. UL's program, which is still under development, is expected to provide a baseline for Cybersecurity Assurance. Initially focused on medical devices, industrial control systems, and networking and telecom equipment, it would utilize technology from a number of key suppliers, including Synopsys.", "Finally, reflecting the growing brand recognition in this space, we were named by Gartner as a visionary in their application Security Testing\u2019s Magic Quadrant. This is a big deal. Out of hundreds of companies in the Application Security Testing space, only 19 are identified in this market-making group. Stay tuned as we evolve our software quality and security strategy in the coming months and quarters.", "In summary, we delivered strong Q3 results and expect to exit the year with approximately 10% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our new products are driving excellent customer design successes and adoption momentum. And, lastly, we closed several key acquisitions, strengthening our technology and evolving Synopsys towards promising higher-growth market segments.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Aart, we're seeing good momentum in the business. Our internal investments and key acquisitions are paying off in terms of broadening our portfolio with new technology and expanding our TAM with new growth opportunities.", "Our results reflect a business that is not only strong today, but also well positioned for future opportunities. Our excellent Q3 performance and Q4 outlook solidify another year of increased growth and profitability. In fact, we're raising our annual revenue outlook again, reflecting the strength of our business. We continue to execute very well, and we are committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q3 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 6.5% to $556 million. Greater than 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%.", "The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.5 years, and we expect duration for the full year to be about 2.7 years. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $494 million and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $432 million, at the lower end of our target range.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.4% for the quarter and 24.2% for the first three quarters of 2015. Because of the technical complexity inherent in our customers' design processes, it's critical that we prioritize leading edge product development. Nonetheless, we continue to drive global operational efficiency in order to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range.", "GAAP earnings per share were $0.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.63.", "Turning to cash flow, we generated $275 million of operating cash flows for the quarter. We are reiterating our full year target of approximately $450 million.", "Cash flows to date have been strong and we are able to offset the net outflows related to acquisitions. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion with 31% onshore and total debt of $213 million. We have since funded the Atrenta acquisition from that U.S. cash, so would expect it to be lower at the end of Q4.", "Over the years we have utilized our balance sheet very effectively for both stock repurchases and M&A. Since 2010, we have repurchased more than $1.1 billion of Synopsys stock. We have simultaneously made a number of important acquisitions to enter new higher growth areas, most recently software quality and security, and prioritized P&L investments to expand our technology leadership. We believe this ongoing strategy will create significant value for our shareholders.", "We closed several acquisitions in Q3, as well as Atrenta earlier this month. In addition, we completed the $180 million accelerated share repurchase plan initiated in Q1, in which we bought back a total of 4 million shares. For the trailing four quarters we've spent $220 million buying back more than 5 million shares, and have $200 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.", "Finally, DSO was 50 days, and we ended Q3 with approximately 9,835 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies.", "Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, our targets are revenue between $570 million and $585 million, a wider range than we have provided in the past, to reflect increased variability due to lumpiness of hardware and consulting revenue; total GAAP costs and expenses between $503 million and $521 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $450 million and $460 million; other income between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.31 to $0.38 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.65 to $0.67 per share.", "For fiscal 2015, revenue of $2.225 billion to $2.240 billion, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%; other income between $10 million and $12 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $1.43 to $1.50 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $87 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.78 per share, which reflects the slight dilution from our recent acquisitions, largely offset by operational overachievement; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.", "While we continue to expect a revenue model that is approximately 90% time-based, going forward we will expand our quarterly guidance ranges to better reflect the variability inherent in hardware deals, for which revenue is recognized upfront, along with the timing of consulting projects.", "In summary, we're seeing good momentum in the business. Our internal investments and key acquisitions are paying off, with game-changing new technology and a brand new TAM. We continue to deliver strong results and are well-positioned for future opportunities. And our excellent Q3 performance and Q4 outlook solidify another year of strong cash flow and increased growth and profitability.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Valera with Needham. Please go ahead.", "Krysten Sciacca", "Hi. This is Krysten Sciacca in for Needham. I don\u2019t know sorry in for Rich Valera. So I am looking at your fiscal 2015 guidance and I just want to know, is the increase in revenues only due to the inclusion of Atrenta or is there some other driving force there?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, most of that is not due to Atrenta, that is continuation of the execution of the overall company engine so to speak. Atrenta, of course, adds a little bit to it by virtue of having joined us this quarter, but most of it is just continuation of the path that Synopsys has been on.", "Krysten Sciacca", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then how is hardware this quarter?", "Aart de Geus", "We had a very good hardware quarter and so you will see that reflected in both the upfront revenue line as well our COGS expenses.", "Krysten Sciacca", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Aart de Geus", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We have question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Yes. Hi. I had a few questions actually. First one is, Aart, when I look at your IP system software integrity revenue, it seems like it is down sequentially about 10%. What is going on there that Coverity should be growing at this point, right?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, those businesses combined have actually a very high degree of fluctuation from a one quarter to another because they are quite lumpy in how we recognize revenue. And this is largely due because many of the large IP deals have a variety of milestones attached to them or even some services. And so that is why these numbers have continued to be up and down. On a trailing 12-month basis, the numbers are actually very good.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. And then in the past you guys mentioned how you should be breakeven in Coverity this year and you know accretive next year, but looks like you\u2019re doing some investments. So at what point, will Coverity become accretive to the broader company?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, we look at it being slightly accretive in '16. The addition of acquisitions may change that as they always do, but fundamentally read that as we continue to invest in the business that we see a very good future for.", "Krish Sankar", "But at some point next year, you\u2019re saying Coverity would be accretive?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. This would be as the -- the Coverity that we acquired, by now we\u2019ve already added I think four different acquisitions. And so this is a very rapidly evolving business unit for us. And so from a philosophy point of view, the way to think about it is that as we add acquisitions, we aim to within I would say 12 to 18 months make them accretive, or if they are technology acquisitions, they get integrated very, very fast into the existing product. And objective obviously is to build a profitable business, but the other objective is to also create a strong footprint in an area that we expect to grow in the future.", "Trac Pham", "Krish, this is Trac. I think you're referencing what we had originally guided when we bought Coverity in general. As we look at '16, we're looking at that business to be more than $100 billion and accretive, '16.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it.", "Trac Pham", "And as you think about the acquisitions that we made in the recent quarter, as you saw in the earnings guidance we have tweaked our earnings guidance to reflect the slight dilution from those deals and we do expect them to be slightly diluted in 2016 as well.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. And then if I could ask a big picture question. If you look at the EDA industry, everyone says it could grow at like 5%, 6% topline growth, but looks like next year 10 nanometers have been pushed out from 2016 to 2017. So my question is that with that backdrop, do you still think EDA industry can grow 6% or so, and what is it means specifically to Synopsys given 10 nanometers from some of the biggest customers are getting pushed out?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, let me take it still in reverse order. Yes, of course, we understand that some deliveries on technology have been slowed down or just feathered in, but that doesn\u2019t mean at all that the work for us has diminished around 10 nanometers, because a lot of people are essentially looking as when do they ship product and that is really the more relevant data from a macro perspective for the semiconductor industry.", "But for EDA, the work starts long, long before that. And as a matter of fact, we have a significant amount of work right now already on 7-nanometer to make the technologies, the tools, the IP ready.", "So if you look at it as a macro picture, I did guide a bit in my preamble to the fact that the overall semiconductor industry is quite turbulent right now. And if you look at the expectations for this year and for next year in terms of growth rate of the industry, they have gone down somewhat. But it is also true that within these ups and downs of the semiconductor industry, historically EDA has fared quite well, because not only do we attach the more stable R&D efforts, we also are very much the investments that let people come back out of the troughs within a year or two. And so therefore, a high degree of stability.", "Last but not least within that, I think Synopsys has done particularly well, because we are -- I hope viewed as a trusted partner and the company that you can count on and we continue to invest quite aggressively in technology to make sure that we\u2019re there tomorrow as well.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. And if I can just squeeze one last question. In the last several quarters of for like few years, your R&D as a percentage of sales has been somewhere in the 30% to low 30% range. Is there any chance for that, even if Moore\u2019s Law does slowdown and I understand you still have to do a lot of design work? Is there an opportunity for that R&D as a percentage of sales to come down or you think 30 is the bogey?", "Aart de Geus", "I honestly think that that is about the bogey and for the simple reason that we\u2019re seeing nothing that says that technology is getting somewhere. In many ways, it\u2019s the opposite. And the reason people go there is because the value is extremely high if you could deliver chips that had even less power utilization with even more computational speed, because in the coming years it will open up a whole new domain of smart devices that literally applies to everything.", "Now that complexity comes from at a minimum two sources. One is the advanced silicon technologies that just demand much more sophisticated modeling, and we are well on top of that. And secondly is that very sophisticated silicon is what enabling a lot of these super sophisticated software and the intersection of those two were also well on top of that.", "And so, I think, that we are in the right place, while we see an industry that is morphing and changing around us and this happens continually in this industry and has been one of the reasons for its tremendous impact.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. Thanks, Aart. Thanks Trac.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty", "Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the Atrenta question for a minute. I thought 2014 they were doing something in kind of 55 million range, what did you guys loose for acquisition accounting, it seem like you should get some material revenue for the back half -- even for the one quarter and then moving into 2016?", "Trac Pham", "Hi, Sterling. This is Trac. Yeah. The acquisitions have a very small impact on our results for this year. If you think about just the size of the deals in general, the timing of when they're closed and you factor in the deferred haircut, the guidance that we gave is, there is very little impact from revenues.", "We did tweak the earnings guidance at the midpoint by about penny or $0.02 to reflect a dilution. But overall most of it is in the -- most it is organic business. We -- when we think about the deferred haircut. It can range anywhere from 50% to 80% depending on particular deal.", "Sterling Auty", "Right. So can you give some guidelines in terms of where you at the upper end of that range on these acquisitions in terms of what the write-down was and perhaps, you can remind people what the business model at Atrenta was in terms of what have been in deferred revenue that perhaps were lost?", "Trac Pham", "So we don\u2019t disclose the specifics of each individual deal. But, again, where we are operationally, we are still working through the contracts to get evaluation analysis of that and to determine the deferred haircut.", "Aart de Geus", "But fundamentally, their business model is ratable model or just like ours and so in many ways they had a very similar philosophy both financially and technically, and I think the fit is actually going to be remarkably good.", "Sterling Auty", "And then looking at the sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, it seems to come in light relative to the street models and our model as well. Any insight into why the sales and marketing expenses were -- what looks to be as much as [$4 million, $4.3 million] [ph] spike?", "Trac Pham", "Sterling, the difference between where we came in versus the model is really just a function of how you model it. As far as internally that that the sale and marketing line can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on conditions expense it could vary by customer events or tradeshows. So it does vary quarter-to-quarter.", "Sterling Auty", "And there is one\u2026", "Trac Pham", "But there is no issue there. It\u2019s a reflection of the underlying health of the business that\u2019s what you are try to get out the run rates for the quarter and year-to-date were actually very healthy and up.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then, one last high level question, Aart, you kind of talk about the headwinds in the near-term is going to help semiconductors and just the M&A environment? I am particularly interested in terms of some of the consolidations that have happened? Is there a sense over what timeframe you might yield some of impacts of those consolidations and I do agree that I think ultimately will end up with healthier customer. So maybe it\u2019s even better for your long-term? But are we going to go into a six-month, 12-month, 18-month period, where perhaps as you go through contract renewals, you have a little bit of headwind? [Technical Difficulty] could you quantify or give qualitative commentary would be helpful?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, in general the reason one looks at consolidation as a bit of headwind for an industry is because none of the consolidators ever says, well, not that consolidated, let me spend more money with you.", "They do regroup however and often reassess what is the wisest way to spend their money and in a number of cases this has been actually very positive for us, because we're not only a safe haven in times of turbulence, but also by virtue of driving technology very hard, if this is an advanced user of this there is opportunity sometimes to align better with us making them successful.", "So the timeline that you are highlighting around consolidation is correct. It takes typically a number of months for the companies to figure out what they want to do. Many of the EDA companies have multiyear contracts. They can shift based on mutual agreements but there is some stability in all of this.", "So I don't want to over dramatize any of this. I think this is part of the industry that is evolving and we are visibly so, there are non-industry-related pressure points by virtue of what we see in the overall markets, in the stock market and some of the currency changes.", "And this all comes to their at the very moment that there is also big technology change and as a company, Synopsys, we've been through this many times in our history, and I think, we know what to do, but it is also true that the better we execute here, the better we will do.", "Sterling Auty", "All right. If I may, just want to squeeze one more in, we watched the technology leapfrog one another between yourselves and Cadence for many, many years, in terms of the industry. I think, Cadence has been very upfront in terms of they believe that they have been gaining share on the software. Aart, you not have that conversation, in terms of percentage of valet. So what I am particularly interested in is IC Compiler II, have you hit that inflection point and do you think we're about to go through a leapfrog back the other way?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for starters, let me respectfully disagree with your notion that we\u2019ve seen leapfrogging between our companies. I think that I would humbly submit that for majority of the products for our entire history, Synopsys has been the state-of-the-art and that is not to degenerate anybody else\u2019s products because all of these products are hypersophisticated and at times can get very good results for specific customer situation.", "I think said that, it\u2019s a very nature of both companies or all the EDA companies being actually very strong, that has propelled technology forward and is one of the key drivers behind the success of Moore\u2019s Law. And so I expect that race to continue. Specifically, an IC Compiler II, we are getting now very systemically, very strong results. And the challenge that we face is the great opportunity, it\u2019s not the challenge approving that we have strong technology. It is to now help migrate our customers to the next generation.", "And we sort of reported to you a number of the chips being done but underneath this, there is actually much more activity in the number of chip blocks that are being migrated with Synopsys actually quite substantial. And so while there is a lot of hard work that\u2019s left to be done, I highlighted the fact that most of our support engineers now are already on IC Compiler II. And we consider that situations where the customer has sort of voted for the long term.", "Sterling Auty", "Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "We have a question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yeah. Good afternoon. One more question on the consolidation front. Historically, have you seen the biggest impact in EDA based on the number of engineers or seats that have gone away or is it just the customers get better pricing because of volume discounting?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s an excellent question. I think as far as I can tell, engineers don\u2019t go away. And what happens is that in consolidations, the company that buys other company the minute it closes by nature has to push on efficiency for starters to try to repay or recoup the premium that they paid. And so it\u2019s really an efficiency mechanism in an industry.", "Now that efficiency can also manifest itself on the technology side where company say well you know we now have more critical mass in an area or we vertically integrate and we can have a more technical differentiation. And so as an earlier question highlighted, the opportunity space tends to grow after some period of time because the resulting companies are actually in most cases truly healthier and are aimed at the next decade of success.", "And so for us, it is be responsive to the customers as they are often in a financial time of need situation but at the same time keep an eye on making sure that we\u2019re in the game for the long term. And most importantly that we deliver something for the customers that truly increases their value and their differentiation going forward.", "Tom Diffely", "Did they just view that as an inflection points whether there is some share shifting that goes on as well?", "Aart de Geus", "I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t understand the question.", "Tom Diffely", "When you look at consolidations, do you look at it as an opportunity for maybe some share shifting going on?", "Aart de Geus", "Yeah. Absolutely. Sorry. Yeah, of course, there is always share adjustments in various ways. And historically, we have been blessed with having been chosen while often than not in a number of categories to become the lead provider. We hope that will be the case again but that is the discussion of the customer and our job is to make ourselves as attractive as possible to them.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then when you look at kind of midpoint of your fourth quarter guidance, the margins are little bit lower, previous expectations had them. I wonder if the biggest impact there is just increased cost structure from the acquisitions or is it the larger percentage of hardware in the business in the fourth quarter?", "Trac Pham", "It\u2019s a combination. This is Trac, Tom. It\u2019s a combination of few things, one is just the continued hiring in our business to the head count for the acquisitions and also traditionally Q4 is our historically the highest expensed quarter.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. All right. And finally you mentioned emulation in your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're doing well there. We are hearing that there is some pricing pressure in emulation these days. And just kind of curious what your view of the industry is right now and what your longer-term industry growth view is for emulation?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, I think emulation is interesting field because it has a natural growth just by virtue of the complexity of the circuits having grown immensely but also because the intersection of hardware and software demands just very fast, stimulation of various forms of application. And so in that context, I think that we've seen good growth in all of the EDA companies that provide these technologies.", "Now, when you use the word pricing pressure, you could have used it for last 30 years on any product in our field. The race is always on and so that the pricing pressure is mostly mitigated by saying well therefore, we have to develop better products that are more differentiated than that sort of manages the economic equation. So frankly nothing new under the sun and it applies to any field, be it hardware or software.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. You\u2019ve not seen any degradation of that market based on your litigation with Mentor Graphics?", "Aart de Geus", "No, none so far.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, I would like to ask first about the business impact of the two new markets that you highlighted as opportunities for you, namely automatic and IoT. And the question is two-fold. First, what do you think the relative benefit to your tools, IT and software integrity businesses might be from either of both of automotive and IoT? Do you think it would be mostly a tools play for you, an IT play or software integrity play?", "And similarly, how do you think one or both of these markets as they develop for you might change the services intensity or services profile of the company? When you look at your counterparts in engineering software for example that serve the automotive market, those engagements are often very services intensive. We know that Mentor\u2019s won some nice deals in automotive that are largely services oriented thus far. So if you or as you develop in automotive yourself and in IoT, you think there is going to be a significant ratcheting up of the kind of services you are going to have to provide and invest in?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Let me try to answer Part A, B, C and D of your question here. Maybe going backwards which is for starters. Overall initially these areas, the two focuses is bigger than either services or the software integrity just by virtue of -- these are markets that we have already interacted with quite a bit, only not necessarily in a vertical fashion. And so if we take automotive as an example, automotive has the characteristic that relatively speaking, they are not a super big EDA market but they are sophisticated EDA market not because they drive the state-of-the-art or FinFET for example, but because they have a stringent requirements, first and foremost for safety and then for reliability.", "When you think that that many of these products have to be in tiptop shape for 30 years, you can imagine that that\u2019s not a trivial task. And so increasingly with the growth of smarts in the cars, I can collect it that and therefore the increase of electronic content. One can see that therefore the attention on this type of conditions has to be higher. And so what we're doing in our tools and you heard in preamble in the IP, we are essentially making it conformant with the automotive standards that apply to the type of areas we touch, which are chip design and other companies may have other aspects.", "I cannot say that we see a lot of services there at the present time. But it\u2019s good you mentioned, we will think about it a bit more. On the IoT side of things, the IoT, unfortunately is a little bit of catch-on for the entire industry and Internet of Things, whatever the things are can lead to many different ways. I sometimes like to call it immensely optimized mystic thinking. And that is because right now many of the actual IoT parts are very low cost sensors connected to some data processing, quickly connecting it into the web where the monies made on the application.", "On the other hand, I do want to take my little optimistic thinking also in a positive direction, which is I think over time, this is really the root of where smarts will come about, because if all of these IoT devices can have a bit more computational capabilities at low power, over time one will see that they will have to work some degree of artificial intelligence, sounds like a big word. But adding smarts to many devices, which brings me to the software integrity aside because the other way to think about IoT and by the way in many ways cars as well, this is the intersection of hardware and software.", "And when you know that there are in advance cars, there is about a hundred million lines of code, as a minimum some shivers need to go down your spine because as you probably have read recently that code too has been hacked by now. And so aside of the traditional, safety and reliability constraints for automotive now security will be on par. And that is where of course our software integrity group will have impact. And the same is too for IoT.", "IoT are really hardware, software intersections where they touch the real world and then they create in many cases a lot of data and maybe some reasoning around it. And all of that has software quality and software security issues. So that is how these all ties together for us. It\u2019s early from a business size point of view but it\u2019s certainly very promising.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay. Thanks. And secondly, you said language to describe the guidance was certainly different. You talked about in future having a wider range of revenues, having to do with the variability of IT and hardware. Now those have been variable all along in anyway as we\u2019ve seen and your hardware business to date has sometimes had a good quarter but it's not on the whole have been a particularly large business for you. Has something changed, however, in terms of either market conditions or your competitiveness or both suggesting that over time your emulation business, particularly could be materially larger than it\u2019s been to date and hence the wider range of revenue outcomes?", "Aart de Geus", "So the reason why we increased the revenue guidance range is in fact driven by both, hardware and IP. On the hardware side as you\u2019ve seen year-to-date, we\u2019ve been doing very well progressively with hardware and that includes both, rapid prototyping and emulation. So, as that business continues to grow and becomes a more material part of our business, we would expect it to be more variable from quarter-to-quarter.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "All right. Lastly, as everyone knows from the last six quarters or so, you focused on ICC II of course and that's going to continue to be a major product event for you. The question is now that that\u2019s undelayable or stipulated or continue to be adopted of course, what\u2019s next on the tool side do you think as a next major driver to the business? If you set aside IT and the new software business, what else in let's say core EDA might also become a next good incremental way for you, not necessarily as large as implementation, but it might it be simulation or something else in verification? What do you think is next in terms of an incremental driver besides ICC II?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we actually do think that the other big investment that is now turning to seeing growth and return is actually the Verification Continuum. And the Verification Continuum is coming back because on one hand, it\u2019s many different tools that do get sold individually. But really the value that we are providing here is increasingly inability to use these tools with each other in a fashion that let them be adoptive -- adapted, sorry, adapted much better to the problem that people like to solve.", "And so in order to get there took quite a bit of effort, multiple of years extremely sophisticated programming. And in technical terms that means a common compilation platform meaning the description is understood in the same fraction. It also means a common debugging platform meaning that you can see and interpret and analyze your results in a user-friendly fashion.", "Those were very big investments. And they are now starting to bear fruit. At the very moment that another angle has started to increase in importance, which is this intersection between hardware and software. Are you there finding the hardware in the context of the software or you finding the software in the context of the hardware, or are you really verifying both simultaneously in order to get to market as fast as possible?", "And whichever is the long pool in the tent, you try to eliminate that one. And so that means that the spread that what one verifies is quite broad. Another area that we will see, we expect some good growth in the future is actually the custom area and this is an area that we have invested in for quite a while. We have a number of very new capabilities that we will be talking more about in the coming quarters. But these are all investments that invariably take many years and then when they rollout, the rollout itself is a major enterprise and that\u2019s what we are doing in verification right now.", "Operator", "We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Well, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Aart, in the [indiscernible], you were talking about like a 20% growth rate for that segment. Are you still seeing similar growth rates in that?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. We\u2019ve not changed our perspective on the opportunity space. Of course, since then the good news is I think we've learned a lot, including the fact that it's a space that is extremely fragmented with many loud voices and some that actually have impact on customers. And the fact that we have been able to close what we think are some very, very good acquisitions that have strengthened and broadened our position is a sign that we are, I think gaining confidence.", "No market is simple or easy, but I think it\u2019s rarely visible to most people that software has reached a stage where it needs the next level of -- I will use the word discipline and therefore the tools to enforce that. And by the time you throw the security in it, now you really have to start paying very systematic attention. And our objective is to provide the toolset that allows people to do that.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks. Then question on the Atrenta, maybe you can help us understand how to think about the impact on growth and margins from Atrenta\u2019s acquisition next year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, normally we don\u2019t breakout individual acquisitions of that size in terms of impact. Obviously, it will add revenue and as the haircut as you know, gradually goes away, it becomes rapidly less and less dilutive. It will be slightly dilutive in \u201916.", "But the reason always hesitant, frankly, to speak about that in those terms is, and the first think we do is to try to integrate tools into something bigger and better. And so, by the end of next year, I don't think that the Atrenta as we knew it quite exist. We have something better and that's actually mostly in the Verification Continuum.", "And so, we think it's actually fabulous technical acquisition and the customer loyalty and utilization has been very good and so this will also help us with a number of key customers as we look at the overall solution.", "Trac Pham", "I\u2019d add, even though, we stated earlier that collectively the acquisitions will be dilutive for next year. Our goal is still to drive EPS growth in the high-single digits.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Then last one for me. We have seen massive share buyback by one of your peers. Now you guys have a strong net cash position, generated lot of cash then why not accelerate the buyback?", "Trac Pham", "So, Monika, we think that the combination of buybacks and acquisitions definitely create a lot of value. We -- this particular quarter we happen to emphasize M&A, but overall early this year we did complete the -- we did announce the $180 million of ASR. And when you look back since 2010 to now, we\u2019ve bought back more than $1.1 billion of stocks, so we are very committed to that.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome, Monika.", "Operator", "At this time we have time for one more question. It will come from line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Yes. Thank you very much, Aart. Just sure if you can if you can talk a little bit about your strategy on the software security and quality market, you have been pretty active on that in terms of acquisitions? Are we going to see your growth strategy more focused on organic growth or you\u2019re going to be more aggressive on the acquisition side for this market?", "Aart de Geus", "Both an easy answer, yes. Meaning that the good news is we have a very, very good R&D team here. And it\u2019s quite remarkable how for the technology depth point of view and for many of the concept around calculation, understanding of languages, interpreting things, they are just as deep as the deepest people here at Synopsys and they have lot of similarity.", "At the same time, it is also very clear that if we invest in certain areas to broaden the impact they have. For example, with adding some more languages which we are doing, it immediately broadens the potential time of the solutions that we have.", "Having said that, the reason we invested in the security domain is because that\u2019s too is the domain of specialists. And specialist at times can be a two edge sword because they are sometime specialist that are very narrow problems, where it\u2019s very important to solve them, but it is very difficult to actually make a business off.", "And therefore, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I said that there are many essentially service companies in that space that\u2019s new -- if not a great job at least adequate job based on what is understood today.", "Our aim is slightly different. Our aim is to acquire or invest in areas where the problem is systematically growing and where we can offer much more of a platform solution, rather than either a service solution or some very low cost tools. And thus build the business not just similar to what EDA was in the early days for chip design, but now or for IP as a matter of fact, but now do the same in this domain, that is in our opinion still very much emerging.", "And so the acquisitions happen to be cornerstone pieces with very, very talented and experienced people, but that we\u2019re relatively small versus the opportunity space. And having the Synopsys machine and in some ways also the brand behind this gives an opportunity for these technologies to be leveraged much more. So I guess I sort of answered your question by not answering it, because we're doing really both.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And one more follow-up on the question Krish asked about the Intel talking about extending the development of the product and you answered. But I just want to simplify that a little bit and see if I understand that clearly. Is it fair to say that even if the technology rollout changes from two years to three years, is that the complexity has increased so much that the rate of consumption of EDA doesn't changes? Is that the right way to look at it?", "Aart de Geus", "That is exactly the right way to look at, because the way to look at it is, EDA and that includes all EDA companies, we\u2019re running as fast as we can at this point in time. And by the way I think the semiconductor, the manufacturing guys on technology, they\u2019re running as fast as they can and the users are adopting as fast as they can and as fast as is economically reasonable.", "And so the reason I make a distinction with the users is because economically reasonable is determined by one more variable, which is ultimately the production yield. And so of course, the manufacturers are trying to drive the yield up like crazy. We are trying to make the designs as yield friendly as possible, and the ultimate volume adoption is a function of that.", "But there is no question that, there is no change whatsoever in the speed of drive of the semiconductor industry, it\u2019s at max, it has always been at max and I think that will continue.", "Mahesh Sanganeria", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back for closing comments.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I guess that brings us to the turn of the hour. Thank you very much for a very interesting set of questions. And I hope that you have an impression of Synopsys that captures both the momentum and the opportunity space going forward. And we will be available for further questions in one-on-ones as usual. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Kerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC report and today's earnings press release.", "The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.", "All these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We are happy to report an excellent fourth quarter finish, wrapping up a strong fiscal year for Synopsys and providing a solid foundation as we enter 2016.", "During the year, we made excellent progress with the new generation of design and verification EDA tools, and are now in the midst of a multi-year product upgrade cycle. We also continued to invest in and grow our new Software Integrity products with several important acquisitions in the software quality and security space.", "Let me summarize our financial results for the quarter and year. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $587 million and $2.242 billion for the year, a 9% increase, reflecting both solid organic growth and important acquisitions.", "We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 in Q4, and 9.5% growth for the year to $2.77. Strong Q4 orders helped grow our three-year backlog to $3.6 billion. We generated approximately $495 million in operating cash flow and bought back $280 million in our stock, keeping share count flat.", "Building on our strong yearend position, we are setting a 2016 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.93 to $3, a revenue target of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion and an operating cash flow goal of at least $500 million. Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly.", "Several years ago, we embarked on a path to augment our leading silicon-enablement technology with a seamless connection to increasingly critical software elements and challenges. In 2015, we made excellent progress on our Silicon to Software vision. This vision and our execution put us at the right place, at precisely the right time, to help semiconductor and systems companies, as they transition to their next phase of growth.", "If you look back at history, the first phase in semiconductors was computation, driven by the PC; followed by mobility, driven by the smartphone; each of which prompting significant technology advances. We're currently seeing the beginnings of a third phase, aimed squarely at the next decade of the Internet of Things or what I prefer to call, Smart Everything.", "In Smart Everything, machine learning, image recognition and interpretation, reasoning and various other forms of artificial intelligence will impact every segment of the market. One remarkable example is in automotive, an industry that traditionally has only gradually adopted new technology, but is progressing by leaps and bounds from assisted to now autonomous driving.", "During these transition periods, we see some turbulence in the landscape, as many companies compete by refocusing their end-product differentiation, while others combine forces to ensure sufficient resources or market presence. In the last 18 months we've seen just that, with a large number of sizeable company consolidations contributing to analyst semi growth estimates of 2% for 2015 and 1% for 2016.", "In isolation, consolidations are a headwind for the EDA industry. However, they are also a hallmark of healthy restructuring in electronics, which drives major innovation from advanced silicon all the way up to software.", "Synopsys is well equipped, both technically and through our multi-year business model to navigate industry challenges. Our Silicon to Software center of gravity positions us well to again be a keystone provider in the next phase of the industry.", "Looking at 2016 and beyond, it's useful to assess how we're systematically evolving the company to deliver on this vision by focusing on four areas. First, develop and rollout the next generation of silicon design system capable of handling the most complex chips. Second, develop and rollout the highest performance verification solution for both the most complex chips, while addressing the intersection of hardware and software that is the very essence of modern electronic products.", "Third, grow in IP with a portfolio of building blocks, well suited for the next market of Smart Internet of Things devices. And fourth, grow in our new TAM of software quality and security, which addresses the needs of both software embedded in electronics and applications software in market segments as diverse as automotive, finance, health, energy and others.", "Let me report on our business from a product perspective in each area. In advanced design, we're tracking rapid adoption of 16, 14 and 10-nanometer FinFET technology. The cumulative number of active FinFET designs is approaching 260, a 50% increase in just one year.", "Synopsys is relied on for 95% of those chips, and 42 of the 43 leading-edge designs at 10-nanometer are using our design tools. Through our TCAD and OPC technology, we're also the go-to partner at 7 and 5-nanometer, collaborating with all top silicon providers as well as research consortia, such as IMEC.", "IC Compiler II is our cornerstone, next-generation physical design platform. Announced about 18 months ago, it saw a rapid, broad-based customer adoption during the year.", "In fact, it's the fastest-ramping product in our history, with now over 50 unique customers, active on 135 complex production designs, in 19 different process nodes. Its broad foundry certification enables continued momentum, and customers such as AMD, ARM, MediaTek, Renesas, SocioNext and Samsung have spoken publicly about their successes with IC Compiler II.", "Now, looking at verification. Complexity, not only exponentially grows with more sophisticated silicon, it greatly compounds with the amount of embedded software in all complex systems. This challenge, and thus opportunity for Synopsys, only increases as one foresees a decade of Smart Everything, with highly sophisticated hardware/software-optimized devices.", "We recognized this opportunity several years ago and accelerated R&D investments and M&A towards our Verification Continuum. Built around the fastest simulation, emulation and FPGA prototyping engine, our solution had an outstanding year of growth.", "A number of bellwether global companies have recently adopted our solution and we expect continued growth in FY '16. Specifically, we saw broad-based strength in emulation this year with technology that competitively leads in both performance and cost.", "In Q4, we shipped our new FPGA prototyping system, HAPS 80, with significantly faster performance. It enables customers to validate entire systems and accelerate software development by up to six to nine months.", "To further strengthen our Verification Continuum platform, in Q3 we acquired Atrenta, a leader in static and formal verification. The integration has gone quite well, and customers are very supportive of the combined product roadmap.", "Now, to our IP products, where we made good progress in expanding and optimizing our portfolio for IoT and key verticals, such as automotive. These application share many common building blocks, ranging from sensor connectors to embedded low-power processors and memories, to interfaces such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to the security blocks that enable built-in encryption.", "In September, we introduced a comprehensive IoT platform built around our very broad IP portfolio, including our sensor subsystem and low-power ARC processors. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we'll continue to deliver extensions to the platform over the next year.", "This year, we also launched an automotive-grade IP solution, which includes ISO-26262 pre-qualified IP for applications such as vehicle connectivity, infotainment and advanced driver-assistance systems. In addition, we closed two key acquisitions. We acquired Bluetooth IP from Silicon Vision and Elliptic Technologies, a leading provider of security IP and expertise. Both of these are critical building blocks for a broad set of IoT devices.", "Our leadership in FinFET-ready IP continues. During the quarter we announced 10-nanometer IP at TSMC and won at a premier customer in Asia for advanced FinFET design. As customers grow their IP relationships with us, more and more are opting for longer-term volume purchase agreements, rather than project-based buying. For us, this is positively skewing the business mix towards more time based rather than up-front revenue.", "And now to software quality and security, our early-stage, higher-growth business group that we call Software Integrity. As a backdrop, I spoke earlier about the mega-trend in the software industry, dealing with exploding amounts of complex software content. A second related trend is the continuous growth in the number of software developers. One source estimates 20 million developers today, growing to 25 million over the next five years.", "And third, the tools market for quality and security, which analysts estimate at about $2.4 billion, is growing at about 20% per year. Our products help developers write better, more secure code. This is done by testing for quality defects and security vulnerabilities to help eliminate flaws during the development process.", "Building on last year's acquisition of Coverity, 2015 was a year of operational integration and scaling, and broadening our presence in the security space. Coverity expanded Synopsys' customer base. Half of its business was with our existing customers, albeit different users, and half with companies we had never worked with before in the application software space.", "This past year we fully implemented our sales strategy. Assisted by software integrity experts, the existing worldwide Synopsys channel now serves semiconductor and systems customers. And we have a dedicated enterprise sales team focused on application software firms in areas such as finance and health, for example.", "Similar to how we built our EDA and IP businesses, our growth strategy features a combination of organic investment and acquisitions. During 2015, our organic investment focused on strengthening the sales structure and on broadening language coverage. With three recent acquisitions, we also significantly invested in the security space, expanding our TAM by about $900 million.", "Most notable was Codenomicon, a well-known expert in dynamic security testing and the co-discoverer of the infamous HeartBleed bug in 2014. Augmenting the security portfolio were the Seeker products, which find high-risk security weaknesses throughout the software development lifecycle. And in the last month, Protecode, which specializes in managing open-source and third-party source code.", "Finally, we are very pleased to welcome Howard Schmidt to our advisory team as Security Advisor. Howard is a noted cyber security expert, and former advisor to Presidents Obama and Bush. These investments will have a near-term, slightly dilutive impact, as we scale into this higher-growth space.", "For 2016, we have three primary strategic goals in software integrity. One, unify all the acquired technologies into a next-generation quality and security platform. Two, evolve and expand our focus on vertical segments. And three, address new opportunities in the compliance arena.", "For example, we started a collaboration with Underwriter's Laboratories on its Cybersecurity Assurance Program. It's designed to help companies manage security risks via a certification process, similar to what they have been doing for years for electrical hardware devices.", "From an overall company financial perspective, our primary long-term objective remains to drive high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings per share growth through a mix of the following. One, organically grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single-digit range. Two, organically grow revenue in IP systems and software solutions generally in the low double-digits.", "Three, actively explore TAM-expanding R&D and M&A opportunities. Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range. And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of M&A, stock buybacks and debt repayment.", "While the combination of elements may vary, based on business cycles and in-period priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent. In summary, we completed a very strong year against a somewhat turbulent industry backdrop. Our game-changing design and verification products have made great strides and are yielding excellent results.", "Our IP business continues to grow in sophistication and business breadth. And our drive towards the new TAM of software quality and security is rapidly establishing Synopsys as a key player in this emerging market.", "With that, let me pass the mic to Trac for the financial perspective.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. As Aart mentioned, we delivered a strong finish to an outstanding year and continued to demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.", "We generated 9% revenue and 9.5% non-GAAP earnings growth, and $495 million in operating cash flow. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog and returned $280 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. Simultaneously, we continue to make internal investments and acquire key technology to drive long-term growth.", "Despite a challenging semiconductor environment, we continue to execute very well and enter 2016 with a solid financial foundation. Our outlook reflects another year of increased growth and profitability and strong cash flow. In addition, our stable and predictable business model allows us time to respond, if the environment becomes more challenging.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q4 2015 results and 2016 targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.", "We closed another excellent quarter and achieved strong 2015 results. We delivered total revenue of $587 million in Q4 and $2.242 billion for the year. We significantly exceeded our original 2015 target, primarily as a result of solid organic growth.", "Revenue growth was strong across all product platforms, with particular strength in place and route and emulation, and across all geographies, except for Japan, which was affected by the yen. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of both Q4 and 2015 revenue.", "The weighted average duration of the renewable customer license commitment was about 2.9 years for the quarter and about 2.7 years for 2015. We expect weighted average duration for 2016 to be approximately 2.7 years.", "Our three-year backlog increased to $3.6 billion from $3.5 billion, due to the timing of large contract renewals, business growth and acquisitions. We have approximately 80% of the 2016 revenue target already in hand, which provides us a good measure of stability and predictability.", "Turning to expenses. Total GAAP cost and expenses were $530 million for the quarter and $1.98 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $464 million for the quarter and $1.72 billion for the year. The annual increase was due to higher costs associated with employee compensation, planned hiring, acquisitions and cost of goods sold for emulation sales.", "We delivered very solid non-GAAP operating margins, 21% for the quarter and 23.4% for the year. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by approximately 70 basis points over 2015 levels. We'll continue to drive company-wide operational discipline in order to fund our higher-growth initiatives, with an ongoing goal to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range.", "Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter and $1.43 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Full year non-GAAP earnings grew 9.5% to $2.77. We were able to largely offset the dilution from acquisitions through strong operational execution.", "Cash flows were excellent and above guidance, due to strong business levels and collections. We delivered $152 million in operating cash flow in Q4 and $495 million for the year, despite the impact of outflows related to acquisitions. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $965 million, with 16% onshore and total debt of $205 million.", "In 2015, we repurchased 6 million shares of stock for $280 million. This was roughly 70% of the annual free cash flow. 1.7 million shares were delivered in Q4, as part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase plan that was set up in August. The ASR was completed in November, when the final 377,000 shares were delivered.", "In September, the Board replenished our share repurchase authorization to $500 million. We plan to return more cash to shareholders in 2016 by increasing our buybacks to slightly reduce the share count.", "We expect operating cash flow to be at least $500 million in 2016. The quarterly profile will be similar to prior years, with a net outflow during Q1. This is due largely to the payout of the prior year's annual incentive compensation.", "DSO was 60 days, reflecting strong business levels. We ended Q4 with 10,280 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies. The increase in the number of employees was due to recent acquisitions, along with planned hiring.", "Now to the first quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the first quarter, the targets are: revenue between $560 million and $575 million, as we communicated in August, we expect increased variability in quarterly revenue due to lumpiness of hardware and consulting revenue.", "Total GAAP cost and expenses between $505 million and $524 million; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $445 million and $455 million; other income between 0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $0.25 to $0.33 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.63 per share.", "For fiscal 2016: revenue of $2.350 billion to $2.390 billion, which reflects roughly a 1 percentage point headwind impact from the yen; other income between 0 and $4 million; beginning in 2016, we've adopted a normalized annual non-GAAP tax rate, which is the norm for our industry, we'll continue to use a tax rate of 19% through 2018, we'll monitor the rate for any significant events that could materially affect it.", "Outstanding shares between 155 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $1.55 to $1.71 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $101 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 to $3 per share; capital expenditures flat with 2015 at approximately $90 million; and cash flow from operations of at least $500 million.", "To help in your modeling, we expect second half revenue to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter. Total non-GAAP expenses to skew slightly toward the first half of the year. And second half non-GAAP EPS to be moderately higher than the first half, with Q1 the lowest EPS quarter. We are also reiterating our multi-year goal of high-single digit non-GAAP EPS growth.", "In summary, even in the context of a challenging semiconductor environment, we're delivering very good results. Our 2016 outlook reflects solid growth in revenue and profitability and strong cash flow. Our healthy cash position, conservative business model, and excellent backlog provide a stable financial foundation for this year and beyond. And our focus remains centered on managing the business to maximize shareholder value.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company.", "Rich Valera", "Aart, as I'm sure you're aware, most of the large semi deals that have been announced have not yet closed, so presumably there could be some increased EDA headwinds as those deals closed and deals renew. Can you say what if any allowance that you've baked into your guidance to sort of allow for that potential pressure as those deals close and the contracts renew?", "Aart de Geus", "We think we have fully allowed for that in the sense that in my preamble I think I may have used the word, being prudent under the circumstances. And that's exactly what it meant, is understanding that these shifts are occurring, have occurred, but also understanding that we are actually quite well-positioned in those, meaning that in a number of situations customers, when they combine, they rethink where they want to go with their tools. And we think how they can be more efficient and more often than not they also select the better solution.", "And I hope that we can say that we have that solution in those cases. So from a guidance point of view, we obviously are well aware of this picture. And have tried to bake in our best estimation of what is likely to happen.", "Rich Valera", "And it sounds like you had a strong year with emulation. And I take it that means you didn't see any significant pause in that business in the fourth quarter, is that accurate, Aart?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. I don't think that we saw any change in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. When we look at emulation, we look immediately at our overall verification continuum. And I think at this point in time, we have a value proposition that is really exciting, because all the sub-pieces are very good. And now we are starting to see the leverage between the different products and aspects of the solution. And the fourth quarter, in general, was maybe slightly surprisingly strong quarter for us, and I think bodes well for the next year.", "Rich Valera", "So you feel pretty good about the growth prospects of your hardware business, the emulation and the FPGA prototyping, is that a fair statement?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. And there is a reason for that, which is that the entire industry, and what I mean with that is both the semiconductor side as well as the systems side is really focused and centered now on providing value that sits at this intersection of hardware and software. And you say what does the software have to do with these EDA tools. Well, it has to do a lot, because what people would like to do is to try out their software on the hardware before it's built.", "And in that context, that require super-fast simulation and debugging, and emulation and FPGA-based prototyping sits right in the middle of that. And so I think this is a very big trend that is going to be positive for the entire EDA industry.", "Rich Valera", "And just one more to clarify. Did you say in the prepared remarks, I think this was Trac, actually, that you expected to do a greater dollar amount of share repurchase in fiscal '16 versus fiscal '15?", "Trac Pham", "That's right, Rich. We did $280 million in '15 and we expect to do more than that in order to reduce the share count slightly to the range of 155 to 158 for '16.", "Operator", "And now to the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America.", "Krish Sankar", "I had a couple of them, Aart, just to follow-up on the M&A question. Even though some of these M&A deals have not closed, have you seen a change in the behavior from the EDA purchasing managers at semi companies, anticipating the potential M&A, are they scaling back EDA purchases?", "Aart de Geus", "That reaction happens about 10 minutes after the deal was announced. Meaning that, within companies that are contemplating mergers, every employee in those companies ask themselves, so what about me and what happens next, and how do you align the company and so on.", "Now, there's a whole set of restrictions in terms of what they can do between companies that have announced mergers and have not merged yet. But there is clearly a large amount of planning that goes on in parallel to the process of seeking the various national approvals, and in that process they look at where their future will lie. It is certainly true that in practice the actions occur really only once their mergers are closed, but the thinking proceeds that.", "Krish Sankar", "And then I think in your prepared comments you kind of said that, one of the goals is to have like a low-to-mid single-digits kind of a core organic EDA growth rate. That seems like a shift from like prior growth rate expectations. I'm just kind of curious, if semi M&A is impacting EDA in the long run, at least being a headwind in the near-term, do you still need to have a 32% kind of a R&D as a percentage of sales given the fact that even if Moore's law are slowing and companies are consolidating, is there room to actually bring that R&D down, because it seems like pretty high run rate?", "Aart de Geus", "It's an excellent question, because whenever there are major shifts in the industry or the makeup of the industry, the characteristics of differentiation may evolve. What is clear, and by the way I think, very exciting, is that from a silicon perspective, we can see the next 10 years still cruising forward rapidly in terms of complexity.", "What this does is that it provides the computational platform that will make a whole different phase of software possible, and so from that perspective, yes, you may say, our R&D is high, but it's always been sort of at that level, because for literally 29 years of our existence, we have driven the state-of-the-art of Moore's law. And from a technical point of you, there is no slowdown. If nothing else, there is an acceleration because it's multiplied by the software side of things.", "Now, we do look at presently being in somewhat of a phase shift in the semiconductor industry as a number of companies look at these opportunities, invest, and reconfigure themselves towards them. I think we are already well-moved in that direction. And hopefully I was able to communicate a little bit the notion of the vision that we've had now for a number of years of silicon to software as really moving the center of gravity exactly where the customers are going to be in the next few years. And so notwithstanding, the normal turbulence, whenever you have new opportunities emerging, but not yet having big economic impact, I think we're very well-positioned for that.", "Krish Sankar", "And then just a final question from my end, Aart. If you look at the backlog growth, which is probably like 2 or 3 percentage year-over-year, it looks like bookings might have declined on an annual basis. Where was the biggest weakness you saw on the bookings?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, the challenge with looking at bookings when you have a business profile that has a majority of the deals that are only averaged about round numbers three years, if some of the larger deals fall in a certain year, the backlog will grow, in other years it may actually shrink. And so maybe more relevant to your question, therefore, two other points, one is that the run rate continue to grow for us, but secondly, that we're entering again a year with essentially 80% of the revenue in hand. And so when we look at the backlog, the real main value of that is degree of stability that allows us to continue to invest precisely in turbulent times, so that as the economic opportunities come out, we're ready to grow with them.", "Operator", "And now to the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Let's actually follow that line of thinking, because that was actually one of my questions, but also shouldn't that sort of factors that are in that backlog that impact that calculated bookings growth won the timing of your largest customer and when that renewed? And how that impacts your calculation, as well as any contributions to the backlog from acquisitions? And if you could actually give us any additional color on what the acquisition contributions to the backlog last year and this year, that would certainly be helpful to understand the [multiple speakers].", "Aart de Geus", "Sure, actually, I think you're making exactly the point that I intended to make, which is that, there is a variability from year-to-year depending on not just one, but some of the larger customers. And most large customers don't have just single contracts, they have multiple contracts. So it's actually in practice more complicated.", "Let's say, for arguments sake, if we had only one customer and that customer renewed every three years, while you would have every three years a big backlog increase and the next two years a big decrease. Obviously, that's an extreme case, but if you look at the universe of our customers, there is variability depending on where the bulk of the renewals fall.", "And sometimes these timelines change as a function of us having different tools that we engage. We have new products or customers have changed circumstances such as consolidations, so we're managing a dynamic set of relationships, but fundamentally our duration, I don't know, the average number is maybe about 2.7 years or 2.8 years or so, and so that has been remarkably confident.", "Sterling Auty", "So if I'm look at the guidance on revenue and the growth either at the midpoint or even at the high-end of the guidance range, it still seems to imply some deceleration, even though you've got Atrenta in there for a full year, how should I think about where the biggest parts of that deceleration is coming from? Is that factoring in the M&A headwinds and a slowdown in EDA? Is that some sort of normalization to the higher growth parts of the portfolio? How do you kind of connect those dots?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, I think the first point is actually more fundamental, which is if you look at the semiconductor industry, its own growth rate is somewhat anemic right now. And in all fairness, this can go up and down by 5% without anybody being able to predict it. That's just the normal noise in that industry. But against that backdrop customers are cautious. And it's also against that backdrop that consolidation manifests itself. And as I mentioned in a previous answer, I think we have a very good understanding of the potential impact of consolidation and we've taken a prudent approach to it.", "The other thing I am reminded of is that there is about a 1% impact of the yen, but in all fairness, I always discount these things a little bit. Now because they're not right, it's just that, it feels like somewhat simplistic comment, when the reality is, hey, we're hustling for business and that's how we should grow the company.", "Lastly, I do think that there is no question that our largest market is the one that's most impacted by semiconductors, but we continue to invest in these new areas I think with quite good success. And so in that sense, our product portfolio I think is evolving well. And that's precisely, what one should do in these phase shift on an industry.", "Sterling Auty", "And then last question, can you give us a sense, you gave us some statistics around IC Compiler II. I don't know if there's a way for you to qualify or to measure, but what perhaps the win rate in terms of IC Compiler II adoption in situations where you saw side-by-side RFPs, bake-offs, tasks, however, you want to describe it just to see how the tool and those heads-up competitions actually fared during the quarter?", "Aart de Geus", "So there are a lot of head-to-head competitions largely because the industry is very engaged in both looking forward, from a technology point of view, while simultaneously becoming or being very cost conscious. I don't think that in general this is not quite a zero sum game. And a number of customers use tools from multiple vendors, partially to quote, keep us honest, which I never quite like as a terminology, but I can sympathize with their desire to make sure that we stay on the ball, and partially because they want to negotiate on price.", "Having said that our product is technically doing extremely well and this year was really the year where we were almost overwhelmed by the number of customers that adopted us on a product that is now rapidly gaining in solidity, as it gets applied to more and more extremely, extremely complex shifts.", "And what is exciting about that is that many of the capabilities that this was built for are precisely the capabilities that are now being exercised. And I'm talking here about 10-nanometer, and in the beginning it was 7-nanometer design. And so we expect that the benefits of the products are now becoming rapidly more and more visible. And so far I think from a market share point of view, we've done quite well.", "Operator", "And now, to the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson.", "Tom Diffely", "The first question on the balance sheet. You mentioned that only 16% of your cash was onshore. You're going to increase your share repurchasing and I guess ongoing M&A. So I guess a couple of questions here. First, what is the cost to repatriate some of your cash that's offshore? And then of the $500 million cash generation this or in the coming year, how much of that is expected to be onshore?", "Trac Pham", "So let me take the first question. So the simplest answer is any cash that you patriate through U.S. will be taxed at the 35%-plus rate. The intent is, we would obviously look at debts and find a way to manage that effectively. Second part is when we look at the $500 million cash from operations for next year, it should be similar to the mix that we've had in the past, which is about 50-50 U.S. versus non-U.S.", "Tom Diffely", "When you look at the potential acquisition targets out there, are they predominantly in the U.S. or is there a pretty good international mix?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the international mix is growing. And actually if you look at some of the acquisitions we did in the security domain, albeit that they were relatively small companies, they're literally a bit all over the map, because software is being developed in a much more distributed fashion in the world than silicon or chip design.", "And so that is an interesting perspective, because that also says that our TAM is much more global from a software point of view. And we never really looked hard at doing business in Australia, I guess now we are in Australia. And at least there is sufficient software opportunity is there to warrant having a presence, whereas from a hardware design point of view, that's a very, very, very little.", "So these profiles changes as a company. And I think four out of seven deals this year were offshore. But the reality is we have a balance sheet that we have structured on purpose to be flexible enough, so that if there are great opportunities, we will not hesitate to do them wherever they are.", "Tom Diffely", "And it sounds like the 2016 will be another year of investment for the software security space. Should we expect operating expenses to go up in this space or maybe just to shift over from some of the core EDA into software? How do you view the drawbacks as it goes through the year with the ramping software security business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, our hope, of course, is to continue to grow well the software integrity business, and so far, so good. I think we are very happy that we invested in this area. It's actually very complex area. And we are seeing that many of the things that we've learned over literally decades in the hardware world do apply in the software world in terms of building a platform of tools that is very sophisticated.", "And so from that perspective, we will continue to push on investing in this area as long as we see really good growth. We will and are gradually improving the profitability of the business, but if I had to push on priority growth versus profitability, I'd go from a growth any day, because we know that in a new market you can drive the profitability overtime. Having said that, just to make sure everybody understands, we do believe that, the notion of a business means that you're profitable overtime, and so we're heading there. And the acquisitions we did where really only very marginally dilutive since all these things get up sort of very quickly.", "Trac Pham", "I would add that these investments are done in the context of us also expecting to drive off margins up this year in 2016. When you look at the EPS guidance that we provided, at the midpoint we should be looking to increase operating margins by about 70 basis points versus 2015. So these investments are important, but we're going to manage it, strike the right balance between growth and profitability.", "Tom Diffely", "And then finally, when you look at the customer consolidation overtime, say over the next few years, is your view that the number of engineers in the world continues to grow? Are you seeing kind of plateauing of engineers that ultimately drive the seats that drive your business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, so our past experience has been that certainly in the electronics domain, the number of engineers has certainly not shrunk. It may have grown actually quite a bit in the development countries that initially had good engineers, but not the same level of productivity. I think that the second comment I would make is I think that the notion of engineer is evolving, because if you buy into the picture that I painted of a really an intersection between hardware and software, that's much more optimized for the end application.", "You will see that the value of engineers that are having sort of 1 foot in each cap will grow. And we see that in our own company having a number of people that have visibility precisely because we developed a new generation of tools and systems to deal with that. And then on the software side, there is no question that the number of engineers -- they don't call themselves necessarily engineers, they call themselves software developers, but it's fundamentally an engineering schooling and that number is still growing rapidly.", "Operator", "And now to the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark.", "Gary Mobley", "I wanted to start out by asking a question about the core EDA business. Could you give us a sense, and it doesn't have to be precise because I'm sure you don't have it at your fingertips, a sense of the mix between systems OEMs and pure merchant chip companies? And can you give us some sense of how the systems OEMs licensing activity has trended may be relative to historical trends or relative to the merchant chip vendors?", "Aart de Geus", "We actually do have that sort of at our fingertips. And I say, sort of, because the notion of semiconductor and systems, there is a whole bunch of companies that are sort of in the middle of that. But for many years, Synopsys has had about 40% of its revenue coming from what one would call, system companies, meaning companies that are closer to end product versus semiconductor companies that are closer to the physical manufacturing of chips.", "And I don't think it will change all that much. There are a few more companies that used to do manufacturing that are now relying on foundries to get there. But it's really a spectrum. And 3precisely, because it's the spectrum, it's useful to understand what new system companies do more often than semiconductor people.", "And of course, you arrive again at this word of software, meaning that for them a lot of their differentiation is how their software performs certain end tasks. And increasingly these end tasks will be optimized by dedicating hardware to the specific nature of that task. And so it's in that context that you're asking a good question because we're connecting well with that part of the world. And more rapidly, maybe then even we had expected people are using our verification tools to check out the software, while the hardware is still in development.", "Gary Mobley", "Just one follow-up question. If I'm not mistaken, we're targeting about $80 million in sales from the Coverity business, and perhaps targeting roughly $100 million for fiscal year '16. Did we, in fact, finish somewhere around the $80 million mark for the fiscal year? And are you still looking at roughly 25% growth for 2016?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think we have communicated, when we acquired it that we would pass the $100 million in '16. I think we're well on track for that. We don't disclose the intermediary numbers. But as said, I think the prediction that we had made to them, which was we granted significantly less knowledge still appears to be right on.", "Operator", "And now, to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Trac, I was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how you went about allowing for the possible effects of semiconductors consolidation. We, for our part, for example, have calculated that the pre-merger EDA budgets of the companies known so far to be merging with the exception of Intel keep their budget aside is somewhere between 5% and 10% of total EDA industry revenue.", "And even if you haircut that, as you have to, that would still amount to a relatively small percent of total EDA spent and it's probably not going to be affecting the vendors according to the market share. In other words, it's likely to be some unequal effects on the vendor. So anyway, I just wondered, if you could talk about how you're actually went about haircutting and thinking through the pre-merger to post-merger budgets of the companies involved?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I'm glad you did this exercise. Because we do this exercise every day, right. And so this is part of running the company. And without going into the specifics of any of these companies, fundamentally what you did is the right type of calculation. I would make sure though that as much as there is a lot of talk about consolidation, we should really look at the macro numbers on semiconductors, which is really the growth rate of semiconductors.", "And while that growth rate itself does not impact EDA all that much from year-to-year, for the simple reasons that, A, we are much more tied to the R&D budget and those don't change so fast; and B, we have multi-year agreements, so in that sense, we feather through the up and downs of the industry. Nonetheless, I think that is a bigger factor of the consolidation itself how the two relate.", "And so we did essentially an exercise multiple times like you did and then the question is, okay, at any individual situation, how does it play out? And we will put our best foot forward in those. Given that the number of those this year was clearly higher than what we've seen in the past, so we decided to be prudent in the guidance. But I think that we are clearly out executing significantly our host industry. And from that perspective, I think we are going to be able to continue to invest to be well-positioned as it finds its next wave of growth.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Just a follow-up on the consolidation thing and then a change of subject. With respect to the transfer of licenses, one company gets merged into another, is there uniformity in the terms and conditions affecting the transfer of licenses and whether or not the acquired company or the surviving company needs to re-acquire or re-contract for those licenses? Is there some uniformed method to that? And similarly, this is somewhat speculated, but is there any reason to believe that companies customers not involved in merging might somehow also changed their behavior that they see all the budgetary fund that the emerging companies are having and they might want to have some to?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, you know every company, every customer at all points in time is always trying to see if they can get more value at lower cost, and nothing wrong with that. We have always been successful in providing lower costs, but also providing so much more value that we have continued to grow as a company and as a matter of fact as an industry. And so I think that will continue. The transactions or the contracts that we have with customers are non-cancellable, but at the same time, we all want to have long-term good relationships with our customers. And so when changes happen, one will discuss that with them.", "And the last comment I would make is that all the contracts they are like phonebook thickness complexity because there are so many different variables and conditions and so on, because these are typically very large deals, and so from that perspective there is a certain degree of built-in stability. And I think that's stability is especially when you have a well-structured multiyear set of agreements is precisely what has allowed us to do really well in any of the more turbulent phases of the industry over the years. And so I think we know well how to behave in such phase.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Lastly, at the Design Automation Conference back in June during the investor meeting you hosted with analysts, there were some discussion about some price changes that you've had made with respect, for example, to verification and place and route in terms of your core-based pricing, that's essentially a price increase, if I remember correctly. Could you talk about the effect of that change of pricing on your '15 results? And how are you thinking about pricing going into '16 and beyond?", "Aart de Geus", "I am a bit embarrassed to say that I'm drawing a blank about that discussion. Generically speaking, we typically increase the prices of our products, when there is a major shift in additional value that's been provided. And so, for example, the move from our IC compiler I to IC Compiler II is on a very different price base. And then we have all kinds of discounts and arrangements in volume situations. And it's a function of a number of cores it's run into. So it's actually a fairly complex set of calculations.", "But at the end of the day, it's what I tried to mention earlier, which is, customers will drive on costs, we will drive on value and let the two meet at a place that lets us go. And so far so good and I look forward at this coming year in terms of Synopsys really delivering a lot of incremental value. And so as customers will need these capabilities, I think we have an opportunity to continue to do very well.", "Operator", "And now to the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest.", "Monika Garg", "The first is on the cash flow guidance. Cash flow operation, guidance is flattish year-over-year. And especially given last year, you had one-time charges, one to retirement and acquisition-related charges. So the question is kind of is the number conservative or otherwise why it's kind of flattish number?", "Aart de Geus", "So Monika, I would say that we're approaching the cash flow outlook similar to how we're guiding on revenues. We're taking a prudent approach to it. It's early in the year, and as you know, the cash flow is driven a lot by the bookings and the business levels. And so we'll continue to update that throughout the year as we get better visibility. But it's consistent with how we're looking at the rest of the business.", "Monika Garg", "Then on the IP systems and software quarter revenue, it seems both for Q3 and Q4, it is flattish year-over-year. Now, given the Coverity is growing, you require some assets in software security market. Could you help reconcile these numbers?", "Trac Pham", "Sure. I would look at the annualized growth rate and look at over a multi-year period, when you look at their IP business and as we evaluate our IP business, we still believe it's a low-double digit growth opportunity. And the overall market continues to be very healthy. Our business, we feel very confident in. And so over a multi-year period, that should still be the model. You will see it vary from quarter-to-quarter or even occasionally year-to-year, depending on the timing of the percentage of completion for IP consulting. But we still think that the model of a low-double digit for IP is the appropriate one.", "Monika Garg", "And then on the Coverity. Is Coverity expected to be breakeven and then second half accretive? I think that's was the kind of guidance you provided last quarter?", "Aart de Geus", "As we mentioned it in the Q3 earnings call that it was going to be slightly dilutive in the second half. Originally, when we first purchased Coverity, we thought it would breakeven. And we, frankly, at the levels that we're operating at, we certainly could have gotten to that level. But given the opportunity to invest in some of the languages, we thought it would be a better investment to allow to be slightly dilutive in the second half in order to drive the growth.", "Monika Garg", "So still expected to be dilutive in second half 2016?", "Trac Pham", "I'm sorry. You're asking about '16. For '16 we're certainly going to exceed the original guidance of over $100 million. And that will be slightly dilutive, given the acquisitions that we made in the second half of '15. Keep in mind, this is in the context of us expanding margins from '15 to '16.", "Monika Garg", "Then the last question so, on the consolidation again, Aart. You kind of talked about you targeting low-to-mid single-digit organic or EDA growth. How much do you think is impact of consolidation in that number, like 1% to 2%? Would you be able to quantify that?", "Aart de Geus", "I think you should give Jay a call. He did the computations in detail here. We don't want to go into the specific, because each one of these situations is different and they haven't played out. And as one of other callers correctly said was, many of these things have been announced, but are not closed, and so the impact in timing can still be very far away. Having said that, it's just we have looked at this head on, and actually see in a number of situation some opportunities. It's just that you can't count on them, until they come home to roost. But it is not as dramatic as it sound.", "Operator", "And now to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.", "Xiao Yuan", "This is Xiao Yuan for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my questions. So Aart, there are a lot of questions on this consolidation. And I'm sorry, I have to ask one more. So on the synergy perspective it kind of makes sense for two companies to move to one unified design platform after the merger. I guess, questions, one, do you think there will be any market share shift, as the main deals are getting closed. I guess maybe the impact will not be immediate. But what do you see in the next two to three years? And then, two, given that background what is your expectation of Synopsys' core EDA growth rate in relation to the market?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in relationship to the market, we think that we can do better than the market, which is another way of saying that we think that there is an opportunity for us to gain share. At the same time, there is some degree of headwind by virtue of the customers fundamentally wanting to do this, to pay less, not more.", "And so in that context, I do think that we have a great opportunity for Synopsys, because: a, we are well-positioned for all the technologies that these very companies aspire to be good at; b, we're well-positioned to also now reach into the domain that they were less in, which is everything that touches their differentiation through hardware and software.", "And lastly, we are very well equipped to continue with a really good support at the very moment, where they will definitely need some help on the advanced chips and while integrating their companies. And so I think we are not only a safe bet for the technology leadership bet, and that's a good position to be in, in situations like this.", "Xiao Yuan", "And then, one more question, on the Q1 revenue guidance the midpoint is down about 3.5 percentage point. I understand there is lumpiness in the business because of verification. One of their competitors is shipping their new emulators right now. Are you seeing any impact from that from any changes in market?", "Aart de Geus", "No. We don't see any impact of that. The emulation market is actually a very broad one. There is opportunities to grow, just because that as a market segment is I think doing quite well. And typically, when people introduce something, there may be sometime where customers want to look at the new product, whatever it is.", "In our case, the characteristics of our product are very well known, specifically the super-high speed and low cost per gate is a key differentiator. So for the people that are focused on those type of angles, we have seen no impact by anybody's announcement.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have no more questions in queue. Please continue.", "End of Q&A", "Aart de Geus", "Well, thank you so much for attending this call, and thank you also very much for supporting and being interested in us for all of FY '15. I think we delivered on the mark versus where we set our guidance a year ago, actually I think a little bit better or quite a bit better than the numbers we had in mind then. We'll, of course, try to do the same in '16, and we hope that you will be part of the team following us at that time.", "For those of you that have additional questions, as usual, the small crew here will be available for calls after this earnings release. Thank you very much. And have hopefully a good vacation break at the end of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ", "At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC report and today's earnings press release.", "The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplements that we released earlier today. All of these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on this site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered revenue of $569 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68. We entered into a $200 million accelerated share buyback program and are well on-track to meeting our revenue, EPS, and operating cash flow objectives for the year.", "Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly. As most of you know well, Synopsys serves the broad Electronics industry all the way from Silicon to Software. Over the past five years this market has seen, and is seeing, dramatic changes as continued advances bring daunting complexity challenges, but also a fabulous wave of impact and business ", "opportunities. ", "Most notably, demand is expanding for mobile and cloud infrastructure to support the enormous potential of big data, which is accelerated by a wave of Internet of Things data generation. Internet of things, or IoT for short, itself is rapidly morphing into the next generation of smart everything meaning digitally intelligent devices using functions such as vision, learning, and reasoning, as we\u2019re already seeing in assisted and autonomous driving.", "The increase in complexity of these sophisticated hardware/software systems challenges the entire value chain. Whereas the race is on again along the traditional metrics of performance, power and cost, it\u2019s also subject to growing concerns on how to deal effectively with systemic security issues. ", "Synopsys is uniquely focused on enabling our customers across three market segments:", "Semiconductor companies, who design chips and increasingly embed software in them; ", "Systems companies, who develop products that incorporate chips while adding their own differentiating software; and Software developers across many industry segments, who focus on handling the increasing complexity and security of their code.", "For Synopsys, \u201ccomplexity\u201d is in our DNA and we\u2019re well equipped to enable the next generation of opportunities. Many years of investments have made us the market and technology leader in EDA; the second largest IP company in the world; and the emerging front-runner in addressing the critical new software quality and security space. ", "We\u2019re consciously building our Silicon to Software market position with an objective to grow shareholder value through strong operating cash flow generation, solid revenue growth and expanding annual non-GAAP operating margins through a balanced capital allocation strategy featuring stock buybacks to maintain or shrink share count. And acquisitions to expand our SAM and TAM and through the most predictable recurring, time-based revenue model in the industry, supported by a large multi-year backlog.", "Our objective thus remains to drive long-term revenue and earnings growth, while continually evolving the position of Synopsys towards the sweet spot of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s electronics. Let me make a couple comments on the present landscape. In Semiconductors, the environment is essentially unchanged since we spoke in December. ", "While consolidations are a bit of a headwind for the EDA industry, as customers rationalize their combined businesses over time, Synopsys is faring quite well in these situations. ", "The mission critical nature and completeness of our solutions mitigate risks and our Q1 results are very encouraging. In Systems, our strong position and focus on the intersection of hardware and software have been particularly positive, and we\u2019re seeing growth for Synopsys. For software developers, our rapidly evolving platform of quality and security solutions is getting attention, and we see increased calls to action, most notably from the security perspective.", "Now to some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. In Q1 we signed a significant agreement with Globalfoundries for design, verification and manufacturing tools. Synopsys is supporting their recently acquired IBM ASIC business by providing access to a full Synopsys flow, including IC Compiler II place and route and IC Validator physical verification. ", "In addition, a cornerstone memory supplier increased its business with us by more than 25% per year, with particular strength in analog simulation and manufacturing. Meanwhile, our next-generation physical design system, IC Compiler II, continues its rapid deployment as customers see excellent results. The solution is production proven, with nearly 150 production designs supporting 19 different silicon process nodes. ", "Demand is quite high as IC Compiler II continues the fastest ramp of the Synopsys product ever, with opportunity for further growth. Some visible successes include: November\u2019s qualification of IC Compiler II by Samsung Foundry for its 10nm production work. A collaboration with Globalfoundries on the industry\u2019s first 22nm FD-SOI process and reference flow that includes Synopsys synthesis, IC Compiler II, and signoff.", "As the clear leader in advanced design tools, we are witnessing increased adoption of 16, 14, 10 and even 7nm FinFET technology. Of the 286 active FinFET designs currently being tracked, Synopsys is relied on for 95% of those chips. 100% of the 10nm and 7nm tape-outs completed thus far utilized Synopsys design tools.", "Notable also is Samsung already providing 10nm qualified Synopsys physical verification run-sets. IC Validator, which works particularly well with IC Compiler II and on FinFET technologies, is seeing an increase in customer utilizing its full signoff status. We also experienced strong growth and business alignment this quarter with multiple silicon manufacturing partners in both lithography and TCAD at very advanced nodes.", "Now to verification, an area where we\u2019ve seen excellent growth as our vision is now being realized. A number of years ago, we recognized that existing verification approaches were woefully inadequate to deal with the upcoming complexity growth in hardware, and the systemic challenges of hardware and software.", "We had a vision, anchored around our market-and technology leading VCS simulation, to ", "deliver a complete platform of interacting verification techniques which we called the Verification Continuum. This vision and its subsequent execution were right-on, and today we\u2019re seeing excellent technical results, as well as business and market share growth.", "A great example in Q1 was a major enterprise-level partnership and expanded commitment to Synopsys by one of the top mobile semiconductor companies, to drive state-of-the-art technology collaboration and broadened adoption of our solution. Both the hardware and software elements of our Verification Continuum did well this quarter.", "Our emulation system, ZeBu, saw excellent growth and continues to demonstrate performance and cost advantages. In prototyping, we shipped a large number of our next-generation HAPS FPGA based systems. On the software side, our virtual prototyping solution is having solid success, particularly in the auto industry. As evidenced by a large Q1 agreement with a leading U.S. OEM, our automotive strategy is bearing fruit as the industry is massively increasing its investments towards opportunities such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.", "We expect the verification business to do well this year. Now to our IP products, where a solid results quarter accompanied continued expansion of our already broad portfolio. Our distinct leadership in interface IP continues. This quarter we were first to market with the new USB Type C, which supports the connector that functions with either side up or down. ", "In Q1, we also announced our Data Fusion Subsystem for IoT devices. The many sensors on cell phones, tablets, and the like need to take data in and process it effectively. This first-of-its-kind integrated subsystem bringing together the processors, peripherals, memories, libraries and drivers necessary makes it easier, quicker, and lower risk for customers to build this functionality into their chips.", "We also continue to innovate in our security IP portfolio. This quarter, we announced an enhanced security package, featuring data encryption, address scrambling, and data integrity checks aimed at providing protection from system attacks and IP theft. The theme of security naturally brings me to our Software Integrity business group. This new TAM, higher growth area is our most recent investment and holds great promise, as testing for defects and security vulnerabilities is now a necessity in virtually every market segment, ranging from automotive, to health, to energy, to financial markets.", "Our objective is to provide both developers and users of software with tools to automatically check for quality and security issues, as the software is being developed or ", "used in larger systems. The size of this tools market is approximately $2.4 billion, highly fragmented, and growing about 20% per year.", "Driven by a universe of 20 million plus software developers and a cost of failure that has gone up dramatically, particularly when human safety is at stake, this market is evolving rapidly. Last week you may have seen the President\u2019s budget proposal, in which he asked for a 35%, $5 billion increase in the U.S. cyber security budget. Another good example is automotive, where, following some widely published hacking incidents, focused on software security and safety has become intense. ", "As we attract some world class experts, integrate technologies from the four software security companies acquired in last eight months, and closely collaborate with the automotive industry to help drive standardization efforts addressing cyber security, we\u2019re garnering attention and building a strong brand in the new emerging area of software sign-off.", "I hope you see from my comments that our Silicon to Software push is both well anchored and visionary. Last quarter we delivered excellent progress in virtually every area of our business. In summary Q1 was a very good start to the year, and we\u2019re well ", "on-track towards meeting our annual financial targets", "Our core business is solid with areas of promising growth; we continue to invest towards broadening our TAM; and our Silicon to Software vision aligns well with where the customer base is going, and opens up brand new markets.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. Building on the momentum from 2015, we continued to execute very well in a challenging environment. ", "Q1 business levels were strong. We met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets. And we returned $200 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. With our strong Q1 performance, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 2016 revenue, earnings and cash flow objectives. ", "Now to the numbers: As I talk through Q1 results and 2016 targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue was $569 million, with growth across all product platforms. Over 90% of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The duration of new renewable customer license commitments averaged approximately 3.7 years, which reflects a couple of large, longer-term agreements. Duration will vary depending on customer requirements and we expect the full year 2016 to average approximately three years.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $497 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $440 million, slightly below our target range, due largely to the timing of expenses which included some delayed hiring. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, and for the year, we expect margin to increase over 2015. We will continue to drive global operational efficiency in order to expand non-GAAP operating margin to a solid mid-20s range. ", "GAAP earnings per share were $0.39, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.68, above our target range. Similar to prior years, Q1 had a net operating cash outflow. The $35 million outflow was due largely to the timing of 2015 annual incentive compensation payments. We expect this strong operating cash flow for 2016, with a target of at least $500 million. ", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $706 million, with 16% onshore \u2013 and total debt of $228 million. In 2016, we plan to increase buybacks to slightly reduce share count. In Q1, we initiated a $200 million ASR, which we\u2019ll complete in Q2. There is $300 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. ", "In addition, we closed a couple of small acquisitions in the software security space, adding key technology to support our strategy and drive long-term growth. DSO was 57 days, within our target range, but up from Q1 last year due to strong business levels. We ended Q1 with 10,290 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies. The increase in headcount was due to planned hiring and acquisitions. ", "Now to second quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For Q2, the targets are: revenue between $595 million and $610 million, as we communicated in December, we expect more variability and quarterly revenue due to the timing of our hardware and consulting business.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses between $503 million and $522 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $450 million and $460 million; other income between $0 million and $2 million. A non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%. Outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.47 per share, and Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 to $0.81 per share.", "For 2016, revenue of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion, other income between $0 million and $4 million, and a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%. Outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, a reduction of 2 million shares versus our prior guidance range.", "GAAP earnings of $1.64 to $1.79 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 to $3.00 per share, capital expenditures of approximately $80 million, and cash flow from operations of at least $500 million.", "In summary, our priorities remain centered on managing the business to maximize long-term shareholder value; our predictable business model and strong cash profile provide a very solid financial foundation for this year and beyond and with our strong Q1 performance, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 2016 revenue, earnings and cash flow objectives.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And first, we will go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Krish Sankar", "Hi thanks for taking my question I actually joined a little late. The first question was Aart the Globalfoundries customers you mentioned, is it a new win or is it an existing customer what kind of margin profile do you expect for that business?", "Aart de Geus", "Krish if you don\u2019t mind we never call into about specifics about a customer. But Globalfoundries be it through the Globalfoundries side or the IBM side were customers before and I can only say that we are very pleased with the results and the support from Globalfoundries. It has worked very well. ", "Krish Sankar", "Got you, no worries. The second question I had was you know obviously you guys spoke about it last earnings call there have been a lot of chatter around impact about semi M&A on R&D? Kind of curious, have you actually started seeing any impact or what are your customers telegraphing to you either those that just finished the acquisition or those that are in the process of getting acquired?", "Aart de Geus", "So Krish, sorry you missed a little bit at the beginning. I tried to explain that we have really three customer categories the semiconductor ones the system houses and the software companies. When we are talking about consolidation in the semiconductor industry we are mostly talking about literally semiconductor companies, people that design chips, maybe embedding a lot of software, but nonetheless, are centered there. ", "And of course a number of the consolidations that occurred or that got started in the last 18 months have meanwhile progressed and closed in some cases, and we are engaged with all of these companies. As I mentioned in the preamble, we are very encouraged by the results that we have gotten, that we are faring quite well with this.", "And I think one of the reasons is that as companies look for becoming more efficient, they also often rethink which suppliers they want to work with and how they want to work with them. And given both our vision from hardware towards software and our ability to deliver a very broad I think well-honed set of platforms, we are not only a leader in helping them differentiate themselves in technology, but also far and away the lowest risk. And so we have fared well with this.", "Krish Sankar", "Thanks, Aart. And just a final question either for you or Trac, you guys have done a great job in execution and, talking about a mid-20s operating margin profile. I'm kind of curious, is this a business that can be a 30% operating margin business, driven by any kind of like levers you can pull on the OpEx side? Or is this a business where Op margin expansion is just purely a function of drop-through from the top line?", "Trac Pham", "Well, Krish, I would emphasize we're focused on driving high single-digit EPS growth sustainably. I think reality is getting to a 30% ops margin. You can do it for a short-term, but not sustainably over time. The nature of our business is pretty technical. Long-term, though, to drive high single-digit EPS growth sustainably, it's really going to come through a combination of driving top line growth and margin expansion. And the benefit we have in terms of trying to grow margins, we'll really be looking at how we balance the portfolio between core EDA, IP, and software integrity.", "And also as we look across our functional grids, whether that's R&D sales and marketing and G&A. I think typically you\u2019ve referred to the 30 \u2013 folks will look at R&D spend, but from our side, we'll increase margins either from driving that top line or balancing our resources.", "Krish Sankar", "Okay. Thanks, Trac. Thanks, Aart.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.", "Andrew Masuda", "Yes, it's Andrew Masuda asking a question on behalf of Tom. First one for Aart, just on the IP business, could you maybe update us on the percentage of IP that is outsourced today and, where do you see it going over the next year or two?", "Aart de Geus", "Well. First, it\u2019s actually a difficult question to answer, because the definition of IP that's outsourcable has grown dramatically in the last few years.", "For those that have followed us for many years, you recall that at some point in time we were proud to provide an adder and simple things like that. Today we are absolutely driving the state of the art of building blocks in terms of both complexity and some of the advanced [indiscernible] USBs and other interfaces are not only very complex on their own. They are also extremely complex as you put them into brand-new silicon technology, such as 10-nanometer or fin set.", "We ourselves think that at best, 50% or so has been outsourced. I just want to give the honest caveat that it\u2019s a little bit hard to estimate. But as a little side note the evolution in the market that we see both through some of the consolidations, but also through this move towards providing much more differentiation through the combination of hardware and software, makes a number of customers focus on the higher levels of abstraction. Meaning more and more of the software, and therefore an increased tendency to delegate or to outsource the hardware IP and we are in a certainly a very good position to benefit from that.", "Andrew Masuda", "Great. Thank you. And then next question is for Trac. Could you maybe just talk about your expectations on the linearity for operating cash flow as we move throughout the year?", "Trac Pham", "Operating cash flow. Let me describe the P&L and maybe that can help you. You probably expect that the second half revenues will be a little higher than the first half. Same thing with expenses, with EPS ramping up weighted towards second half. Lisa later on can probably give you more details in the after calls.", "Andrew Masuda", "Great. Thank you.", "Trac Pham", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Darren Jue", "Hi. It\u2019s Darren is here on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering about those large deals that drove the contract duration higher. Was there any sort of unusual level of discounting that had to be extended to get those customers to sign the long-term deals? Or was it sort of their desire to sign the longer term deals?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the reason customers sign long-term deals is maybe financial, but in most cases it\u2019s really because one is looking at a collaborative partnership that has the potential to create additional differentiating value for the customer. And over the years from time-to-time we have done very engaging \u2013 build very engaging relationships that have demonstrated that working closely together cannot only impact the way our tools are used presently, but also hone it for the specific situation that the customer has. And so although of course when you do a multi-year deal, you always make sure that it is balanced for both parties. You also make sure that one creates something that is beyond what would be just a customer supplier relationship.", "Trac Pham", "Darren this is Trac. I would stress that not only were the deals large, but they were quality deals. We did see run rate grow in Q1.", "Darren Jue", "Okay. And maybe just one other question for you, Trac. At least based on our model, looked like most of the upside in the quarter in terms of EPS actually came from the gross margin line. I was wondering if you could just talk about what drove that.", "Trac Pham", "Yes, the overachieve on EPS is really expense story. We were light on expenses. Typically we started the year behind in hiring and this year was probably more, more in common with that. We'll be catching \u2013 we'll try to catch up on our hiring for the rest of the year. If you look at our head count, it was pretty flattish versus the end of the year. That's where the upside came from.", "Darren Jue", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Yes, thank you. And couple of questions, Aart, about how your business is evolving and the end market and start with the most popular question, of course, having to do with consolidation. So it sounds as though so far it hasn't had an adverse effect on you in terms of post merger, budgeting versus premerger budgeting. The longer-term question is for you. Do you think that the concentration of your customer base, the top 10 or 20 will be up, down or sideways over time, at least in the core business? Do you think the top 10 to 20 will continue to account for half or more of your revenues, even taking into account some post merger cutting among some of your large customers? And couple other questions.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, by definition, when you have consolidation, that means that some customers are becoming larger, assuming that you continue the business relationship, which we have. And so I think that is not a new phenomenon and that will continue. At the same time, I've always been a believer that in times of consolidation, you can't look at it as a maturation of a market, or you can look at it as the beginning of a next phase. And the reason we're emphasizing and we're investing along the lines of working with both semiconductor systems and software developers is precisely, because we see an evolution in the market that we will continue to emphasize this increased role of the intersection between software and hardware.", "And so we are well positioned for that. Obviously, on the hardware side, we go as deep as anybody down into the silicon. On the software side, we have put down new gamuts in the software sign-off, software integrity space. ", "And then in the middle, we have a large business that deals with the intersection of those two, be it in verification or even some in the IP side. So I think we're well balanced and I tried to express that by saying we're trying to sort of follow the sweet spot of the industry. And in that context, of course, the players do change over time. But I think we're \u2013 we have solid roots down and I think good opportunities looking up.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "With respect to the IP business, you said yourself that in the early days, the technology was, that you offered was fairly primitive compared to what you do now. But it's always been the case that IP has been a fairly fragmented business. In other words, lots of different categories, which historically had made it hard to scale as far as margins were concerned. You've done better over the years now with margins, but my question is, particularly now in having to meet the needs of the new IoT markets, your new automotive strategy, et cetera. Could you foresee that the portfolio for IP becomes even more fragmented again and if it is so, how might that affect your cost structure or the margin profile going forward in IP?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think it's a good question, although I must say we never use the word fragmented about our own position because we see it as broad. Meaning that having more products available, more IP titles is actually a good thing, given that it is relatively costly to build up the channel that is capable of both selling and supporting this. Secondly, given that it's important to build good relationships with the customers and if the trust the IP1 delivers, they are more likely to come back for other things. And so in that context, I hope that we will continue to actually broaden the portfolio.", "But I also would say that we are deepening the portfolio because maybe to be more to the point, the difference between a USB 1, a USB 2, a USB 3 and now a 3.1 and a USBC are quite remarkable just in terms of the capabilities that go into that part. And then on top of that, you layer the evolution on the silicon side from I forgot when we started this, probably by 65-nanometer or so, and then down to 40, 28, 16, 14, 10, and now 7. That is a substantial evolution in terms of the complexity of what we deliver. And so all the more is a trust relationship, an execution relationship with customers essential. So if we can broaden it even more, that is good. But we also partner very well with some other key providers and our objective is to make sure that our customers are successful with this way of doing design. So far, I think it's proven to be true.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "One more for you, if I may, on strategy and then wrap up with Trac on Q1. So you've become quite enthused now about the automotive opportunity and the question there is how you see yourself positioned for that. In other words, do you think your play is largely at the IP and software integrity level, or do you think you can and should move up the supply chain into the automotive systems suppliers themselves, or even up into the OEM level that car companies themselves, as Mentor has done, for example, in some cases.", "Lastly for Trac, for Q1, would it be fair to say that the substantial sequential increase in your IP business was correlated to the unusually large sequential increase in the Asia-Pac business? And then on the other hand, was your decline from Q4 North America largely correlated to a sequential decline in emulation? Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "So let me start with your automotive question. The first reason why, of course, automotive is in so many discussions is because somewhat surprisingly so, almost overnight it has turned into the poster child of what digital intelligence can do. And this, I say surprisingly so, because automotive in the past has been a relatively slow adopter of silicon technology for many good reasons, because safety was absolutely paramount. And so it demanded a lot of very specific long-term design. I think this is changing radically, meaning that suddenly automotive is now on the clock tick of Silicon Valley, so to speak, of software combined with most advanced silicon. And therefore, many of the capabilities and tools and IP that we provide is front and center.", "Now, to your specific question of our position in automotive, we have a remarkably complete set of capabilities that is well vested in a number of automotive-specific techniques, such as making sure that the chips are designed with proveable safety and verifiability in mind. So in that context, we I think are very well positioned and very engaged at by the way, all the levels that you mentioned. So semiconductor companies, Tier 1s, even some automotive companies specifically. I don\u2019t want to go overboard with the enthusiasm here either. It\u2019s an industry that doesn\u2019t ship as many cars as their cell phones. So the numbers are somewhat moderated by that. But it is an industry that suddenly has caught the bug of how do they differentiate themselves in this new space and I think the race is very much on.", "Trac Pham", "So Jay, this is Trac. Your question regarding the geographic growth and the product growth, I wouldn\u2019t read into any correlation between other geographic growth and product growth. We see both emulation and IP as growth areas for us long-term and that's pretty broad-based. We're not expecting that necessarily comes from any one geography. It would be broad-based growth.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Right, but I was asking specifically if that was the case, however, in Q4 to Q1.", "Trac Pham", "In emulation, that would be partly the case, whether it's quarter on quarter, yes.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Aart de Geus", "You're welcome. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.", "Monika Garg", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I \u2013 First I have a follow-up on the questions he asked earlier. If you look at your closest feared Cadence they posted north of 26 points operating margin last year and we could see them going to at least 27 points in one or two years. Since you are still talking about mid-25% margins, my question is to understand it's not 30% of margin business, but could Synopsys be between 25 to 30 points.", "Aart de Geus", "Monika, we have said for a while that where we are heading is toward the mid-20s. So these numbers are all in that space. At the same time, one of the things that we decided to do a couple of years ago is to invest specifically in a new emerging area. And we did that with the belief and understanding that a lot of functionality would move into software, that the software was quickly going to reach the issue of complexity and then security issues that would become enormous, and we continued to invest in that. Of course such an area initially is not particularly profitable. But it has potential.", "Secondly, we have seen that the investments that we've made recently through some of the acquisitions initially bring about a small hair cut and those are the small differences that would make up or explain what you were mentioning. Be it as it may, our objective is very clear. Our objective has always been how do we deliver shareholder value over the long-term with a fairly consistent pattern so the intent is not to surprise anybody, but at the same time, to also not be hesitant to put our chips down if we see some opportunity. And that is exactly what we are continuing to do. You have noticed that in the last couple of years we have not been hesitant to also utilize our balance sheet towards buybacks, as we found them to be appropriate and have done so again this quarter. So the balance of those things is how we're managing the company.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Aart and then as a follow-up, how big do you think emulation market can become? And how are you thinking about growth of your emulation business this year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, you know, the emulation business is difficult to characterize because they are multiple players with multiple sort of cycles of product and there is some degree of \u2013 I wouldn't say seasonality as just things go up and down from one quarter to another because it's somewhat lumpy. Lumpy was the word I was looking for. Having said that, the reason that we are bullish around emulation is actually a broader one, which is that we are strong advocates and we think we strongly deliver around a vision of a verification continuum that allows to use emulation in the context of many other tools as appropriate for the task at hand.", "And without going too technically deep here, the reason this is important is because we are dealing with a space that goes all the way from verifying strictly some hardware to verifying some chips with embedded software all the way to people wanting to bring up entire operating systems and some application software on hardware that has not yet been built. And so in that context, the, the collection of technologies assembled in a platform that we have is truly quite amazing compared to where we were just five or six years ago. And we have seen that the take-up in system companies that are now hitting this intersection has been particularly positive and that was visible in some of the Q1 growth.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. The last one for Trac, Trac, at the midpoint you beat Q1 by almost $0.06 EPS and why not raise the yearly EPS guidance?", "Trac Pham", "Well, as mentioned, the overachievement was mostly on light expenses and, you know, most of that's timing, still early in the year. We are definitely focused on the full year, full-year EPS targets. At this point, we feel pretty good about the guidance.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Thank you, so much.", "Trac Pham", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I did just have one question about the M&A environment. Given the equity Capital Markets turbulence and maybe some economic softness, more broad, has it become a buyer's market for cash-rich companies like you in what has been sort of a consolidation strategy?", "And in other words, are you seeing more companies being shopped to you that are perhaps a good strategic fit, are companies potential acquisition targets more amenable to price terms and considering the answer to that, do you feel the best use of cash might be to decelerate M&A pace or stay on the same cash return strategy or like some dividends and share buybacks?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay, well, Gary, you probably know that we never respond to specific M&A questions. But in general terms, if you watch Synopsys, we have found a balance between using repurchase mechanisms and M&A as the two ways to leverage our balance sheet. When we look at M&A, invariably it's driven by two things. Either a mechanism to increase the strength of our SAM, meaning purchase companies that have either technology or market position that we think we can do better with or that strengthens our position, or just as importantly, maybe even more important is opportunities to create new TAM for us. And so in that sense, the last 18 months have been interesting because we've done a number of acquisitions, starting with a company in the software quality space.", "And the reason that one was important is because that is the fundamental platform to analyze software. And then just in the last I think eight months or nine months or so, we've acquired four security companies that can all pretty swiftly be integrated into the overall software analysis platform. And so these are all good examples of how we utilize our cash on an ongoing basis. ", "Now, are there waves of these? Yes, they are. Sometimes they are driven by the state of the market. But in general, I would tell you that many of these things are often on the radar scope for many years and the moment has to just be right to be able to acquire something both from a seller point of view and a buyer point of view. And there's quite a bit of dating that goes around before marriage. So in that sense, we're always busy.", "Gary Mobley", "Understood. Appreciate the response. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to line of Srini Sundar with Summit Research.", "Srini Sundar", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my call. First question is on the mid-20% operating margin that others have also explored. My question is what do you propose will be the timing and how exactly will you achieve it? Meaning will it come from the gross margin line or R&D or a G&A? So if you could\u2026", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well, in general, as Trac alluded to, at the end of the day, revenue growth is the single-best recipe to grow margins, and in that sense, we are heading there. And as mentioned, based on some of the past acquisitions and recent investments, we see that the haircuts will gradually fade away and our continued growth and diligent expense management will get us there. So to me the issue is not can we get there or not. Yes, we will. And we have been committed to that for quite a while.", "Srini Sundar", "Okay. And my next question is if you go down in the dimensions of the nodes, the number of products that the foundries, that the foundries will design will be reduced. So, for the industry as a whole right now, semiconductors form the bulk of the revenues. So maybe by 2020, what kind of revenue percentage will come from the difference, do you think?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, I would observe two things. The most advanced nodes by definition are always the ones that get adopted by the people that have both the skills to use them, but most importantly, have the business opportunity to leverage differentiation of faster, much more dense, lower power chips. Initially, that is invariably a small number, as the foundries themselves hone these processes to gradually grow the yields, meaning bring down the cost per chip. The most advanced design companies spend most money because they have an economic return on that differentiation. ", "If you look back at only three years or four years, the belief was that FinFET would be the reality for only three or four companies. Well, that is most definitely not the case. We are seeing actually a rapid increase now, as the proof points of solid FinFET technology are there by a broader set of companies. And interestingly enough, a set of companies that one would never have thought about in the past, the automotive companies, are suddenly interested here as well, as they want to introduce digital intelligence in their products. So I think the push will continue, which is not to say that it gets easier or much cheaper, but the value of differentiation is quite high and we will continue to work with those most advanced customers. ", "But as said, we also work equally much with the system houses that integrate these chips and each would have an understanding of the insides of the chip and the software that runs on it. So it's actually a fairly broad field of companies that we touch that are deeply involved with FinFET. ", "Srini Sundar", "Just one last question, your service revenues for Q1 seem to be the lowest among the last nine quarters. Any particular reason for that? ", "Aart de Geus", "The services line? It's right in the range, Srini, so when you look at the services line, it's a relatively flat at 61 versus the last quarter. And the nature of that business, that's where a lot of our IP consulting business does flow through. So it can move around quarter-to-quarter depending on the revenue signature and the project schedules. ", "Srini Sundar", "Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And there is no one left in queue to ask a question. I would like to turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, again, thank you very much for attending our earnings release. I think the first quarter was particularly positive as a start to the year and I think many of the issues that were alluded to last year actually quite mitigated. And so we have a strong outlook going forward. Thank you again for your time and we'll be available after the call for the analysts.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart De Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Aart De Geus.", "Aart De Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I am happy to report that we continue to execute very well. Our third quarter financial results were strong and we are raising our targets for the full year. We delivered revenue of $615 million with good growth across all product groups, most notably, verification and IP. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.76. We completed our second accelerated share buyback of 2016 and have repurchased a total of 325 million this year. Finally, we are raising our annual revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow guidance. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "In assessing the environment around us, we see continued volatility for semiconductor and systems companies juxtaposed with intense pressure to concede and deliver the next killer products. While the latest customer earnings results are better than originally anticipated, the forecast for 2016 semiconductor revenue remained sluggish and actually worsened slightly over the past few months. Nonetheless, investments in EDA are robust and Synopsys is both ideally positioned and executing well. Our commitment to customer success remains a key source of differentiation. Our technology vision is focused on critical products with the highest impact and we balance short-term and long-term investments to drive sustainable EDA and a new TAM growth and profitability.", "While it\u2019s still early to talk about 2017 specifically, given the ongoing semiconductor volatility and lumpiness of our growing hardware revenue, I will say that we are optimistic about our business and long-term prospects as we continue a track record of executing well in both good and challenging markets. In that context, I would like to thank our very dedicated employee team for their hard work and excellent execution in an extremely demanding environment.", "Let me provide some highlights from the quarter in the context of the three customer groups we serve: semiconductor companies, system houses and software developers in multiple industries. In describing the state and powerful semiconductors today, I would like to use the word rejuvenation as semi companies reassess and strategize to drive the next generation of growth. They are restructuring their businesses and targeting investments to attack the emerging opportunity wave of Smart Everything. For some, joining forces with another company is the chosen route. For others, it\u2019s to focus more tightly on their most differentiated areas of success. We have worked with a number of our customers through the consolidation process and in numerous cases we are successful in broadening their relationships. This quarter, we saw some additional consolidation and are confident in our ability to work with and support these in a constructive way.", "Regardless of economic challenges, investment in developing highly complex chips is a clear priority with migration to advance process nodes being a key strategy for our leading customers. As a technology pioneer, we are known for our expertise, broad portfolio, engineering support and track record of enabling these advanced designs. The cumulative number of FinFET designs continues to grow rapidly nearly 15% in just the last quarter and more than 95% of those designs rely on Synopsys\u2019 digital tools.", "At the other end of the technology spectrum, our key cat products are also a differentiator for us. Used at the very beginning of process development, they enable customers to simulate and optimize key elements of the manufacturing process. This also provides us early access to critical models and information that gives us a head start in our product development. In digital design, our fastest ramping product ever, IC Compiler II, continues to proliferate. Orders in Q3 were the highest in five quarters. More than 90% of our installed base has at least one production project completed or in progress with more than 200 production designs overall. At the Design Automation Conference in June, Infineon, Socionext, Samsung and Toshiba shared with the full house their successful deployment of IC Compiler II to significantly cut design cycle time, while achieving excellent quality results.", "In our mixed signal, our newly introduced Custom Compiler product has come out of the gate with great promise. Intrigued by its innovative visually artistic automation, which cuts importantly our task from days to hours, customers are showing high level of interest and we are seeing some good initial adoption. ADAC, GSI, Samsung and ST Micro shared their design challenge experiences and how they have deployed Custom Compiler to improve their productivity. In addition, we announced support for Samsung Foundry\u2019s 40-nanometer FinFET process. Also highlighted ADAC was the power of our EDA ecosystem with the goal of ensuring our giant customer success. Synopsys, TSMC and ARM hosted a popular event highlighting our collaboration efforts to enable design of the latest processors on the latest FinFET technology nodes.", "Let\u2019s now look at system houses who either develop their own chips or buy them from others. They too are seeing great opportunities as well as substantial challenges where they are at leading or established nodes. In particular, opportunities around virtual and augmented reality, big data and digital intelligence are extremely promising. Simultaneously, relatively new and traditional companies in verticals such as automotive and industrial are already adopting these advanced technologies ranging all the way from silicon to software, the essence of the technical challenge and promise, the intersection of hardware and software. With approximately 40% of our revenue coming from systems companies and substantial investments around the next generation Silicon to Software continuum, Synopsys is well equipped to engage on next generation opportunities.", "First, verification, the biggest design bottleneck today. A couple of years ago, we introduced our Verification Continuum platform. It integrates all critical software and hardware technologies into an increasingly seamless and high productivity solution. Positive customer reaction is leading to rapid adoption throughout the platform. ADAC, QUALCOMM, ST, Samsung and Oracle spoke about their successes using the Verification Continuum. Q3 business results were strong for both software and hardware elements and we are outpacing our competitors in terms of growth. Integration of the SpyGlass technology from Atrenta has taken our solution to a high level of impact for customers. Both the technical and business results have been better than initially expected.", "Hardware verification showed strength again. We are now the fastest growing emulation vendor in the industry and also saw record orders for our HAPS physical prototyping solution. An excellent example of our customer success this quarter is NXP, which selected Synopsys as its primary SoC verification and emulation solution for its next generation automotive, secure connectivity and smart connected products. Let me talk for a moment about automotive. Over the past couple of years, we have substantially grown our portfolio in this market segment from design, to verification, to IP, to security, including excellent progress in automotive standards certification. We are beginning to see real momentum in this high promise area.", "During the quarter, we announced enhancements to two of our virtual prototyping development kits, which are used by automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. One, models of Bosch IP to speed software development for electronic control units. And two, a new model for Infineon\u2019s next generation TriCore architecture. We also introduced a brand new test solution, TetraMAX II ATBG, which reduces costs and offers order of magnitude and faster runtime. While broadly used for many applications in the automotive context, TetraMAX II has already been certified for the stringent ISO 26262 Automotive Functional Safety Standard.", "Moving to IP, we again saw a very good demand across product lines and continued to expand our portfolio to address ever evolving market and product dynamics. At the leading edge of process technology, we won several important 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer projects, a testament to the trust customers have in us as they tape out critical chips containing our advanced IP. In Q3, we announced the availability of the new USB 2.0 type CIP, cutting power and area for cost sensitive and energy efficient IoT edge applications as well as the latest PCI Express 4.0, targeting advanced data intensive cloud computing. We also introduced our second generation embedded vision processor to strong demand, driven by emerging automotive, drone, surveillance and augmented reality applications.", "Closing with our software integrity products, our third customer group, software developers, range from semis and systems to enterprise companies in the financial, medical, industrial and energy segments. These developers face multifaceted challenges, immense software complexity with resulting product quality issues and the potentially devastating financial and safety impact triggered by security vulnerabilities. Software integrity is an emerging highly fragmented market, ripe for bringing multiple points tools together under a single integrated umbrella. Similar to how we build our EDA and IP positions over the years, our goal is to build a coherent highly differentiated and productive platform, which drives quality and security in software development. To that end, we are making good progress towards our comprehensive vision of software sign off. During software co-development, our solution enables detection and fixing of security vulnerabilities, quality defects and compliance shortcomings early in the development lifecycle. It also helps customers gain visibility into their software supply chain, thereby reducing risk inherits in third-party code.", "Having substantially strengthened our go-to-market approach and channel, we are beginning to see the number of large agreements grow, contract durations expand, international business improve and renewals increase. While still early, these are good signs. In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter and are raising our full year guidance. Our state-of-the-art technology and engineering support are key differentiators as we continue to drive excellent customer relationships. And we are seeing good progress as we invest in a promising brand new TAM.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Through the first three quarters of the year, we have executed very well in a challenging semiconductor environment. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance and again, achieving our multi-year objective of driving high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. In Q3, we delivered double-digit revenue on non-GAAP earnings growth and generated significant operating cash flow. In addition, we completed our $125 million ASR last week and year-to-date we bought back 325 million of stock.", "Now to the numbers, as I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue was $615 million, above our target range. We achieved double-digit growth across all product platforms with particular strength in hardware. Upfront revenue slightly exceeded 10%. We anticipate more quarterly variability as our business evolves, however we continue to expect annual revenue model that is approximately 90% time based. Over 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 3.1 years and we expect the full year average to be about 3 years.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $538 million and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $473 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter and 23.7% year-to-date. GAAP earnings per share were $0.42 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.76, above our target range. We generated $252 million of operating cash flow, driven by strong collections and business levels. We are again raising our 2016 operating cash flow target to a range of $525 million to $545 million.", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, with 12% onshore and total debt of $278 million. Last week, we completed our $125 million ASR. Year-to-date, we have used over 80% of our free cash flow for buybacks. We have $175 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For Q4, the targets are; revenue between $621 million and $636 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $537 million and $556 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $483 million and $493 million; other income, between zero and $2 million; our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.46 to $0.55 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 to $0.78 per share. For 2016; revenue of $2.41 billion to $2.45 billion, a growth rate of 7.5% to 8%; other income between $6 million and $8 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million to 156 million; non-GAAP earnings of $1.72 to $1.81 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3 to $3.03; a growth rate of 8% to 9%; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and cash flow from operations of $525 million to $545 million.", "Finally, we have executed very well in a challenging environment and expect to deliver outstanding results in 2016. Growth is strong across all product platforms with better than expected hardware sales, driving a good portion of the upside for the year. This does add more variability to the businesses as customer requirements drive the timing of shipments and revenue, which is recognized upfront. As we look to 2017, we are currently working on our budget and are assessing this year\u2019s hardware strength and how it will trend next year. Therefore, we would suggest that it\u2019s premature to change our 2017 estimates until we provide detailed guidance in November. In summary, the entire Synopsys team has executed very well. Our Q4 outlook is strong, our 2016 targets are substantially better than they were at the start of the year.", "With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. Yes. I would like to get a little more color on where the upside came from, from both the quarter and for the fourth quarter guidance, it sounds like clearly hardware is better than expected I guess in your original guidance, was there any other product area or GO that is coming in stronger that you previously expected?", "Aart De Geus", "Actually, we are fortunate that strength was very much across the board. And you highlighted already at the verification specifically the emulation ones would also highlight the IP business as having been quite strong. On the borderline between those businesses is also the hardware prototyping that has done quite well and then it\u2019s also interesting that all the way into our silicon engineering business, we have had quite good results there also. And so I think across the board we are executing well and we have seen our run-rate grow again.", "Rich Valera", "That\u2019s great. And just from a geographic perspective, it looks like you had another strong quarter in Japan after probably a year or 18 months of really tough certainly year-over-year performances there. Is there anything going on there? Is that sort of lumpiness in terms of the seeming Japan recovery here?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, as you well know, Japan has been sort of a bit of an up and down economy now for many, many years. And so I think our team continues to execute particularly well in Japan, but it is against the backdrop of a challenged economy. Maybe Trac can make a couple of comments about the year-to-year yen fluctuations that are really the only currency that we continue to deal with. But our business has been quite solid and there is a bit of hope that the Japanese economy after many years of restructuring and refocusing is actually seeing some signs of emerging health, let\u2019s say.", "Trac Pham", "So Rich, this is Trac. Let me just add that across the board and at the top level, we are actually doing very well. And then when you look at the geographic split as well as the product mix, we are doing well across the board. There is a couple of areas that might \u2013 that I would highlight is when you look at the services line from a product perspective in Europe, that again is also doing well and I just wanted to let folks know that it\u2019s really a function on the services line. It\u2019s a function of this year\u2019s hedge gains being just slightly less than last year. And then Europe continues to do well, but last year, we had an unusually strong product shipment that makes the comparison a little odd, but other than those anomalies, we are doing very well across the board.", "Rich Valera", "That\u2019s great. Just one final one for me, given the revenue upside you had for both 3Q and 4Q guidance, it seems like you could have possibly driven, dropped a little more at the bottom line. Wondering if you are actually sort of reinvesting some into the business and if so, maybe what areas you might be sort of reinvesting some of that upside into?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, Rich. So, you are right. When you look at the business for this year, margins will be relatively flat year-over-year. And what you are seeing is really two factors. One, the upside was as we mentioned driven by hardware, which has COGS. And the second part, as we look at the business, there are couple of opportunities to invest in both customer support as well as in product development. The ROIs on those investments were good and so we proceeded with that. I think overall I think I like the balance that we are striking between driving for growth as well as slowing earnings to the bottom line.", "Aart De Geus", "And in that context, I would add that we are looking at the software integrity business as one that continues to be a very interesting opportunity and so we did few acquisitions in the last 12 months that are being integrated well. And all of that has a lot of life, but it does require some level of investment.", "Rich Valera", "That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks, gentlemen. Excellent results.", "Aart De Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes, good afternoon. So first, following up on the last question on software integrity, what percentage of your long-term portfolio is in place today and how much do you think you have to add there both I guess through acquisition and also homegrown?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, of course, this is a slightly loaded question, because we don\u2019t comment about acquisitions before we do them, but we have been very clear that we look at this as a new emerging TAM that is in a market that has many, many players, a few large ones and many very small ones all having one hotter technology than the other and in a field that is clearly almost overwhelmed by the number of security issues popping up everyday. So, just to be clear, yes, we have no plan and are not addressing the overall space of security. We are focusing specifically on the development of software and how to recognize and avoid issues upfront during that development. In that context, we are making excellent headway, because a number of years ago, we started with a fairly narrow offering in terms of languages. We have substantially broadened that. That is all our own R&D investment. We have broadened in terms of adding a number of security techniques and we are now integrating these all on a more coherent platform, which allows us to deal with the people that have to confront the security and quality issues in a more coherent fashion. And so we have now moved to starting to build a relationship with other companies that can help certify again standards. The alignment with Underwriters Laboratories is a very good example of that and we have also worked with a number of people that need help in assessing. We are in the supply chain that their software come from and it brings about some interesting surprises at times. So, I think we are in a good position, but there are clearly many opportunities. And the focus really for the last 12 months has been to broaden in security and to substantially strengthen our ability to go-to-market and move towards gradual larger deals. And the overall vision for what we want to offer is really a software sign off just like there has been a hardware sign off for 25 years, software needs this.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay, thanks. Moving over to the hardware side of the business, do you view 2016 as an unusually strong year in hardware that might pale off a bit next year or is it strictly just the lumpiness of that business that gives you pause for 2017?", "Trac Pham", "Well, we would like it to be usually strong, but this is a business that we have gradually grown into. And we are well aware that it\u2019s a business that by nature is lumpy, because when people buy a hardware equipment, the equipment gets bought when they feel that they are in a good cash position and the shipments invariably are functional of when they actually need it and so under much less control than, let\u2019s say, a recurring revenue run rate. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a good business and it ties well to our overall verification proposition. And so we are encouraged by the quality of the products that we have and of course continue to invest in driving the state-of-the-art forward in this area.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And do you think this year will be a record year, both in terms of both dollars and share for you?", "Trac Pham", "Well, it certainly was versus the past. We are not commenting about the \u201817 yet.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And then I guess just one more long-term question, when you look at the emergence of the Chinese semiconductor market and how some of the domestic players have talked about doing manufacturing over time, how big do you think that market gets over time and how is your positioning in that market?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, for us, it\u2019s always a little strange when we hear about the emergence of that market given that we were already in China in the mid \u201890s. And so we have been very intimately involved in all the steps of the development and emergence of both the talent sets, the investments, the structure of the industry, its evolution, the ups and downs. And the fact that there is now an increase and emphasis on manufacturing is not a surprise, because the volume of design in China that could potentially manufactured in China has grown substantially both in actual amounts and in the sophistication. And so we are well involved with all the leading companies there and I think we are well equipped to participate in this ongoing growth rate, which I think will continue to be high. In general, if you look at our revenue, you will see that the growth in Asia-Pacific has certainly been substantial and there is no reason to believe that it will not continue at the similar rate at least for the time being.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes, thank you.", "Aart De Geus", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. A few of them, one, [indiscernible] you kind of mentioned next year you expect some lumpiness in the emulation revenue, I am trying to figure out what does it mean exactly for your revenue and margin profile?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, fundamentally, what it means is that we have a very high portion of our business that is very ratable and therefore, it tends to look a little bit like a straight line on the graph. Lumpiness means that sometimes you get a large order that needs to be shipped at a certain date and that revenue gets recognized at that moment and some other quarter, you may not get that. And so there is some variability that is possible in this. And maybe Trac, you can comment on the profitability or the COGS aspect of hardware business versus software?", "Trac Pham", "Obviously, hardware is a little lower than software, but it\u2019s still very profitable for us. And our goal ultimately is to balance that in the portfolio to drive earnings growth in the high single-digits.", "Krish Sankar", "Do you guys have any color or is there a way to quantify how much of your total revenues from emulation?", "Aart De Geus", "No, we don\u2019t break out individual products. Obviously, the EDA part is a large portion of our business and verification is substantial in that. But it\u2019s clear that this is an aspect of the business that\u2019s doing well. But I would highlight that the whole verification proposition has many, many other products. And over the last few years, we have added some really superb technology in the debugging side, partially via the acquisition of SpringSoft. More recently, you may recall Atrenta and really these building blocks fits very, very well together and are all doing quite well.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it, I mean it\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to follow-up, it looks like you guys have under $200 million left in the buyback, what is your capital allocation size in a go forward basis to the extent that you can comment on it?", "Aart De Geus", "We will say as what we have said in the past. We will continue to use our balance sheet in the way that makes more sense. In the past, that\u2019s been a combination of investing in M&A to drive long-term growth and then returning cash to shareholders when that makes sense. Just for reference, when you look at last year, we spent over $280 million on buybacks, which is almost 70% of free cash flow. And then this year-to-date, we have been pretty \u2013 even a little bit more aggressive with that and we have raised the buybacks to be about 8% of free cash flows for the year.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it, very helpful. And then just a final question, when you look into like the future and let\u2019s say, emulation does get to be a bigger chunk of your revenues even though it\u2019s lumpy and they have some slight detriment on the margin profile, I am curious, what are the levers that you guys actually have if you want to continue maintaining 8% to 10% kind of earnings growth profile, is it mainly going to come from top line growth or do you have other levers you can put to actually make the earnings profile better? Thank you.", "Aart De Geus", "Well, as you know, we can always try to drive profitability harder. At the same time, there is a balance there of how much do you want to invest in new opportunities. And we have done a very conscious effort already starting in the early 2000 in broadening our portfolio to build a substantial IP business and then most recently in the last 2.5 years in investing towards the software integrity space as opportunities to grow additional businesses. So over a long period of time, we remain very committed to deliver mid-20s operating margin as the constant objective, while maximizing the revenue growth as the way to continue to strengthen and broaden the company.", "Trac Pham", "Krish, this is Trac. I would add that our focus is to drive this business and grow this business sustainably over time, so that\u2019s going through a combination of both \u2013 a combination of revenue growth, operating margin expansion and then reduce our share count. And so those things collectively should help us grow our earnings at high single-digits long-term.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. Thanks guys.", "Aart De Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jackson Ader", "Thank you. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling. One question from our side and that is in the software portfolio, is there \u2013 you already spoke about I think some things that are outperforming your expectations, is there anything in the product portfolio that may be underperforming your projections?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, at any point in time of course, we have a very broad portfolio. To be honest, I am not sure how many products we have. And we have big products and many smaller products and so all of the products have waived. But this past quarter actually, economically speaking, the results were quite strong across the board and so nothing jumped out. But always, products that are in investment mode or that are in next generation mode, that\u2019s an ongoing job for us and has been now for many decades.", "Jackson Ader", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks. That was all from us.", "Aart De Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thanks. Good evening Aart and Trac. Aart, let me start with you on the subject of technology and products, somewhat broad question, one thing we are seeing pretty much across all of engineering software not just in the EDA part of it are some fundamental issues that are being addressed by some of the major companies around basic software architecture, computer science, if you will, in that respect as it relates to EDA, one of the more interesting announcements I thought at DAC was from answers regarding some new data and architectural issues that they are addressing. And so the question for you is do you think that you and EDA generally are positioned well enough in terms of capacity and so forth for the next number of years architecturally or do you think that these are some issues that you are now going to have to fundamentally address as some of your peers in engineering software seems to be doing. In terms of a couple of specific products in your case, it seems very clear that you are putting a lot of incremental or renewed effort behind DC and if you could comment on that and you are also seeing some good new momentum in DFM where you seem to have broken out of the sideways revenue pattern that you are in for quite a number of years or perhaps you could comment on your DFM opportunity as well?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, so when you say are you going to have to revise your architecture, we are revising architectures all the time and it tends to come in two ways into a constant smaller tuning and optimizations versus every so often doing a redesign of let\u2019s say, the data structure they use or the approaches to problems. And it is only through that, that we have literally been able for now 29.5 years to constantly be at the very leading edge of what technology can do and that\u2019s a necessity because we are half of Moore\u2019s Law and there is the manufacturing advances and then there are all the tools that make it possible to use these. So in that sense, we are accustomed to being sort of \u2013 for 29 years, we are behind the 8 ball, because every customer wants it to be better and so do we. Having said that, I think your generic observation that there are new opportunities emerging I think is interesting not just for us, but for the very fact that a lot of people are now looking at processor architecture changes to accommodate the fact that various forms of digital artificial intelligence will become a more and more important for different types of applications. And so we see a number of customers focusing now on what can they do to essentially reinvent computation to satisfy and enable that. And that ranges literally from what to do around big data all the way to a pattern recognition, learning and so on that gets applied to now a number of fields including automotive. So I can certainly never say that we are good enough. The whole point is to always say we are not good enough and keep pushing.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay. And then in your case, there was a specific sub-question regarding DC and your DFM business?", "Aart De Geus", "Sure. So the design compiler is a product that itself has gone through a number of these types of generations. And it\u2019s obviously a leading edge tool that has an immense broad utilization on all the most advanced nodes. And so they are two. We have a substantial effort ongoing for both optimization and tuning as well as looking at architectures that could improve things, going forward. DFM is a bit different. DFM tends to be a number of economically smaller products that are highly specialized. Many of those have also fewer customers because it addresses mostly the people that are manufacturing, but I don\u2019t have to tell you that the physics of manufacturing in the last few years has done an easy 10x of growth in complexity. And that is actually good news for us because that caters directly to some of the strength of that team. And we have made a number of fairly substantial investments, I would say going back 4 years to 5 years where we are seeing some good return on it now. And as mentioned to another question earlier, we have a broad portfolio and so it\u2019s a constant allocation of investments with an intent and hope to see a return 2 years to 3 years later.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "To finish up with Trac, a couple of financial questions, you seem now to have pretty much solidified your position as the second largest in relation to target by revenue after Cadence, by our calculation just doing some quick math after the results, it looks like your emulation business might have been up by nearly half sequentially and up maybe more than that year-over-year and so the question is given that kind of revenue growth, are you seeing some commensurate margin scaling in the emulation business or you basically have to give that up to get the volume deals done like with XP [ph] for example. And then could you say whether the percentage of revenue from your largest customer was up, down or sideways versus Q2?", "Aart De Geus", "If I may jump in, you just asked Trac a whole set of questions that he is definitely intending to not answer because not only do we not disclose individual products, we are certainly not disclosing the economic profile of those. But there is no question that whenever products do better, there is an opportunity to either improve the margin structure because that\u2019s what good business does or to continue to invest and accelerate the development of future technology and we clearly do both. And so we are thankful for that business being strong, but I think we will leave the commentary on that. Do you want to add anything, Trac?", "Trac Pham", "No, no comment at this point.", "Aart De Geus", "Anything else, Jay.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "No. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. We will go next to Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi everyone. I am not sure if it\u2019s been said, but congratulations on strong execution for the year. With hardware becoming greater mix to the revenue, I am curious to know whether or not this goes to a backlog building quarter, whether or not you can build on your year end backlog for 2015 of $3.6 billion and with some costs with respect to the longevity or sustainability of the strong hardware revenue, as you approach 2017, are you still going to try to provide guidance based on the old axiom of 90% of forward revenue coming out of backlog?", "Trac Pham", "Yes. Gary, this is Trac. We will give more \u2013 actually, we will give the specific backlog number at the end of Q4. What I would say is that year-to-date, our business has been very strong, bookings have been solid and then run rate has been up. So the underlying economics of the business is very healthy. And then for the quarter, I guess specifically for the quarter, 90% of revenues came from backlog.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay, alright. Just one follow-up question, I think in the past you commented that software integrity represented \u2013 might represent about $100 million in the total mix of the broader group for 2016, do you still feel comfortable with that revenue level?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes, that is what we are targeting for this year.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay, alright. Thank you, guys. Again congratulations.", "Aart De Geus", "Thanks Gary.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks Gary.", "Operator", "We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As a follow-up on the software security verification, your expectation was this segment to go 18% to 20%, is that the growth you are still seeing and when do we expect the segment to break even and then positive operating margin?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, we continued to invest. And as you know, we have also made some acquisitions. And so every time you do that, that pushes the profitability down somewhat, but the job of course is to bring that up as we integrate things. So we expect it to be slightly dilutive in \u201816. But we are very encouraged by a couple of things. One is that the quality, the sophistication of the solution that we have is truly starting to be viewed as strength. And so I think we have good opportunities. But in parallel to that, especially in the last 12 months or so, I think we have strengthened the ability of our channel to not only sell the solution well, but also to gradually move towards larger transactions. And as you probably know, many of these fields that are emerging tend to be very small deals and you build them gradually. Well, we have seen now a number of transactions grow in size. A number of them have become multi-year, which were different than what originally the companies we acquired started with. And we see the opportunity to have a stronger broader relationship with the companies that use our software. So all of that feels like the early days of EDA. And in that sense, we will reassess continually how to balance the profitability drive versus the growth. We will prioritize growth, but rest assured that it\u2019s only a business if it becomes profitable and if it becomes more profitable overtime, otherwise, it\u2019s a hobby. And so we will continue to push on that as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we will go next to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mitch Steves", "Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess the first question is kind of Intel side of the equation. They just announced a new partnership with ARM during their Analyst Day or I guess the big presentation. I am just wondering if that was expected or if that may potentially impact the business at this time?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes. Well, of course, it was expected, because we have been informed quite a while ago. And as a matter of fact, we have quite a number of customers, as you know, that do ARM cores and that optimize those for different set of technologies. And so I expect that we will be very helpful at getting the best out of the technology that Intel has to offer for people that want to build their products around ARM cores and we are already quite engaged in that.", "Mitch Steves", "Okay, got it. And then secondly in the software integrity piece, I know you guys already talked about the $100 million number, but if I were to think about the long-term growth, is it fair to assume that, that will kind of help pace or potentially at least keep up with semiconductor IP as a whole?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes, certainly. We look at our businesses in terms of growth rate as EDA being suddenly very profitable, but the lower growth rate, IP in the middle and software integrity at the top of those. And so it\u2019s almost a classic decision set on how to balance the investments among these different categories as we build the company that hopefully delivers continuous high single-digit earnings growth going forward by essentially balancing a portfolio of different needs.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. Thank you. Great quarter.", "Aart De Geus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Question on the operating margins, if we compare your op margins with Cadence, your margins are still like almost 250 basis points lower in spite of the fact Synopsys has much higher revenue base, almost 30% higher and we are seeing good top line growth. So, why are we not seeing more leverage in the model?", "Trac Pham", "We do have leverage in the model. I think as I mentioned earlier, margins are relatively flat this year, but it\u2019s important for us to manage this business sustainably over time. And when you look at the earnings guidance that we have provided for this year, it\u2019s predominantly driven by operations, right. And so our balance this year is just trying to invest appropriately to drive growth long-term, while also generating high single-digit EPS growth.", "Monika Garg", "Yes. Just a follow-up then, semi industry is in the midst of consolidation, but Synopsys had seen two good growth years last year, it grew 9%. You are guiding to almost 8% for this year. So, the question is, are you not seeing impact on consolidation or do you think you are gaining market share?", "Aart De Geus", "Well, we certainly do see the impact of consolidation, because all of these transactions come to us initially always with the request of can you reduce our cost? And while we are trying to accommodate customers as much as possible, we also try to offer our solutions, whereby we can do fulfill a broader set of their needs. And in that context, I think we have continued to do well also because many of the technologies that we provide are essential and are at the leading edge. So, none of this is simple. And as you well know, in our industry, we have talked for quite a number of times, including at many of our earnings releases about what\u2019s the impact of this. Maybe especially in 2015, where there were a number of very large consolidations, I think we have fared well with these and we are thankful for that, but this is just part of an evolution in the industry around us and I think we are well positioned to continue to be a cornerstone supplier to people that are really going to drive their own companies to the next state-of-the-art level of applications and that\u2019s a good position to be in.", "Monika Garg", "Thanks a lot.", "Aart De Geus", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I will turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Aart De Geus", "Well, we thank you for your attendance at this call.

We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. ", "All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. Finally, please note that we issued a second press release this afternoon announcing the close of the acquisitions of Cigital and Codiscope.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart De Geus.", "Aart De Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We\u2019re happy to report a strong fourth quarter finish to an outstanding fiscal year for Synopsys, as we enter 2017 with a very solid foundation. We again delivered excellent financial results, while successfully balancing investments for the short and long term. We made very good progress in digital design and verification. ", "Our IP business delivered strong results, and we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions, including the acquisitions we announced earlier this month. Summarizing our financial results for the year: We delivered revenue of $2.42 billion, an 8% increase, reflecting strength across all product groups. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.02 or 9% growth.", "Our three-year backlog remained very strong at $3.54 billion. We generated $587 million in operating cash flow. We bought back $400 million of our stock and reduced share count. Building on our strong year-end position, and including the impact of the just-closed acquisitions, we\u2019re setting a 2017 revenue target of $2.57 billion to $2.6 billion, a non-GAAP EPS objective of $3.16 to $3.23, reflecting high-single-digit organic growth with modest near-term dilution from the acquisitions, and an operating cash flow goal of approximately $500 million. ", "Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. As we head into 2017, we see varying technical and business dynamics for the three customer segments we serve, Semiconductors, Systems, and Software Developers across multiple industries. Semiconductor companies sell chips that they may or may not manufacture, and where design, verification, and in some cases, embedded software drive differentiation. ", "From a technology perspective, many push state-of-the-art silicon design non-stop. This means optimizing for performance, power, area, and yield using advanced manufacturing processes and pushing our tools to the limit. While the cost of Moore\u2019s law is tightening the race, the quest for still more complex chips delivering still more performance continues. ", "At the same time, whether to drive efficiency through size or to scale up into vertical segments, some companies are divesting parts of their businesses or combining with others to better position themselves for the next wave of growth. While these consolidations initially are a headwind for the EDA industry, Synopsys has thus far successfully navigated some large M&A combinations in a number of cases even expanding our customer relationships. ", "Our multi-year business model, combined with our technology, platforms, and market leadership provides an excellent backdrop to help our customers through these transitions. System houses, which contribute about 40% of our revenue, develop products that incorporate multiple chips, their own or someone else\u2019s, as well as their own or third party software. Their differentiation manifests itself in terms of product capabilities and time to market. This opportunity space is great, with exciting new applications such as digital intelligence, machine learning, smart IoT, 5G mobile networks, virtual and assisted reality, and massive cloud-based computing to name just a few. ", "Many of these are already visible in newly energized verticals such as automotive, industrial, and health. The challenges at the complex intersection of hardware and software are substantial, yet this is exactly where Synopsys excels. Finally, software developers in many industries grapple with acutely growing security vulnerabilities. ", "These exposures can have a dramatic impact on security, safety, and even health, with potentially staggering financial implications. We\u2019re enthusiastic about the step-by-step scaling of our software integrity solutions, which is happening at just the right time to help these organizations take their security strategies to the next level. For Synopsys, our unique position reaching literally from Silicon to Software enables us to help all of these customers, and positions us well for high impact and growth in the years to come.", "In that context, let me provide you some highlights starting with the roots of Silicon. The push towards bringing smaller, faster, lower-power chips to market sooner is unrelenting, and FinFET technology continues to advance. Our FinFET-proven flow begins with the earliest TCAD and lithography simulation models, key enablers of Moore\u2019s law. During FY 2016, we announced a new solution that brings TCAD into the up-stream research phase to help manufacturers reduce process development time. ", "We\u2019re already involved in 3 nanometer and even initial 2 nanometer research. Our unique position in TCAD is a differentiator that grants us early understanding and access to key models, giving us a head start in terms of product readiness. As the clear leader in advanced FinFET design, we continue to see rapid adoption of 16, 14, 10 nanometer and test chips at 7 nanometer nodes. ", "The statistics are compelling. The cumulative number of completed FinFET designs is approaching 300, with Synopsys relied on for more than 95% of those chips. Meanwhile, 48 out of 49 leading-edge tape-outs at 10 nanometer and below are using our design tools. ", "During the year, we announced broad foundry certification, including from TSMC and Samsung for our digital and custom/analog tools at the most advanced processes. In digital design, IC Compiler II continues to proliferate and progress technically to help customers with their most advanced designs. ", "Leading adopters including Intel, Samsung, TSMC, Broadcom, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Toshiba, Socionext, Infineon, and Huawei shared some of their most intriguing challenges and IC Compiler II successes during the year. It\u2019s the fastest-ramping product in our history, including a record second half and has been used in approximately 250 production designs on over 25 different foundry processes. ", "In custom/analog design, this year we introduced a brand new product, Custom Compiler. The result of several years of development, it features an innovative approach that accelerates key part of design from weeks to days, targeted specifically at FinFET. While still in the early stages, it has generated considerable interest now converting into adoption by customers including ST, GSI Technologies, and AK Microdevices, with support from leading FinFET foundries. ", "Now to verification, an immense challenge that is only getting more difficult, with highly complex systems featuring sophisticated silicon and increasing amounts of embedded software. Our Verification Continuum platform, born out of an early vision and collaboration with our customers, is making a big impact. Built around the fastest simulation, emulation, and prototyping engines, it delivered an outstanding year of growth.", "We made great progress on all elements of the platforms and integration, yielding significant competitive displacements in leading customers. One example was a major enterprise-level partnership and expanded commitment to Synopsys by one of the world\u2019s top mobile semiconductor companies. This year we also unveiled a breakthrough innovation, enabling massive parallelism to speed up our franchise VCS simulation product. ", "In addition, the SpyGlass technology from Atrenta has exceeded our expectations. Our hardware verification product had a very strong year, with record orders for our ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping solutions. We\u2019re the fastest-growing emulation vendor in the industry. An excellent example of our momentum is NXP, which selected Synopsys as its primary SoC verification and emulation solution for its next-generation automotive, secure connectivity, and smart connected products. ", "In IP, we saw growing business momentum through the year and significantly expanded our portfolio and vertical market reach. We\u2019re seeing very good demand for our comprehensive interface IP portfolio. Continuously at the forefront of new standard development, we offer customers high-quality titles, as soon as a new standard is released. TSMC recognized us as Interface IP Partner of the Year for the sixth year in a row, and we were named SMIC\u2019s Interface Vendor of the Year for the third year straight. ", "We were first to market with the new USB Type C, and are the only IP company with USB 3.1 certification. We delivered the latest PCI Express 4.0 IP, targeting advanced data-intensive cloud computing applications. We continue to drive the state-of-the-art in the most advanced nodes, winning several important 10 and 7 nanometer projects. Lastly, our embedded vision solution provides a leading-edge, and easy-to-use, processor/neural network combo that leverages machine learning, one of the hottest applications out there.", "Another key focus for us not only in IP, but across our entire Silicon to Software product spectrum, is automotive. We\u2019ve expanded our automotive portfolio, and in FY 2016 made accelerated progress. We delivered several advancements for next-generation automated driving and infotainment, including our newest embedded vision processor. We drove key design wins at major automotive semiconductor companies, thanks to having grown the broadest portfolio of automotive-certified IP in the industry. ", "Enabling software development 15 months prior to silicon, we delivered our virtual prototyping solution to a leading supplier of driver assistance systems. We also signed a large agreement with a leading U.S. automotive OEM. Our digital and custom design tools added new design and analysis capabilities focused on ensuring the extreme reliability required for automotive applications. ", "Key tools throughout our EDA, IP, and Software Integrity portfolio are certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety measures defined by the ISO 26262 safety standard. Our focus on automotive software security is becoming increasingly well-known. In fact, we\u2019ve teamed up with leading OEMs, Tier 1s and semiconductor companies to drive software cybersecurity standards for automotive through SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers. ", "Our reach continues to expand to include new entrants, as well as traditional leaders such as Bosch, Delphi, and Continental. Stay tuned for continued product advances and new technology milestones this year. ", "Next, to our Software Integrity group, which provides products and services to build quality and security into the software development lifecycle and across the cyber supply chain. Building on the acquisition of Coverity a couple of years ago, we\u2019ve added key technologies both organically and via acquisition, while simultaneously unifying the sales organization. ", "Our go-forward strategy is three-fold. First, continue to broaden and deploy our Software Sign-off Platform as the foundation of our offering. Second, accelerate our penetration of key verticals in both the embedded and enterprise spaces. And third, drive demand creation, with ecosystem partners, certification projects, and services. ", "To that end, we just today completed the acquisitions of Cigital, which specializes in security consulting services, and Codiscope, a spinoff of Cigital with related developer tools. We\u2019re very excited about this combination, as it will accelerate our ability to reach customers and expand our market in new segments. The companies are strategically aligned with a shared vision, and bring complementary elements to the table. ", "Synopsys leads with best-in-class products. Cigital attacks security problems from a service angle. Synopsys has a very strong presence in the embedded space, including automotive, medical devices and IoT. Cigital is a leader in serving enterprise customers, with particular strength in financial services. And finally, Cigital brings a demand creation element, with customer touch points earlier in the security strategy development process of our customers. ", "Cigital and Synopsys are both named in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for application security testing. In this highly fragmented, emerging market, the combination will enable us to provide the most comprehensive portfolio available in the market today. From an overall company financial perspective, our primary long-term objective remains to drive high-single-digit non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a multi-year basis, through a mix of the following:", "One, grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single digit range; Two, grow revenue in IP/Systems and Software Integrity generally in the low double-digits; Three, actively explore TAMexpanding R&D and M&A opportunities; Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range; And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of stock buybacks, M&A, and debt repayment. While the results in any given period may vary, based on acquisitions or other near-term priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent.", "To summarize, Synopsys delivered another excellent year, even in the context of a challenging semiconductor landscape. In terms of both total and EDA-related revenue growth, we outpaced the competition in 2016. We continue to invest in the short-and long-term, organically and via acquisitions, operationally and with share buybacks, all to drive long-term shareholder value. Lastly, we\u2019re making good progress in building our software security platform and market segment position. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham ", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. As I reflect on the past year, I\u2019m pleased with our results. We again delivered on our near-term financial goals, while investing for sustainable long-term growth. This strategy is paying off. Our EDA and IP solutions are doing well, offering a combination of healthy growth and profitability. ", "We\u2019re also building out a new, higher-growth software security platform, which is gaining critical mass. This diverse product and customer portfolio positions us very well, and supports our near-and-long term objective of driving high-single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. ", "In 2016, we achieved substantially better financial results than we originally anticipated. The entire Synopsys team executed very well, and Q4 was a strong finish to an outstanding year. We delivered high-single-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth, and generated significant operating cash flow. We bought back $400 million of stock to reduce the share count. And earlier this month we announced two acquisitions to further scale our software security platform. We enter 2017 with a solid foundation and are confident in our ability to achieve our financial objectives.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. We delivered total revenue of $634 million in Q4 and $2.42 billion for the year, an annual growth rate of 8%. There was strength across all product groups, including record hardware sales. Over 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of Q4 and 2016 revenue. ", "The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.7 years for the quarter and 3 years for 2016. We expect the 2017 average to be about 3 years. Our three-year backlog remains strong at $3.54 billion, and reflects good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals. ", "Importantly, approximately 80% of our 2017 revenue target is already in hand, which provides stability and predictability. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $551 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $488 million for the quarter and $1.85 billion for the year. ", "2016 expenses increased due largely to higher costs associated with employee compensation, acquisitions, and cost of goods sold for hardware sales. We delivered solid non-GAAP operating margins, 22.9% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year. GAAP earnings per share were $0.47 in Q4 and $1.73 for the year. ", "Non-GAAP earnings were $0.77 in Q4 and $3.02 for the year, an annual growth rate of 9%. We generated $148 million of operating cash flow for the quarter and $587 million for the year. We exceeded our original 2016 target due to strong collections and business levels throughout the year. ", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1.1 billion with 15% onshore and total debt of $205 million. Earlier this week, we renewed and expanded our credit facility to $650 million and took out a $150 million term loan, providing excellent flexibility to support our strategic goals. ", "In 2016, we used about 80% of our free cash flow for buybacks. As a result, we reduced share count by 3.3 million shares, and intend to slightly reduce it again in 2017. We have $435 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Operating cash flow is expected to be strong in 2017, with a target of approximately $500 million, even with an outflow associated with the recent acquisitions. We expect the quarterly profile to be similar to prior years, with a net outflow during Q1, driven largely by 2016 annual incentive compensation payments. ", "Before moving onto 2017 guidance, let me briefly comment on some of the details of the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, which were funded using a combination of U.S. cash and debt. They are expected to be modestly dilutive to 2017 non-GAAP EPS, and reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2018. ", "Now to first quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance which includes the impact of Cigital and Codiscope. For Q1, the targets are: revenue between $630 and $645 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $540 and $558 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $485 and $495 million; other income between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.43 to $0.50 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.77 to $0.80 per share. ", "For 2017, revenue of $2.57 billion to $2.6 billion, a growth rate of 6% to 7%. Keep in mind as you model 2017, that hardware sales add variability to revenue, driven by the timing of customer requirements and shipments. Other income between $0 and $4 million; A non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $1.92 to $2.06 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3.16 to $3.23 per share, high-single-digit growth when the modest dilution from Cigital and Codiscope is excluded; capital expenditures of about $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $500 million. ", "To help in your modeling, we expect second half revenue to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter; total non-GAAP expenses to skew slightly toward the second half of the year; and second half non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q2 the lowest EPS quarter.", "In summary, we continue to evolve our company to maximize long-term shareholder value. Our active diversification and investment strategies are working. We delivered very solid growth in revenue and profitability, and significant cash flow in 2016. We returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks. And we made the appropriate investments to drive sustainable, high-single-digit, non-GAAP EPS growth. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Operator", "Alright, are we ready for questions?", "Trac Pham", "We are.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Alright. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Please go ahead sir.", "Krish Sankar", "Hi, thanks for taking my question, I had a few of them. Aart, number one, if I look at the annual backlog, it was down almost 2% year-over-year, even though the duration went up, can you just help us reconcile that? And then I have a few other questions.", "Aart De Geus", "Sure. Backlog is completely dependent on the timing of the very large deals, and given that we have a number of large customers that do multi-year deals, typically backlog will tend to go down until it goes back up. And so, from our perspective actually this turned out to be a very strong backlog year, and so we are very well on track with this.", "Krish Sankar", "Alright. And then the next one is, in terms of your Cigital and Codiscope acquisition, should we assume the revenue generated from that is roughly like $100 million for FY 2017? And along the same path, is this going to be similar to the Coverity from a few years ago where it\u2019s probably $0.10 dilutive the first year and then turns accretive like a year and a half down the road?", "Trac Pham", "Hi Krish, this is Trac. Yes, Coverity did do about a $100 million for this year as we had expected. As far as Cigital and Codiscope I would model that roughly at half that business, and although it\u2019s modestly dilutive to 2017, we do expect it to be accretive by second half of 2018.", "Krish Sankar", "Alright. And then, final question of my end is can you give us an update on how your digital landscape is shaping up, because one of your biggest competitors seems to have some pretty good wins or penetrations on the digital side, which has kind of been your strongest forte for several years. So, I want to find out what you guys are doing on that segment in trying to protect your market share. Thank you.", "Aart De Geus", "Well, in general the digit space is strong for us because the complexity that comes with chips with many more transistors and simultaneously fairly difficult to achieve performance and power objectives, demands the utilization of sophisticated tools, and this ranges by the way from the synthesis to the place & routes to older tools that are around that including of course all the verification tools as well.", "So, in that space, we have seen very good results, it is very competitive at any point in time, but we are also seeing that our technology this year has really strengthened substantially. So, this has been a very strong year, especially second half and as we enter into 2017 we feel that we are in a good position.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. I just want to follow up on the backlog question. Aart, you said it was actually quite a strong year from a backlog perspective or presumably a bookings perspective, were you referring to sort of bookings run rate? Just wondered what you meant by that statement.", "Aart De Geus", "Well, our run rate is up periods, but when we look at bookings there is some years that have more, some years that have fewer large transactions and most of those are somewhat predictable in terms of their timing because of course they have on average about a three-year cycle, and so if in any given year, let\u2019s say for argument sake you have one or two larger transactions that were to happen at the same time that in that year you would see the backlog spike up substantially and then consequently in the next two years after that by a natural utilization of the backlog. If I can call it that, you would see a decline. And so, against that complete understanding of where these things are, our statement is we had a very good year and we are in a very solid position in terms of the backlog that we have enhanced for predictability for 2017 for example.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. So for the deals you did book this year that were scheduled to book, you were pleased with the run rates of those deals, but there's some large multi-year deals out there that obviously didn't happen in this year. Got it.", "Aart De Geus", "Yes. And were not intended to happen in 2016, right.", "Rich Valera", "Right. That makes sense. And then, with respect to hardware, you had a pretty high level of upfront revenue again this quarter relative to historical presumably driven by hardware. Still thinking about the model in the same way, that was sort of 10% or less is still the target model going forward?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes this is roughly the target model we are moving forward with. And 2016 was very strong in terms of hardware, and so you never quite know exactly when the hardware comes in because it tends to be lumpy, but there\u2019s no question that from a technology point of view we have any solid situation and there\u2019s also no question that fundamentally all kinds of acceleration techniques in hardware are necessary for many of the very complex hardware software products that are coming to market. So, I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a good area for all of the EDA vendors and specifically for us also.", "Trac Pham", "Hi Rich this is Trac, for modeling purposes you should feel comfortable that we will maintain the 90/10 model.", "Rich Valera", "Got it that makes sense. And then, for emulation, I think a quarter ago you mentioned - with hardware in general, a quarter ago you had mentioned not to get maybe too excited about extrapolating the growth you were seeing in hardware this year into next year. I'm wondering what in the end you decided to bake into the fiscal 2017 guidance with respect to hardware. Can you give us any sense of how you're thinking about that business on a year-over-year basis as we move into 2017?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes, I think that we are not too excited at the beginning of the year apply to Synopsys pretty much every year. We are by nature cautious as we look forward, but at the same time we do not see any decreasing demand for the technology, and so it may be spiky from one year to another. But fundamentally, it's a good business that we expect to continue to see good results in.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. Thanks very much, gentlemen.", "Aart De Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thank you, good evening. Aart, let me start with you with regard to the semiconductor consolidation effect and how that all played out over the last year or so. So, thinking back to a year, year and a half ago, you and your peers were quite apprehensive when that first wave of mergers were announced and you were quite concerned about what the adverse effects might be on EDA, and now as it turns out, it perhaps wasn't so adverse after all, at least not as much as you might have thought sometime back. So what didn't happen is the question, in terms of what you had originally been apprehensive about that turned out not to be the case. And to the extent there is further semi-consolidations that we're not quite done with that. Do you think that in the future, such consolidation might be the same, not so terrible after all kind of outcome?", "Aart De Geus", "Well you know, I would almost like to start with what did happen and I think this is a statement that\u2019s probably true for the entire EDA industry, we worked really hard in light of seeing this happen. On the side of what did not happen is there was certainly no slowdown from a technology point of view. And so as much as these consolidations to some degree are set-up to try to reduce the overall cost equation for these companies, more often than not rather than getting the cost reductions what they do is spend the money immediately on just doing more demanding products and taking advanced technologies because they still want to differentiate themselves. ", "And so we\u2019re fortunate enough at Synopsys to be positioned very close to the leading edge. Those are people that with or without consolidation they want to be differentiated and that\u2019s how we balance things. In my preamble and I\u2019m sure I must have used the same words a number of times in earnings releases in the past, I would say well you know, a consolidation is momentarily a headwind, but in the long term these companies are morphing or merging because they want to attack a new market and there\u2019s no question that if you look at the overall high-tech horizon that electronics plus software combined in the next decade will have profound impact, how it manifests itself for these companies while that is precisely what they\u2019re raising towards. And so I think we are part of this race one way or another even if during a merger the mandates from the top 10 to be safe money. The mandates then pretty quickly shift to become more differentiated and that\u2019s where we are playing. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Would you be willing to speculate on what the possible competitive effects might be seeing potential - pending, rather, acquisition of Mentor. Is it simply a matter of a new, much larger owner pouring money into R&D and/or sales that might incrementally make a competitive difference or how do you think about what the effects might ultimately be?", "Aart De Geus", "Yes, the word speculation is not really part of our vocabulary, I think in this context. I think the only positive is that this acquisition shows the value of EDA and I think hopefully it reflects well on all of us.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer ", "All right. Wrapping up for me on the technology side, it became increasingly apparent earlier this year that Synopsys was incrementally investing in design compiler. Well of course you\u2019ve always invested in it, but it looks like you were doing it incrementally. And to the extent that the synthesis market has been by and large sideways for the last number of years, what is it that you are aiming for with respect to the incremental investments in D.C? Do you think that there could be some new wave of growth at least for you in that part of the market?", "Aart De Geus", "I think if I look back at our - the entire history of Synopsys, which by the way in three weeks will be 30 years believe it or not, if there\u2019s one thing that we take some pride in is that for the vast majority 80%, 90% of our products we have in all these years always been at the state-of-the-art. ", "Now to stay at the state-of-the-art when you have that rate of change underneath implies a continual rotation of investments from one product to the other and from time-to-time there are bigger steps in many situations it\u2019s just constant delivery of new capabilities and so this is true for our entire portfolio and that certainly includes the synthesis, it includes the timing, it includes the power optimizations, the place & route, etcetera, and so it should not be a surprise that we invest in these tools that are absolutely central to a modern digital design. ", "I mean these are the type of tools that has made the Moore\u2019s Law possible from a design perspective. And with our third decade finishing or not, the fourth decade is absolutely aimed at technology leadership and driving the state-of-the-art and making it possible again. So, we will continue to invest at a strong clip in R&D because that is how we have been successful as a company.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thanks Aart.", "Aart De Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line the Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty", "Thanks, hi guys. Let me approach the question this way. With the upfront becoming bigger each quarter through the year, positive comments around what hardware did for you this year, positive comments about IC Compiler II, it would seem like it leaves the rest of the core EDA software portfolio as the area that softened in terms of growth year-over-year. Is that the case, and what areas do you think you have the potential to turn in fiscal 2017?", "Aart De Geus", "Well you know, for a start 2016 of course was very strong from an hardware point of view so that may balance how one looks at different products a little bit differently. And then individual products themselves go through waves of being more central to the renewal of agreements or not. In general though I would say that we have a really well balanced product portfolio because with a very strong position in the core EDA that is central really the continuation of advanced chip design and system design, around that the verification is reaching into the software, the design tools are reaching deep down into the physics of silicon and the software itself is now an area that is seeing good investments.", "And so we very much look at the core EDA as one of the key things that is enabling yet another business, which is the IP business. And so when you look at it more as a portfolio at any point in time the balance shifts a little bit because one technology sort of enables the other. ", "Finally, you are looking back at 2016. This was a year where we can literally say and this is as much an aim that the internal team see as any area is that every one of our businesses did very well. And any given year some do better than others. This year we had across the board very good success.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then on the acquisitions, if I heard the answers from the first questions correctly, it sounds like we should assume roughly $50 million in contributions for fiscal 2017 versus the $100 million that they did finishing up the year. Can you walk us through the accounting impacts in terms of the write offs, should that bounce back immediately to the $100 million level when we get to fiscal 2018?", "Trac Pham", "I don't think we were operating at that level to begin with, but yes, first of all you are right, it should be in that range after the Coverity business, the impact of that is a combination of the deferred haircut and the integration of the business over the next 10 months.", "Sterling Auty", "And how should that - is that something that we should see a gradual ramp through the year or up front loaded or hockey stick, as we\u2019re layering this in the context of the guidance.", "Trac Pham", "I would model it more of a gradual rent throughout the year.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay, thank you.", "Trac Pham", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thanks for taking the questions. My first question is on the operating margin, in the past you've talked about operating margin improvement to 25% range over time. And just along the same line, if I think about your operating margin and include stock-based comp in there, you're operating at about a 20% operating margin. If I look at semiconductor industry and new customers in general, they're about 25% to 45% operating margin. I guess like EDA is a pretty consolidated space, so why aren't the operating margins higher and why aren't you aspiring for higher operating margins in general?", "Trac Pham", "No, we are aspiring for higher operating margins and we remain committed to driving margins through the mid-20s. As you are looking at this 2017 guidance and you separate out this Cigital and Codiscope impact, we would have grown margins very healthy from 2016 to 2017. Now the factoring in the dilution impact of that we\u2019re going to see it roughly flat year-over-year, but the underlying health of the business is good and we are growing margins there.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it, thank you. And did you get a crate like how much is the total net impact to the EPS from the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions?", "Trac Pham ", "A modest impact to EPS.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Is it like $0.10, $0.05, any color on the level of impact?", "Trac Pham ", "Modest impact to EPS.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Okay.", "Trac Pham ", "I would say that due to something to keep in mind is that net of that impact we would have been growing EPS in the high single digits.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. Than I had question on custom compiler, you talked about some of the strong momentum in that area. How do you see that product growing and is that a growth driver for you over time and how it can become.", "Aart De Geus", "Yes it is a growth driver over time, but it starts from a very small base and the company right now round numbers is sort of at that 2.5 billion and so an individual small product does not have the impact to change with the overall revenue line really is markedly impacted. Nonetheless, it is an area that we\u2019re gaining strength in that before we didn't have. And this is especially true in the conjunction with an outstanding analog mixed signal and custom verification set of tools and specifically in the area of FinFET and so we have good hopes actually for some really good results in 2017.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thank you, that's all I had.", "Aart De Geus", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes, good afternoon. Quick question on the software security side of the business, so following the two acquisitions, do you feel as though you're at critical mass today or are there pieces or scale that you still need? ", "Aart De Geus", "It does feel like we are heading towards some degree of critical mass and we are driving the business now towards profitability after the delusion issues that we will be passing and the reason I think we are starting to have critical mass is because we are seeing the deals that we are making grow in magnitude and the number of large deals is growing from quarter-to-quarter, but just as important from an operational point of view is, I think our sales team is now delivering significantly on their own projections, and that sounds like a trivial thing, but it\u2019s actually not. ", "It is that we are increasingly on top of the market segment where we know what we are doing and where there is demand that is growing. Now having said that and you all know this, the word security occurs in so many different dimensions, and of course this is a world market with a much larger number of potential users than what we would have seen in EDA, initially of course at much smaller transactions sizes, but in a set of verticals that we have never touched in the past. ", "And so just to highlight one aspect of Cigital is they are particularly strong in the financial market, and that is a market that\u2019s while we had a number of successors in the past they were sort of, I don't want to say accidental, but they were not systematic to say the least. This changes that immediately and moreover because of the service nature and because of their ability to help do diagnosis at a higher level in a company of the general readiness for security, I think it gives us an entry point with the CIOs and CTOs of companies that we didn't have before. And so all of these pieces combined as we integrate them, I think we will start to feel like increasingly a critical mass and it\u2019s a word that I like myself quite well.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And when you look into going into verticals like the automotive world, what is the long term business model look like there? Is it consulting, is it licenses is it royalty-based?", "Aart De Geus ", "Are you talking for security or in general?", "Tom Diffely", "For security.", "Aart De Geus ", "Well I think it is will be in many cases the entry point tends to be a bit random because companies are random in terms of how they certainly are dealing with security although if you look at automotive, ever since about 15, 18 months ago you may recall the jeep was hacked. That sent a shiver for the automotive industry that had for literally decades done an extremely good job at driving the engineering to be on top of safety. Well, overnight the software part became the Achilles' heel of safety and therefore very much top-down from those companies all the way from their boards got the mandate off we have to deal with this. ", "And this is precisely why the service business is helpful because if you get a mandate top-down in the company let\u2019s say from the board of directors go deal with it first thing you need to do is to have sort of an assessment so where are you, and this is where Cigital has another key asset, which is over many years they developed a mechanism to assess in a number of dimensions the degree of security preparedness of companies. ", "And so that is a perfect entry point and that so-called v-sim maturity model can be used to then drive the dialogue to what should be the action taken and hopefully in those action rightfully so there would be a number of interactions with us on our products or additional services. So that is why I think all these pieces gradually fall into place, but it\u2019s in new market and so there is a lot of learning and where there is lot of enthusiasm about what we close today.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay great. And then quickly on the consolidation of the customer base, so if you look back to 2016 as a whole, do you think there was an impact at all from consolidation on your results?", "Aart De Geus ", "Well it\u2019s hard to say it didn't have impacts and it\u2019s hard to point exactly at what the impact is because as I said earlier whenever two companies consolidate within three minutes later it is, while we have to save money to pay for the premium that we just gave out. And you know consolidation is fundamentally either a move towards efficiency, strict economic efficiency, or it is a move towards and that\u2019s why I like these words critical mass horizontally be bigger in a market and therefore another way to be efficient or it is move towards vertical critical mass meaning heading towards verticals that before company couldn't reach or with the value proposition is moving up to stack.", "And so as companies navigate through just the hard practical integration and money saving phase, very quickly they end at what is it that they want to accomplish and not that means immediately money spending, but it certainly means immediately helping with differentiation. And that\u2019s why as much as these transitions initially are a headwind we've navigated recently well through them, I would say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg ", "Thanks for taking my question. Trac listed on the CFO last year cash from operations was $587 million, you are guiding $500 million this year, shouldn't cash from operations grow in line with operating income?", "Trac Pham", "Yes over time you should model you should assume that cash from operations should track EBITDA less cash taxes, but as we said in the past it will vary from year-to-year. 500 million we think is still a very healthy level of cash flow for the year. Keep in mind when we entered 2016 we guided to about 500 million and we over achieved that by over $80 million. So the comparison is a little bit tough year-over-year. The second thing to keep in mind is that we think there is roughly $30 million headwind on cash flows this year as a result of the dilutions and cash outflows related to the acquisitions, and then timing of some early payments that shifted from one quarter to next, or year to next.", "Monika Garg ", "Okay. Excluding these two acquisitions you just announced, how big is software security segment for you and excluding these two, is it possible now?", "Trac Pham ", "Coverity did end up close to where we expected to end up at 100 million, it was modestly dilutive as a result of some of the acquisitions that we made earlier this year, but it\u2019s trending very well in terms of growth and profitability. The Cigital, I think you asked for the side, Cigital and Codiscope is about half of that business.", "Monika Garg ", "Got it. Then if I look at IP and systems segment, grew 17% year-over-year, could you maybe split the growth between IP and systems in it?", "Trac Pham ", "No we won't split that out, but roughly the growth in those businesses are in line with the models that we previously communicated. And in general, I would add that both areas are doing very well and the IP business in particular saw a very, very good growth this year largely because complexity demands alternatives to design in one of the key alternatives is to buy those blocks that you can get on the market and that are cost efficient and while at the same time being super high performance and low power. And that is exactly the collection of IP that we have.", "Monika Garg ", "Got it. Last one on the emulation you said, it was the fastest growth in the industry cadence, also had a very strong year. Could you maybe talk about what was the growth for your business and emulation, how big is that now?", "Aart De Geus", "We are well aware of that the overall industry I think is doing very well in emulation, and the reason for that are in some way straightforward, which is the complexity of the chips for those people that provide emulation more on the silicon verification side or the sheer amount in complexity of the software for those people that are maybe more focused on the software side or those that are working in between the hardware and software in all three cases is up substantially. And I don't have to tell you that the value of over the cost of not getting to market on time because the hardware and the software done don't quite work together, it is extremely detrimental. Therefore, I expect that the investments in this area will continue and it\u2019s a very competitive market, but speaking up for Synopsys, I think we are well positioned.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the next question over to Gary Mobely with Benchmark. Please go ahead.", "Gary Mobely", "Hi everyone thanks for taking my question. Most of the questions have been asked and answered, but I did have a question about the value of M&A during 2016. I know in the past you disclosed that. I'm not sure if it was in the 10-K filing, or if it is in your supplemental materials published today, but could you share with us what the total dollar amount paid for M&A was in 2016?", "Aart De Geus ", "Well normally we don't disclose it unless it is material to the overall results. Relatively speaking it was not a super high year of M&A and maybe the best is if we get back to you later because we don't have the numbers in front of us actually.", "Gary Mobely", "Fair enough. I don't know if this is the right venue to delve into the topic deeply, but could you maybe give a quick overview on your opinion and your assessment of the likelihood of some of the proposed accounting changes in the revenue recognition issues as it impacts Synopsys?", "Trac Pham", "Hi Gary. So we\u2019ve been actively working on that over the last few years and right now we are fairly confident that we should be able to maintain the rate of a model for our business. There is obviously some details remaining to work that out and actually the implementation of that is going to be fairly complex, but for the most part we are confident that we should sustain the model.", "Gary Mobely", "Okay. Last question for me, the upfront licensing cost - I'm sorry, upfront licensing revenue that showed up as well in the IP systems and software integrity group and as well showed up in your accounts receivable with the spike there. And so, I was wondering if there were any other factors that drove up the spike in upfront besides emulation? Did you see maybe perhaps spike in IP licensing or maybe a large software integrity license deal?", "Trac Pham", "Yes the upfront, the strong upfront in Q4 were functioning both hardware and IP that was recognized on a perpetual basis or up fronts.", "Gary Mobely", "Alright. That is it from me. I appreciate you taking the questions, thanks everyone.", "Trac Pham", "Gary just a follow-up to your earlier question, the cash outflow for M&A was about 60 million for 2016.", "Gary Mobely", "Alright. Thank you.", "Aart De Geus", "I guess we are arriving\u2026sorry.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Sorry, quick one and thanks for letting me get on here. So for the revenue guidance you guys are talking about 2,585 [ph] kind of is the midpoint, that implies 4.5% growth if I take out the $50 million. So can you mirror that with your comment about mid single digit growth in Cordier, and then double digits in the IP and systems piece, because I think that would be north of around that 4.5% mark organically.", "Aart De Geus ", "Obviously there is always variability from year-to-year, remember that in 2016 we had a very strong hardware year and that is quite lumpy, so for your earlier question we want to be a bit conservative given that these things are very hard to predict. But fundamentally, I think we feel ourselves that we are coming into 2017 in a stronger position than we enter 2016. And so now of course the proof is in the putting and there is a lot of work to be done, but that sort of is the way it feels to us right now.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, got it thank you.", "Aart De Geus ", "You're welcome. Well I think we have reached the turn of the hour. So I would like to thank all of you for not only attending this earnings release, but for closing yet another year. We are thankful that we had a strong year, we are thankful to our employees, our customers, our partners, but also to you for following us and reporting on our endeavors. We are heading into 2016, 2017 with a good confidence and a lot of exciting things to do. And so we hope to have you on the next earnings call, sometime next year.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were strong. We delivered revenue of $680 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.88, both at the top of our target ranges. We executed $100 million share buyback for a total of $200 million so far this year. And we-re raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "The landscape around us is solid with what feels like a continuing stable outlook for 2017. Our 3 customer groups, semiconductors, systems companies and software developers, continue to invest significantly. This is driven by the dawning age of digital intelligence which is both exciting and evolving quickly. Everything around us is becoming smart, connected but also complex. Mounting software content, whether integrated on a chip or as an app, creates huge functionality, development and security challenges. This, in turn, drives growth opportunities around machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure and the soaring need for more cloud-based computation and storage.", "With the unique portfolio reaching from the roots of silicon all the way up to software, combined with best-in-class global support, Synopsys continues to demonstrate that our vision, strategy, investments and execution are right on the money. This is evidenced in all 3 product groups. Core EDA revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years. IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion.", "Let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with core EDA. Synopsys is a mission-critical partner for the most advanced designs. Our EDA and IP collaboration with TSMC illustrates this. During Q2, we announced full flow certification for TSMC's 12- and 7-nanometer processes as well as broad IP cooperation for 12-nanometer FinFETs. Customers today rely on Synopsys for more than 95% of their FinFET designs. Meanwhile, we-re already partnering on early R&D of 5-nanometer and below.", "Our design platform is generating solid results and notable customer successes. IC Compiler II, our place and route solution, is used on highly complex chips, some as advanced as 7-nanometer, by companies such as Xilinx, NVIDIA, ST and Broadcom. IC Validator, our physical verification product, has already performed final sign-off of more than 100 FinFET production tape-outs, a significant accomplishment given the historical reliance on competitors.", "Meanwhile, intensive R&D across our digital platform is delivering new high-impact capabilities at a very rapid pace. In custom, our long-time leadership in simulation and our new Custom Compiler design solution are generating high interest. Custom Compiler's FinFET optimizations and our close collaboration with UMC, for example, enabled customers to use Custom Compiler in their new 14-nanometer process. At our March user group conference, ST, MediaTek and Renesas shared their production successes with engineers from more than 40 companies.", "In verification, we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year. Our Verification Continuum platform is in high demand for 2 reasons, first, we have leading-edge verification technologies ranging from simulation to emulation to prototyping to static techniques to powerful, well integrated debugging; and second, our coherent platform is solidly centered at the intersection of hardware and software, the very intersection enabling Smart Everything and addressing the time-to-market urgency of this dynamic market.", "We continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast VCS simulator to platform-wide adoption and proliferation. Over the last several quarters, leading mobile, graphics and processor companies have aligned with us through expanded multi-year strategy -- strategic agreements, including simulation, verification IP, debug, formal, emulation and prototyping technologies.", "In Q2, broad demand for ZeBu emulation continued with 6 new logos and expansion in top accounts. For example, Spreadtrum standardized on ZeBu for its advanced mobile SoCs and Wave Computing adopted ZeBu for its machine learning products. While lumpy from quarter-to quarter, we expect 2017 to be another record year for hardware revenue, driven by industry demand and the robustness of our solution.", "On top of this, virtual prototyping which enables early software development and architecture assessment, resonated particularly well in the automotive market. During the quarter, we announced support for chips from Silicon Mobility Inc., a leading semiconductor provider for hybrid and electric vehicle control systems.", "Let me pause for a moment on automotive, where, over the past several years, we've deployed a wide range of targeted solutions. With touch points ranging from functional safety to autonomous driving to the next-generation of infotainment, all the way to lighting simulation, Synopsys is growing into a crucial participant in the automotive ecosystem. Elements throughout our EDA, IP and software integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety defined by the ISO 26262 standard.", "In IP, for example, over the last 8 quarters, we significantly extended our portfolio of certified IP. More broadly, in Q2, we saw strong demand in IP with particular momentum in advanced technology and security. We announced an expansive portfolio of IP for TSMC's 12 FFC process and taped out multiple 10- and 7-nanometer IP test chips with advanced foundries. We're systematically building out our portfolio of security IP for mobile, automotive, IoT and cloud computing markets. In Q2, for example, we delivered a high-performance, hardware-secure module that protects sensitive information and data processing within SoCs.", "The need for security is, of course, much broader than IP which brings me to our third customer base, software developers across many industries. The focus in our growing Software Integrity Group is to provide products and services that help developers write high-quality code that can withstand security vulnerabilities. This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions.", "Our software sign-off platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of Cigital. We're strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and well-respected expertise.", "With the acquisition of Cigital in Q1, we're accelerating penetration in other key verticals such as the financial services industry. Our objective is to drive demand creation at early stages of security strategy development. The Cigital integration is already delivering examples of our first combined services and product agreements and cross-selling opportunities.", "Finally, Synopsys was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for application security testing. The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors. We've already seen increased customer interest as a result.", "In closing, as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, our priorities remain centered on generating long term shareholder value. We do this by investing organically and through M&A and EDA, IP and software integrity to realize our Silicon to Software vision. We do this by executing with a clear intent to sustain technology leadership while simultaneously growing revenue and profitability throughout our business. And we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record, of driving ongoing high single-digit EPS growth and returning cash to shareholders.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we closed another outstanding quarter and continue to execute very well. We met or exceeded all key financial targets, delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth, completed a $100 million share buyback and generated significant cash flow. Our first half was very strong and as a result, we-re raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow.", "Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 12% to $680 million, at the high-end of our target range, with particular strength in hardware and IP. About 90% of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and 1 customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.7 years and we expect the 2017 average to be slightly less than 3 years.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $626 million which included a $38 million accrual related to the ongoing Eve-Mentor litigation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $513 million, within our target range.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6% for the quarter. For the year, we expect solid organic margin expansion over 2016, moderated by the impact of the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.88, at the high end of our target range.", "Operating cash flow was $123 million, driven by strong collections and business levels. We-re again raising our 2017 cash flow target to a range of $580 million to $600 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.1 billion with 11% onshore and total debt of $418 million.", "In Q2, we returned $100 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program and we have $235 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Before moving onto guidance, let me briefly update you on ASC 606, the new revenue recognition rules that we'll implement in fiscal 2019. We-re preparing for the rule change and are confident that our predictable model will remain substantially intact.", "Now to third quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. For Q3, the targets are, revenue between $685 million and $700 million which reflects both strength and timing of hardware sales; total GAAP cost and expenses between $574 million and $593 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $517 million and $527 million; other income between negative $1 million and $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.69 to $0.78 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 to $0.94 per share.", "For 2017, we're raising our revenue target to $2.65 billion to $2.67 billion, a growth rate of 9% to 10% which reflects underlying strength in our business, including record hardware sales; other income between $2 million and $6 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $1.84 to $1.97 per share. We're raising the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings target range by $0.03 to $3.24 to $3.29 per share, a growth rate of 7% to 9%; capital expenditures of approximately $90 million; and cash flow from operations of $580 million to $600 million.", "As we look to the remainder of 2017, we expect Q4 to be the lowest revenue and EPS quarter due to the timing of hardware shipments and seasonally higher operating expenses. Investors should expect continued variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware products and their upfront revenue recognition. Excluding hardware, our 90-10 time-based revenue model remains in effect.", "Finally, we're in the early stages of planning for next year and we'd encourage investors to wait until we've provided guidance before updating estimates. That said, we believe the current 2018 consensus non-GAAP EPS estimates look reasonable. This is consistent with our long term objective of driving high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.", "In summary, Q2 was a great quarter. We delivered strong growth across the board. We're raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow and we continue to drive long term shareholder value by investing in the business both organically and through acquisitions and by returning capital through share buybacks.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company.", "Richard Valera", "I wanted to ask about the strength you're seeing in the core EDA business. Aart, you've been on record on numerous occasions saying you thought that was kind of a low single-digit growth business, yet it looks like you're growing that close to double digits last couple of quarters. I just wanted to get your sense of what's driving that with any more color than you gave in your prepared remarks and kind of how sustainable this well above kind of industry growth rate might be.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement. Having said that, there's no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and I think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements, will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors. And you can see that the entire field is really poised to demand more computation. And so it is natural, therefore, for people to come to our products. And while there are some up and down from quarter-to quarter, they are driving the leading edge and they need the tools to support that. So I think we're fortunate to do well.", "Richard Valera", "Got it. And then just more specifically for the quarter, the service maintenance line was very strong. I'm not sure if you could give any commentary on what that was and how we should think about that line for the balance of the year.", "Trac Pham", "Rich, on -- you're referring to the P&L with the split?", "Richard Valera", "Correct.", "Trac Pham", "On the services and product line, that includes the Cigital acquisition as well as strength in underlying IP, right? That's where the PoC revenues flow through as well.", "Richard Valera", "But was that -- that was an unusually strong quarter. Should we think about that as a [indiscernible] ?", "Trac Pham", "No, IP tends to be pretty lumpy, but we-re doing -- if you look at the results from a product mix, we-re doing well in IP. But it does tend to be lumpy and then you add that to the Cigital acquisition where we've got a full quarter of that now. That's driving a quarter-on quarter change.", "Richard Valera", "Got it. So higher than historical levels but maybe not quite that high going forward. That makes sense.", "Trac Pham", "Yes. We keep it in -- as we said publicly, the -- we expect IP to go grow in the double-digit rate and it could be lumpy from quarter-to quarter. But our goal is to drive that growth sustainably in the double digits.", "Richard Valera", "Got it. And then just with respect to hardware you've obviously had a great run of demand here in hardware and it looks like Q3, probably not expecting any different, but you're currently modeling it, sounds like, for Q4 to maybe see a -- take a breather in hardware. Is that something you really have visibility to? Or is that just out of an abundance of caution? Just trying to get a sense of how much visibility you actually have to that Q4 sales hardware?", "Aart de Geus", "It feels like repetitive in the last 3 or 4 earnings releases. We must have used the word hardware is lumpy every time and that is an indication that the visibility is not complete, meaning that some of these things come in and then the customer wants immediate fulfillment or delayed fulfillment. So the timing can be somewhat arbitrary. There's no question that we have done well in the hardware area and I think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together. And that is only a center of strength for Synopsys.", "Trac Pham", "Rich, you bring up a good point in terms of Q4. The profile of Q4 is impacted by the variability of hardware. As you've seen in the results across geos, across product mixes, we're doing well. And going forward, you'll see more variability quarter-on quarter. So I think focus on the full year. And just as you brought up, the Q4 profile is down, but that's just mostly on hardware.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson.", "Thomas Diffely", "First, I was curious what are the specific drivers of the hardware IP. Is it the core semi business, the system players or perhaps new customers in Asia?", "Aart de Geus", "Actually, the first two groups because in order for emulation and other hardware isolation methods to be useful, it is really in the proximity of the intersection of hardware and software which means it's the high-end chips that invariably drive a lot of software or it is the systems companies that integrate multiple chips around building apps or building entire product. And so the distinction between semiconductor vendors and system vendors sometimes is a little blurred because they tend to increasingly do stuff for each other or demand from each other that, that sits at this intersection. So both of those, I think, sort of grow hand in hand.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. And then on the IP side, [indiscernible] the new customers are looking to fast track some designs now.", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. Actually, sorry I forgot that part of your question. IP is directly related to efficiency and productivity. And with continuous complexity of chips and by the way, continued complexity of the IP blocks, delayed collection of these blocks just continues to grow and the efficiency with which people can put together large chips is directly a function of which blocks are available, how easy is it to integrate them and how much do you trust the vendor because, obviously, you're highly relying on who provides you those blocks. And so as companies design large chips or larger systems, increasingly, they put their engineers on those aspects that they can't purchase but where they can provide additional differentiation while outsourcing increasingly blocks that, in the past, they would have done themselves. And I think that bodes very well for us.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. So for both of those groups, too, have you begun to see any kind of a seasonality pattern with them? Or is purely just project based and can be fairly random through the year?", "Aart de Geus", "I have not seen any seasonality. I think it is very much project based and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out what's going to be in the project, they would like to have the IP the next day which, of course, not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets. But the projects come and go. The companies have no aligned time line for these projects and so I don't see any seasonality. But one could have the configuration that, for some reason, there are some quarter, there are more project finishing than others or deliveries that we could do. So it could be somewhat lumpy, but it's not because of seasonality.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. And then moving over to the core EDA market. Are the tools, the software tools now ready, completely ready for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes? Or are there still challenges to be overcome?", "Aart de Geus", "They are completely ready for the 7-nanometer. 5-nanometer is not on the market and 5-nanometer is still in deep development. That will take a little while. And even when I say for the 7-nanometer -- 7-nanometer is really leading edge and what that means is that the foundries that provide the technology and that manufacture these chips will keep refining their technology on ongoing basis because they constantly are trying to tune the yields that they get because if you have a little higher yields, meaning a higher percentage of chips that work on a wafer, that has enormous economic impact. And so we-re in constant interaction with foundries. Every time that they tune it a little bit, we tune our tools and in some cases, we also tune our IP a little further.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. And in your answer, they do include the IP and the 7-nanometers being ready as well?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, we have a number of efforts in these advanced nodes and the word ready is not a black and white, meaning that there are certain things that are already earlier. There are certain things that are already with 7-nanometers, not quite there, for test chips, for example. And so there's a very complex multi-year process to bring something to market. But from my commentary, you should read that we-re well exercised in trying to align as much as possible with the foundry train so that we arrive at the station at the same time.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. And does your answer there either include or not include EUV? Does it matter to you?", "Aart de Geus", "It doesn't matter that much. There are some very fundamental IP that's impacted by EUV. And as you may know, EUV is sort of now just slowly seeping into potentially some production manufacturing in the coming years and that is only for a few layers of the chip. And there are many, many layers, so EUV will be for the very refined ones initially. And so we're well on top of that, but it does not mean a big effort nor a big issue.", "Thomas Diffely", "Okay. And then finally, Trac, you said that the accounting rule changes should have just not much impact on your model. If you were to see the impact, where would it be?", "Trac Pham", "There are some portions of it in the IP business that could be affected and fortunately, we have got time to work through how to structure those contracts. And then there's a small portion on some elements of FSAs related to the software contracts, the FSAs being the equivalent to gift cards that you buy certain amount and then draw down over time. Those things will be challenging as we work through the rules, but fortunately, we know what they are. And they're relatively small portion and we've got some time to address them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Sreekrishnan Sankar", "I had a few more easy questions for you, Aart. Number one, on your IP business, can you guys say how much of it is actually ratable versus upfront?", "Trac Pham", "Roughly 60% is ratable.", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. Just to clarify, when we do IP, people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form, maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology. And so this is why the IP is accompanied by a statement of work which can be viewed essentially as a service business. But it is service business around an existing product. And the reason you saw us hesitate is because we rarely think about it in those 2 categories. But it is a good question. It is sort of a balance between the 2.", "Sreekrishnan Sankar", "Got it. That's really helpful. And then a couple of other ones. Obviously, there's been a lot of chatter about activity in China on their own semiconductor investment front. Have you guy started seeing any purchases for EDA tools from the indigenous Chinese companies?", "Aart de Geus", "Yes, we have seen those since like the middle 1990s. We've been in China for a long, long time and they have been, for now many, many years, many design companies. Many have not been successful. And so I would say, we're at least already on the third or fourth generation of companies where a bunch have disappeared, reconfigured and so on. And now there is a significant segment of strong Chinese companies that are -- that have, year after year, become closer and closer to be at the state of the art and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely state-of-the-art silicon technology. And so they have been broad users of our tools. China has been a growing market for us and we continue to see expansion of that market.", "Trac Pham", "Krish [indiscernible] doing well across our entire portfolio. So we've been doing -- selling EDA in China for a long time as Aart described it. IP is a very good opportunity and we've seen growth there. And then even with the Software Integrity business, that's been emerging over the last few years as well.", "Sreekrishnan Sankar", "Okay. All right. Let me -- I'm going to try to ask the question a different way then. If I look at, historically, for Synopsys, memory has been about 15% to 20% of your business and China has this huge plan to get into like memory with new 3D NAND factories. And from those customers, have you actually started seeing any -- are you guys having any conversation with this new 3D NAND investment in China? Or have you guys started seeing any early POs or anything of that nature?", "Aart de Geus", "Definitely yes. I mean, memory development is development that requires pretty deep understanding of semiconductor physics and device construction. And so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those, you're absolutely right that, in the last recent period, I would say maybe last 2 years, there has been an increase in attention and effort. And that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about, that the big data will be analyzed and therefore, the -- be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it, are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing. And so in that sense, while China may be new to this game, the push in new memory technologies is quite interesting and that fits well the overall picture of a semiconductor business that is going to be an enabler to many other high-tech capabilities.", "Sreekrishnan Sankar", "Got you. Got you. And then the final question I had is if I look at your fiscal first half or the last 2 quarters, your R&D as a percent of your sale, it's kind of been running at the low end of your historical range. I'm curious to know, is that the new fundamental shift on how you're going to be more effective with your R&D? Or are 2 quarters just not too big a data point to like extrapolate?", "Trac Pham", "I wouldn't extrapolate off of 2 quarters. I think what you're seeing in first half is mostly the acceleration of revenues. We expect to maintain R&D investments in the 30%-ish range. And depending on how -- what you're seeing this year is just the lumpiness of revenues and the quarterly profile will skew that. But overall, we expect to maintain the model in that 30% range.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "I'm wondering, with the acquisition of Cigital on top of all the other elements that you've pieced together in some of the software assurance, et cetera, how much of your sales and marketing headcount is now focused outside the core kind of systems and semiconductor industries.", "Aart de Geus", "Good question. I don't know the exact answer, but I can venture that it is probably half to a little bit more as outside. And the reason for that is that the marketing needed in our core semiconductor space is not that high because we have many very good connections and we can relatively easily access people that need security and quality tools for their software. Whereas in the rest of the space, there are many different market segments. And you mentioned Cigital which is a really interesting acquisition because it's not only that it brings to us a service business, that allows us to engage at a higher level with customers that are looking at the strategy of their -- of how to deal with quality and security. It is that they're also very strong in the financial market. ", "And so the way you communicate with financial market is very different than, let's say, the health market or the embedded software market and that is why some marketing effort has to be specialized on that. From a sales point of view, there, it is much more a question of global access and how quickly can we grow this and be in a situation where we have high-quality salespeople. And that is an ongoing effort and going well. We're growing well, but there's no end to that one yet.", "Sterling Auty", "And then on the IP business, you mentioned the strength that you're seeing there. We look at the gross margins. Obviously, the gross margins relative to expectations was probably heavily influenced on the mix. But specifically to the IP, how would you characterize the gross margin contribution at this point and the thoughts of where that could trend?", "Trac Pham", "Sure. This is Trac. The margins on that are pretty healthy, but directionally, they're slightly below the corporate average. And that's about where we'd expect to drive that.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then last question, you mentioned 606 on a couple of areas, but I didn't hear one of the attributes of 606 is the backlog disclosure. Any thoughts around the structure of how you're going to disclose the backlog? And specifically, I know it has to be done quarterly, but there is the commentary that goes with it describing how you go from backlog into revenue. Is there any conclusions at this point in terms of how that would be -- how those disclosures will come?", "Trac Pham", "No. We're still assessing that, but I would say that we've done a pretty good job disclosing backlog in the past. And the metrics that we provided, I think, gives investors a pretty good sense of the health of the business. Going into any particular year, we do aim for about 80% visibility of backlog, scheduled revenue in backlog at the end of the year. Secondly, we try to enter the quarter -- each quarter with about 90% of backlog in hand. So I think those 2 metrics combined with anything else we provide should give pretty good color on the health of the business.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Trac, let me start with you. You raised the midpoint of your cash flow expectation for the year by $80 million. Is that pretty broadly based in terms of numbers of customers driving that? Or is it fairly narrowly based in terms of perhaps there's a small number of customers with a large amount of collections driving that number? And then secondly, for you, before I turn to Aart, given the scaling that you're seeing now in hardware, could you comment on the margin or mix trends vis-\u00e0-vis hardware profitability?", "Trac Pham", "Okay. Let me start first with the broad -- the cash flow, whether it's broad based. It was, yes, definitely broad based and that would be consistent with the health of the business that we're seeing in the first half. As I mentioned, when you look across, the growth was pretty broad based across geographies and product mixes. So that -- the cash flow is consistent with that. And then from a hardware perspective, we-re definitely doing well with hardware revenues and the profitability on that certainly is improving and it is [indiscernible] profits.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Is it improving as a percentage of the hardware revenue?", "Trac Pham", "Yes.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Okay. For Aart, a couple of things for you. We often hear over the years from EDA companies when new hardware is introduced, particularly emulation of course, detailed descriptions about the hardware specifications and most particularly about the design capacity that the hardware systems are capable of. We don't typically hear that sort of discussion around the software tool capacity. And this issue has come up for you and others over the years in terms of design size capacity that you could put through, DC, for example and the issues of that kind. As you move now to 10-nanometer and below, could you talk about whether or not there are any capacity issues that you need to resolve for any role of your tools to adequately handle the design sizes that you're likely to see? You mentioned new version of VCS, so perhaps that's one example.", "But anything you can address with regard to the capacity on the software side would be helpful. And then lastly for you on the technology front, are you beginning to see any kind of conjoined usage of your prototyping hardware with software integrity, in other words, is the software to bring out capability of hardware being used somehow with the Software Integrity business? And then similarly, is the prototyping business being used increasingly along with emulation as part of your Verification Continuum?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, so for being at Synopsys for 30 years, I would say our capacity has always been less than the customer wanted and more than they thought they would get, meaning that the state of the art is limited typically by a few things which is, one, is how fast can you run; and two, how much can you run at the same time. And so it has been actually quite remarkable how, over all this time period, these numbers have continued to increase. And I'm certainly on record of having argued many times that we-re the other half of Moore's Law which is if they can manufacture it, we will find a way to simulate it, to design it and so on and that goes hand in hand. But for the most state-of-the-art situations, one has always had the limit of what one can do. The second comment I would have for that, it is quite remarkable how, over all these years, over and over, there have been redesigns of architecture of utilization of compute environments, of utilization of multiple computers, multiple cores, multiple threads that have managed to keep your question in check.", "So we're always chasing the horizon in other words and this is true on the hardware side in emulation or prototyping. It is certainly true for software for a long time. And expect that to absolutely continue and we will stay at the leading edge of that. Secondly, regarding the intersection of prototyping and software integrity, I expect that we're going to start seeing some of that in the not-too-distant future. So far, there's not been a lot of evidence of that, but we have not really pushed on that front yet either. The intersection between prototyping of emulation, we have already seen quite a bit of that. And by the way, it's intersection of prototyping, emulation and simulation and in some cases, even virtual prototyping. And that is because the system people would like to simulate software on larger systems that have many components that may be defined at different levels of abstraction. So all of this is being done. I don't want to give the impression that this is routinely easy. This is sophisticated stuff. But we-re in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems.", "Operator", "Okay and our next question will come from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.", "Monika Garg", "First, just if I look at your guidance, even if you've modeled the high end of revenue guidance, since Q4, you were guiding almost $50 million down Q-over-Q. Historically, your Q4 is at least flattish to modestly up. So what is leading to such high kind of revenue down Q-over-Q? Or is it just you're being conservative?", "Trac Pham", "No, Monika, it's really the hardware business. As we mentioned, it will vary from quarter-to quarter. The underlying -- outside of hardware, the business -- all the other businesses are doing well, so it's not offsetting anything. But hardware is driving the quarter-on quarter comparison.", "Monika Garg", "$50 million?", "Trac Pham", "I'm sorry?", "Monika Garg", "So the downside is about $50 million, 5-0. The others are up.", "Aart de Geus", "We have very strong hardware business.", "Monika Garg", "Okay. And a similar point, your operating margins, if I have to model for the guidance, it's going to be like 17%, again, down like almost 700, 800 basis points year-over-year and Q-over-Q. Hardware is down. Operating margin should be better, right?", "Trac Pham", "As we mentioned at the earlier comments, expenses are seasonally up in Q4, so we've got the offset of revenues coming down because of the hardware trend and the expenses going up in Q4.", "Monika Garg", "All right. Then, can you just remind us how big your software security business now? And when do you expect it to be breakeven?", "Trac Pham", "Well, as we mentioned last -- in previous calls, we were guiding to about $100 million last year which we met and a -- the overall growth in that business is about 20% which is tracking, too. And then Cigital, when we acquired them, was roughly half of the existing business. And then the underlying business, we mentioned that the acquisitions would be dilutive to earnings this year and would affect margins. But on the classic software integrity business, we-re on track to do breakeven at second half of the year.", "Monika Garg", "All right. Then, going forward, what is the growth rate you expect in the software security business, including the Cigital acquisition?", "Trac Pham", "We're looking at the 20% range.", "Monika Garg", "Okay. Then, Aart, we saw like, over the weekend, a big security breach. Could you maybe talk about how this could impact the security -- software security business? Have you seen any...", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. For starters, we're fortunate that our own processes around upgrading our firewalls, of making sure that all of the patches have been applied to software have been effective, so we have not had any issues with this. Very clearly, every time there is a big story, in this case, massive number of stories, the attention level around the notion of security goes up. And we-re sitting in the space where the idea is to design security in the first place, not to just fix all the things that went wrong in the past but make it essentially correct by construction. And so from that perspective, I think we-re in a very healthy situation. If you amend that by the fact that Gartner which tracks many, many security-related companies such as ourselves, are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do, obviously, the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if it's negative for the world and so we-re seeing that with the acquisition of Cigital, with the commentary that Trac just gave you on the existing business.", "I feel that we can now state that this business has, for lack of better term, reached critical mass. And what I mean with that is that a number of years ago, we made the decision to move up from the silicon to the software. We made a decision to bank beyond the hardware and software intersection and that, moreover, this new TAM that touches many companies that, in the past, we have no business with looks very promising. There were many execution challenges in getting there. I think we've navigated well through those. And I'm very encouraged with where we-re in the middle of 2017 because we see this vision materializing. And hopefully, it's not on the back of catastrophes around us but more on the premise that building correctly for the future is really where the software industry should go and that is where our contribution will be.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Then, the new administration has talked about making it easy for cash repatriation. If that happens, how could you think about the usage of cash?", "Trac Pham", "Monika, we-re staying on top on what's developing as far as tax reform in the U.S. If it does occur, I mean, obviously, we -- I think when you use cash the same way we've been using over the last several years. Over the last, trailing 12 -- 4 quarters, we've bought back close to $400 million in stock. We've acquired companies in the software integrity space and we'll continue to use the cash to drive growth in terms of acquisitions and then return cash when it's appropriate via buybacks.", "Monika Garg", "Last one for me on IP, growing double digit. Is double digit the right way to look at going forward? And then you've been building ADAS IP for autos for some time. Are you seeing inflection in that?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for the first part of your question, yes, we think that it is in the low double digits. So far, the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips, our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there. I'm sorry, I couldn't acoustically hear your second part of the question.", "Monika Garg", "You've been building the ADAS IP for autos for some time. Maybe are you seeing inflection in that?", "Aart de Geus", "Oh, yes, sure, sorry. Yes, automotive has been an interesting area because it's having so much attention, frankly, by a whole number of people that may create a bit of a bubble there. But at the same time, there's a good reason it's getting so much attention which is it is the showcase for what modern hardware software will be able to do to fundamentally transform a field that has been relatively slow in evolving. It is now evolving very, very rapidly. And so we have invested quite a bit over the last few years not only to make sure that the tools are capable of dealing with this type of designs, but our IP portfolio has grown significantly in the realm of having certified IP.", "And certification of IP is for one key reason which is automotive demands a certain set of checks to make sure that what you're doing is actually safe. And in the past, safety has been actually developed quite well in automotive. With this very, very rapid increase of both hardware and software, the complexity that comes with that is going to be a challenge for safety and the fact that we have a portfolio that is now massively certified, I think, bodes very well for our position there.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mitchell Steves", "Two questions for you if I could. First for Aart. Just in terms of the core EDA business, that's continuing to grow at double digits now. So I know you guys have talked to low to mid-single growth. But what exactly has changed there? I mean, I know the CAD business or the CAD industry to be growing faster. Could you maybe highlight some changes that have happened over the past year or so?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, one of the key pieces is that the intersection of hardware and software has been driving verification extremely hard and a subcategory to that is really emulation and prototyping. We refer to that as hardware. And that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they don't have and so instead, they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like. And I expect that to continue because if you want to go to market, you want to start the software development as soon as you possibly can and make sure that it's going to work with the hardware that takes a long time to manufacture. So that has really been one of the key variables in this game.", "Mitchell Steves", "Got it. And then secondly for Trac on the financial side. I'm having a hard time getting to the kind of Q4 EPS because if I look historically, typically from Q3 to Q4, your total expenses go up by $20 million or so but in order to get to the new midpoint that the full year guide implies, if you're going to be $30 million plus or a 50% increase, so I guess, what's kind of in the financial model for Q4 that's abnormal from the past?", "Trac Pham", "Well, normally, the -- as you highlighted, the expenses do ramp up from Q3 to Q4. What we would normally see this year is an increase in hiring. That's per our plan. You would see a ramp-up in variable comp as we accrue for where we think we're going to end up the year. And then, historically, the numbers I think -- well, we can model with you, offline, but your historical numbers in terms of growth might be a little aggressive. And then the offset to that is how you model the Q3 revenue to Q4 profile, but we can work with you afterwards.", "Operator", "Okay. And we have no further questions in queue and we do have 5 minutes remaining. I'll turn it back to the executive board.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, thank you very much for attending this earnings release. Hopefully, you took away that we had a very strong quarter, that the outlook for the coming quarter is strong, the overall year is looking extremely solid. But most importantly, I think the alignment around our Silicon to Software strategy appears to be working quite well and all the individual businesses have contributed strongly to our present success. So with the intent to continue on that trajectory, we thank you for your support and attention.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Davidson", "Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities", "Monika Garg - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2017. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Ernie, and good afternoon. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release.", "We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to announce that Synopsys completed another outstanding quarter. Last October, we entered fiscal 2017 with expectations for solid revenue, earnings, and cash flow. As a result of excellent execution and robust customer demand, we\u2019re on track to substantially exceed those expectations for the year.", "For Q3, we posted revenue of $695 million, with good growth across all product groups, most notably hardware and IP. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92, and we generated $280 million in operating cash flow. We completed our thirdmerchandise share buyback of 2017 for a total of $300 million so far this year. Lastly, we\u2019re raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "As we look at the dynamics of the three customer groups we serve; semiconductors, systems companies, and software developers, I would characterize the environment as exciting, visionary, and intensely competitive. The age of smart everything, some call it, digital intelligence is here. Following the decades driven by computation and mobility, we viewed Smart Everything as the third major wave of electronics impact.", "In verticals, such as automotive, medical devices, virtual reality, and industrial applications, big data and machine learning are quickly becoming familiar terms and early results are promising. This is good news for the semi-industry, as these techniques require more and more compute power, cloud storage, and networking infrastructure to support massive data, complex software, and to add one more challenge, the imperative of security.", "Synopsys is uniquely placed at this vital intersection of hardware and software. Through our IP and design platform, we enable faster, lower power, and denser silicon chips. Through our verification and software integrity offerings, we make possible the verification of hardware/software systems and the optimization of software for security and quality.", "From a business perspective, we\u2019ve successfully grown and broadened Synopsys by building the leading position in EDA, a highly successful IP business group and by branching out into the larger adjacent TAM of software security and quality. In this context, let me provide some highlights for the quarter. Companies continue to prioritize aggressive adoption of advanced silicon, while relying heavily on Synopsys.", "The evolution and use of FinFET technology continues to progress rapidly, with total designs reaching well over 500. From 16, 14, 12, 10, down to 7-nanometer, Synopsys is involved in 95% of designs through our design platform. For designs below 20-nanometer, our VCS verification is the primary simulator used in nearly 90% of chips, and we\u2019re very pleased with the growth of our emulation of prototyping solutions.", "In IP, we continued to deliver the largest catalog of IP titles now rapidly becoming available down to 7-nanometer through close collaboration with the leading silicon providers. Enabling the astounding next-generation of 5, 3, and 2-nanometer technology nodes, our TCAD lets our customer partners create upfront process and transistor modeling, while giving us early access insights towards readying our design tools for new nodesmerchandise .", "In this rapidly advancing and highly competitive semiconductor market, our design platform drove solid business in Q3. From synthesis to place and route to signoff to physical verification, we\u2019re engaged in the world\u2019s most critical designs. In Q3, we announced qualification for Samsung\u2019s 8- and 7-nanometer LPP, low power processes, as well as Global Foundries 7-nanometer FinFET node.", "At the Design Automation Conference, HiSiliconmerchandise , Renesas, Samsung, and Qualcomm presented details of their successes on very demanding digital circuits ranging from 14 to 7 nanometer. In custom design, ST, TDK-Micronas, and Panasonic highlighted the significant benefits they\u2019ve realized with custom compiler, while TSMC showcased their certification collaboration with us around their 7-nanometer technology.", "Some comments now on verification, where we again delivered excellent growth. Our verification continuum platform, essentially the fusion of best-in-class software and hardware products into an integrated differentiated solution is ideally placed at the intersection of semiconductors and systems customers.", "Semiconductor customers want to verify that their chips implement the functionality dictated by the systems house\u2019s software requirements. Meanwhile, the systems companies want to debug and optimize their software to run on the most advanced chips being designed by their semiconductor suppliers. These companies share common pressure points and time-to-market demands and growing complexity.", "Synopsys\u2019 verification solution provides the bridge between the two. Over the past three quarters, technical advances have delivered substantial growth in formal verification, verification IP, and our newest VCS generation, which is rapidly proliferating its new fine-grained parallel simulation.", "Hardware verification product had a record Q3 and are delivering another excellent year. For example, in emulation, ZeBu was selected by Konica Minolta as their standard hardware platform for verification and early software bring up of their multifunction printer designs. In FPGA prototyping, MediaTek standardized on our HAPS-80 for their next-generation SoCs motivated by its scalability and performance.", "Moving to IP where we continue to generate strong results including excellent growth in the quarter. In Q3, we further expanded our market-leading interface portfolio by introducing complete solutions for the CCIX and HBM2merchandise standards. In addition, our IP continues its rapid adoption into the most advanced process technologies, including 7- and 10-nanometer processes.", "We see strong demand for our embedded vision processor and announced a new generation that quadruples the performance of our Neural Network Engine. Interest is coming from ADAS, video surveillance, and general AI applications. We also continued to expand our IP ecosystem with the partnership with Morpho to optimize their machine-learning scene recognition technology for our embedded vision processor.", "Now to software integrity, where we focus on security and quality testing tools, as well as services for software developers in many industries. While our traditional system customers are a prime growth opportunity for us, given increasing embedded software complexity and an acute need for security, the number of companies who develop and rely on software as a critical component of their business is much larger than an EDA and IP.", "The compounding challenges of exponentially increasing software complexity and the growing risks and cost of defects associated with data safety, security, and privacy affect companies across the Board. This need is clearly visible in verticals such as medical devices, financial institutions, automotive, aerospace, and industrials.", "At Synopsys, we\u2019re focused on the software development process and are making excellent progress. In Q3, we announced key updates to our software integrity platform included expanded language and industry standards coverage. We\u2019re pleased with the Q1 acquisition of Cigital, which adds high-value security consulting, enabling earlier, more strategic discussions at the CIO and CSO levels of our customers.", "The recognition of Synopsys in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant combined with Cigital\u2019s consulting practice is generating new interest, new business and growing brand recognition. At the popular Black Hat Security Industry Conference in July, which drew more than 15,000 attendees, the number of enquires by current and potential customers quadruples over last year to more than 2,000.", "From a financial perspective, we\u2019re also executing well. And while still in the early stages of scaling this part of the business, we\u2019ve reached critical math and are enthusiastic about its potential. Earlier I mentioned, the opportunities in the vertical spaces for software security and quality. Many companies are impacted by security worries, while simultaneously raising towards the promise of Smart Everything.", "Automotive is a prime high visibility example of this. And is a vertical market that touches almost everything that Synopsys does, ranging from TCABs to optical, to FinFET design to IP, to verification to hardware/software prototyping, all the way to code security and quality.", "Automotive stands out because of its sophisticated supply chain from OEMs to Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, but also because of its complex standards and in guaranteeing safety. Our influence in business here is evolving in many ways, including increasing verification growth at leading car companies; new capabilities in our simulation tools for reliability of automotive chips; competitive wins at automotive lighting software; a growing number of businesses wins for our 16 and 7-nanometer IP, that is qualified for the most stringent automotive safety and reliability standards, all the way to active leadership with the Society of Automotive Engineers cybersecurity task force focused on setting new standards for software security.", "In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Our strategy increasingly demonstrates the value of our rationale, the investments we\u2019ve made over the years are paying off. Near-term, our strong products and customer relationships in EDA and IP are leading to very good revenue and EPS growth.", "Longer-term, our expansion into the new software security and quality TAM is showing great promise.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. For the first three quarters of 2017, we\u2019ve executed very well across the Board, driving strong financial performance and reinforcing the confidence we have in our future. in Q3, we delivered double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and generated significant operating cash flow.", "In addition, we repurchased $100 million of stock and continue to invest strategically to drive long-term growth and profitability. As we enter the final quarter of the year, we re confident in our outlook and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance. As I talk to you specific results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless in specify otherwise.", "Total revenue increased 13% to $695 million, driven by solid performance across all product groups, led by hardware and IP. About 90% of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. Largely because of record hardware sales, upfront revenue was greater than 10% of the total. Investors should expect continued variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware products and their upfront revenue recognition. Excluding hardware, our revenue model remains at approximately 90% timebase.", "The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.5 years and we expect the 2017 average to be somewhat less than three years. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $590 million and total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $521 million, within our target range.", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the quarter. For the year, we expect solid organic margin expansion over 2016, moderated by the impact of the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share were $0.75 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92. We generated $280 million of operating cash flow, driven by strong collections in business levels.", "We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for the $1.3 billion and total debt of $436 million. We have repurchased $300 million of stock so far this year and have $500 million remaining on our current authorization.", "Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. As we indicated in May, due primarily to the timing of hardware revenue and seasonally higher expenses, we expect Q4 to be the lightest quarter of the year. Q4 targets are, revenue between $642 million and $657 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $586 million and $602 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $535 million and $545 million, other income between negative $1 million, our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.33 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 to $0.58 per share.", "For 2017, we are raising our revenue target range to $2.67 billion to $2.685 billion, a growth rate of 10% to 11%, other Income between $4 million and $6 million, our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $1.92 to $1.99 per share. We\u2019re also raising the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings target range by $0.03 to $3.29 to $3.32 per share, a growth rate of 9% to 10%, capital expenditures of approximately $90 million, and cash flow from operations of $580 million to $600 million.", "Finally, we are still preparing our 2018 budget and would suggest it\u2019s premature to change your 2018 estimates until we provide detailed guidance in late November. Having said that, we believe the current 2018 consensus non-GAAP EPS estimates look reasonable. This is consistent with our long-term objective of driving high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.", "In summary, we\u2019re executing very well on our goal to maximize long-term shareholder value. We substantially increased our 2017 targets compared to initial expectations, reflecting good growth across the board with particular strength in hardware. We continue to prudently invest in our next wave of growth, software integrity, while simultaneously driving ongoing EDA and IP growth and profitability.", "And lastly, in the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we have returned $300 million of capital to shareholders through our stock buyback program.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question, the question about the software integrity group. Can you give us some color on where the revenue stands? I know, you\u2019ve been talking about how it\u2019s been about 5% of the total revenue mix, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s plus or minus 100 basis points or so, but could you give us a sense of where we\u2019re at on a run rate, excuse me, for the full-year?", "Trac Pham", "Hi, Gary, this is Trac. We\u2019re pretty pleased with how we\u2019re dealing with the Software Integrity business this year. Let me remind you some of the commentary merchandise we provided at the beginning of the year. Last year, we ended the year for software integrity at about $100 million, and our goal was to get that business to break-even this year and grow at about 20%.", "When we completed the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, we mentioned that it was roughly half of that \u2013 the exiting software integrity business. And today, when we look at the results, we\u2019re certainly tracking to the plans that we have laid out, and profitability is trending pretty much to plan, and then as we look forward on these \u2013 the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, our goal is to get that to break-even probably in the second-half of next year.", "Gary Mobley", "Thanks, about a $170 million in revenue this year, or at least annualized?", "Trac Pham", "In that range, yes.", "Gary Mobley", "Gotcha. Okay. I did notice your merchandise U.S.-based cash is at a record low in terms of the percentage of the overall cash, and just wondering if that presents a problem with respect to your capital allocation plans?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I certainly don\u2019t feel that waymerchandise . For the quarter, we did end with a cash balance that\u2019s lower than it\u2019s been over the last few quarters. But cash flow continues to be very healthy in general as we mentioned in the Q3 results. And our forecast for the year still shows very healthy cash flows.", "From a cash \u2013 from a debt perspective, we have about $280 million outstanding on the line of credit with a capacity to go to $650 million, so we feel like we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in terms of managing our capital allocation similar to prior quarters. I think, just to reiterate, the way that we used our U.S. cash this quarter was a combination of the buybacks, which typically comes out of U.S. cash, and then the geo mixmerchandise was a little bit different than it was in prior quarters.", "Gary Mobley", "Last question, if memory serves me correct, do you \u2013 you haven\u2019t really done a whole lot of M&A in the last couple of quarters, and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s reflective of potential merchandise targets expecting too much, or if it\u2019s anything indicative of how you want to use your cash?", "Trac Pham", "Well, remember, that in in Q1, we acquired Cigital. And so that was a very important acquisition. And if you were to look at our history over many years or how should I say, many decades, you would see that that there is quite a degree of randomness when things get acquired in close for the very simple reason that, while we may have very solid strategic plans on what we do, we have a very little control for when things become available or for sale and even the closing process has many imponderables.", "Having said that, so we have not changed our fundamental strategy, which is we invest strongly in our own R&D, because that is a very good way to continue innovation and typically provides very good return on investment. And at the same time, we don\u2019t hesitate to bring in forces from outside, be it for technology reasons or for market position regions. And in the case of the sync business, we have been quite successful so far. And I dare to say, it\u2019s probably not over yet.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay. I appreciate the comments. Thanks, everyone.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next go to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. Aart, it\u2019s kind of a big picture question for you. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the potential incremental spending by systems and particularly Web 2.0 companies that are developing their own hardware that these companies that didn\u2019t exist, say, 10, 15 years ago. But then, you also have companies like Apple that have kind of taken a lot of semiconductor design inside, so they\u2019re designing a lot more, but at the same time they\u2019ve kind of depleted their supply chain.", "But I just want to get your sense of how incremental you see the new system companies, particularly Web 2.0 companies to the overall EDA spending pie, if you will?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for starters merchandise , I think, they\u2019re very interesting, because of course, that is the center of gravity of where the action is in turning electronics into the next wave of massive impact on the world. Now, these are the companies that do two things at the same time. They have algorithms that are really quite revolutionarily new and practical in the AI space, and then at the same time they continually explore would there be benefits to have hardware that is more specialized, dedicated, or optimize for exactly that.", "I think the jury is very much out in terms of how many of those companies and which ones would go how far? Again, I know I gave you a lot of questions here, how far into doing their own design, but what is absolutely clear is that, in many situations, they do just the top-end of design, as it is relevant to verify that their software will be able to run very well on it.", "And of course, we are privileged to be very often in the middle of that story via the very rapid, the prototyping and emulation. But we\u2019re also increasingly in that story by virtue of being close to everything that needs to now be secured. And so we have a lot of interactions with companies that in the past we either had only marginal interaction with, but now are really the drivers for the future.", "Now some of these people also rely on semiconductor companies to be their partner. And so then we get to see a little bit more of the value chain, I mentioned, automotive as a good example of that.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. And I guess, relatedly, you\u2019ve had a pretty fantastic run in hardware. And it sounds like it\u2019s sort of dual PROM there on both the emulation and the FPGA prototyping side. And I know you early to those to make predictions here. But so I just want to get a sense of how you view that business on maybe sort of a medium-term basis in terms of the growth outlook? And would you distinguish between emulation and the FPGA prototyping in terms of potential growth rates, if you give any color on that? Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the way to respond is, it is not \u2013 it\u2019s not a dual PROM, it\u2019s more a triple or quadruple, because when you look at the verification platform,. other techniques such as the software simulation, the debugging and static techniques, they all play together with emulation and the FPGA. And that platform is becoming more and more solid. And that\u2019s relevant, because even if you have super fast emulation, if you find an issue and you cannot track down what it is, your debugging becomes the bottleneck of success.", "Having said that, there\u2019s a reason why we have been cautioning you about drawing a straight line on the whole hardware side of our business, because it\u2019s very lumpy. It comes in fairly large increments and those increments are not always predictable. Even if in the long-term, we\u2019re actually a strong believer that that there\u2019s continued good growth in that area. And we certainly continue to invest well in that and the technologies are very promising.", "Lastly, yes, you mentioned, yes, we don\u2019t really make that much of a difference between the FPGA boards and the emulator. They\u2019re really two sides of the same spectrum, which is essentially used hardware to massively accelerate some software function and both are doing quite well.", "Rich Valera", "Fair enough. And one final one for me, I think, this is for Trac. Trac, when you talked about your model this time, you basically said, you see it as 90% ratable going forward, excluding hardware. And I\u2019m not sure, I think, that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve used that language, excluding hardware, obviously, hardware is a part of the mix for quite awhile here. Is that new language? And do we think this is, because hardware is likely to be a bigger percentage of the mix on an ongoing basis than it has been historically?", "Aart de Geus", "Hi, Rich, it really wasn\u2019t meant to be a deliberate change in the messaging. We just want to highlight that it was an extremely strong quarter. The results are really solid, which was driven largely by hardware much like the year has been. And we just want to highlight that if there\u2019s any concerns about the rest of the business have we changed the business model and the rest of the business we haven\u2019t. I think, we said that early in the year as well, so it\u2019s a pretty consistent message.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. Okay, thanks very much, gentlemen.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome, Rich.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Tom Diffely", "Yes, good afternoon. I\u2019d like to follow-up on Rich\u2019s questions on the system customers. So do you think that the growth over the last few years was stronger, greater than you expect the growth to be over the next few years. I mean, we kind of gone past the peak growth of that new market?", "Aart de Geus", "No, I think for that part of the markets the changes are all ahead of us in terms of the impact on literally, virtually every products in the world. We coined the term Smart Everything, because that\u2019s really what we mean. Meaning that, there are so many areas from services to hard products to infrastructure and so on that all will benefit from this emerging wave of artificial intelligence very much rooted in the combination of big data and machine learning. And I think we\u2019re just touching the tip of the iceberg in terms of its impact.", "Now that doesn\u2019t mean that instantaneously every system company in the world is going to say, well, I\u2019m going to become a chip design and not at all. But it does mean that that there\u2019s a whole new wave of demand for semiconductor. And I would say, in general, electronics technology to accelerate the very algorithms that finally are starting to yield some interesting and positive results. And we\u2019ve seen this in the past.", "Once computation became interesting for a broader set of people, immediately everybody became hungry for much more and faster computation, the same is going to happen here. What is slightly different maybe then the wave of computation where computation was fairly segregated from software, meaning, the software people just were designing on a very general platform. I think this time around the platform is going to be adapted much more to the software.", "And that\u2019s why these intersections between system houses, semiconductors and ourselves are very interesting. And we purposely try to position the company at this intersection of hardware/software, because we see a big long-term opportunities there.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. So it sounds like that the way you expect the market to rollout over the next several years is a lot more, but perhaps smaller system customers that are more additive versus cannibalizing the semi guys?", "Aart de Geus", "Oh, I think there\u2019s zero cannibalization. I mean, the make up of the semiconductor industry has obviously changed substantially in the last five, six years. And you may remember the dialogues we had about maturation and a slowdown of the industry, or was it the opposite, which is the rejuvenation. And those words often go hand-in-hand and that\u2019s why change is always painful. But I think a lot of the semiconductor industry is orienting itself very much to be in sync with the emerging system companies that will take advantage first of these techniques.", "And a good example that\u2019s so visible to many is the automotive industry, where people that have nothing to do with much of the sophisticated intersection of hardware/software are now deeply involved in changing their fields by using partners to get there.", "So I\u2019m not worried that semiconductors are going to be jeopardized. Now they are ingredients, and of course, they will have to negotiate hard for pricing as they always have, because the raise is on again.", "Tom Diffely", "Okay. And when you see a higher number of smaller customers are meant in the business going forward, does that change the operating model at all as far as, especially the SG&A and R&D line?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the reason for the higher number of smaller customers comes actually from a different angle, which is, as we entered the software quality and security space, as we\u2019ve said in very broad terms fundamentally any company that significantly relies on software has challenges from a complexity and security point of view. And therefore, we\u2019ll start to look for solutions.", "Now some of those companies are not very large. And very often, the early engagements with these companies are on the basis of rather small purchase orders. And that that brings interesting challenge for Synopsys, because we have the opposite in the areas, where we have grown our business for many decades.", "And so, we are walking this balance of working with large companies and gradually increasing the purchase orders, while trying to keep the door as effectively open to anybody who wants to talk to us about these problems, because they may well turn out to be large customers in just a few years. But that brings with it a significant increase in the number of logos of companies many of which I\u2019ve never heard the name of some interesting perspective.", "Trac Pham", "Hey, Tom, this is Trac, let me just add to that. From a business model, our operating model perspective, the software integrity business definitely does open up a much broader customer set to us. And they have a different buying pattern, certainly a different scale than we\u2019re accustomed to.", "And as we think about scaling not only the software integrity business, but Synopsys to grow profitability \u2013 profitably, we\u2019re very conscious of making sure that the infrastructure that we build around that business both from a system, from a process perspective and how we deal with that is affected to scale the environment where we\u2019re dealing with many more customers at a lower price point. So we\u2019re conscious of that as we build our long-term model.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll next go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Krish Sankar", "Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. A couple of them, Aart, number one, on the IP business you said it\u2019s still pretty strong. Is there a way you can quantify either what do you think the growth rate for your IP business or for the industry is today?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we have stated for our business that it\u2019s in the low double digits, and it\u2019s doing very well in that regard. And it\u2019s also doing very well, because we see many customers that continue to commit more of their needs to us. And that bodes well, because it takes a long time to build a good trust with customers, because there\u2019s a very little tolerance for IP errors, as you would imagine.", "And so, simultaneously, the IP blocks themselves are subject to continuous evolution, not only do the standards evolve. So, yes, the version one, version two, version three of standards, these are just numbers. But number three is a lot more complex than number two, which is a lot more complex than number one. And then simultaneously, and in parallel to that, they also constantly migrate to the next silicon technology. So that\u2019s a compounding effect of complexity. And so against that backdrop, we continue to broaden our portfolio, both with the existing type tools into the next version, but also with new standards and with support of the most advanced technology nodes.", "So all of this bodes well for a continual strong business. And yes, we feel that we\u2019re actually in a very good position and we complement extremely well the leader in the industry, which would be ARM around its core offering. So we\u2019re, I think, in a very solid position.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then on the hardware side actually specifically on emulation, are you guys, I mean, familiar with the term like, are you guys competing with Cadence and Mentor on the traditional emulation? Are you really gaining more traction on the software wrapping side?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in this space, everybody is competing a little bit on everything, but it is also certainly true that we all have our respective strengths. And I think, it is a very, promising part of the industry. And as far as I can tell everybody, it\u2019s doing reasonably well.", "Having said that, there is no question that we have selected what we think is the sweet spot, which is this intersection of hardware/software. And most importantly, the ability to help software people bring up their software on the hardware that doesn\u2019t exist, so to speak, by using emulation or FPGA-based prototyping as a way to model that very hardware.", "And it is only in fairly recent years that the technology capabilities and emulation and prototyping became sufficiently fast to do that in a meaningful way. And the fact that, we can bring up, for example, a complete Android operating system on one of the most advanced apps processors on an emulator in less than half an hour, gives you a sense that, hey, if you can do that, you can run some other software too.", "And that is why, I think, that door has been opened and now people are moving towards use \u2013 using it more and more. And so from that perspective, certainly our specialty would be that and I think we\u2019re well-positioned.", "Krish Sankar", "Got it. And then I just like two final questions for Trac. One is, can you say how much is auto as a percentage of total sales for you guys?", "Trac Pham", "We haven\u2019t talked about that specifically Krish, but it\u2019s certainly increasing over time, and it\u2019s across all of our product groups.", "Aart de Geus", "Hey, if I may add something, one of the reasons we are a little cautious with those numbers is, because it\u2019s actually difficult to define. And the reason is that a number of the very big automotive-related suppliers related to our field are of course the semiconductor folks that are partially specialized. And those companies variably do many other things as well. And then it is also spread in the other parts of our business.", "So we increasingly do IP for automotive. And when I say IP for automotive, we really mean something different than the regular IP, because automotive is, at a minimum the two very challenging set of standards. One is everything that has to be certified for safety, and we really mean, the safety of the part in the context of utilization. The other thing is the automotive temperature ranges and voltage ranges can be very different.", "And so these are additional challenges and the very fact that that we manage those and that we have a rapidly growing automotive IP portfolio is a good sign, because it takes a long time to invest in those and make it work.", "Krish Sankar", "Okay. And then just a last question for Trac. Your op margin has been in the 22% to 24% range for awhile. And I understand hardware could we deal it on the gross margin level? This, if you want to look forward and where the margins could expand to, would the best opportunity come from being more efficient on the R&D side or more on the SG&A side?", "Trac Pham", "So let me step back and say that we are still committed to grow operating margins in mid-20s. When you look at our results and you peel back the results for 2017, we\u2019re actually growing margins in a very healthy way from 2016/2017 when you exclude the dilution from this Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions.", "Looking forward, as we try to determine where we can actually spend margins, I think, it\u2019s going to come across a whole variety of things at the highest level, how do we manage the business from the existing EDA IP business versus scaling up the software integrity business. And then you raise specifically from a function perspective do we see opportunities in both in R&D versus SG&A, I think, it\u2019s going to come through a combination of both of those areas.", "But I would just continue to reiterate that on the EDA side, it\u2019s a very technical, very complex space there. I think long-term, while we try to drive margins, we\u2019ll likely keep the R&D spend as a percentage of revenue in that 30% range. And if you look at the results for this year, it\u2019s close to a 30% than it\u2019s been north of that over the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next go to the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Trac, my first question for you is just in terms of how you go from about $0.56, $0.57 in EPS in October quarter to more like a $0.90 per quarter EPS trade over the next year, which is kind of the expectation the Street has for fiscal 2018. And what\u2019s causing so much variability in the hardware or the overall business now that you can go from pretty much the best quarter that you\u2019ve had to the worst quarter in terms of the earnings that you have had over the last four years?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, that\u2019s pretty a straightforward answer. It\u2019s hardware both on the emulation and HAP side. As you described, it\u2019s been a very strong hardware revenue year. Year-to-date, we had increasingly strong growth in hardware. And the profile of it is just that\u2019s the profile for Q4, it\u2019s going down quarter-to-quarter based on what the customer deliverables are.", "And I would just reiterate that typically we do manage this business on an annual basis over the long-term. And so quarter-to-quarter things would change in the past, because of IP and now increasingly as we are more successful with hardware and it becomes a bigger part of our business. You\u2019ll see more variability. We\u2019re not particularly concerned about Q4, and so, because that\u2019s a profile of the revenue that we see.", "And we feel comfortable enough with the overall business that we can, at least, guide FY 2018 to where the consensus numbers are right now. And just to remind you that as we \u2013 as you look at 2017 numbers and the guidance for 2017, we actually have taken up the revenue guidance for the full-year again.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. So just in terms of hardware, because the variable historically the market share in hardware has tended to move around quite a bit between the different suppliers. I\u2019m just trying to understand like what gives you the confidence that hardware portion comes back or remain strong in the next year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think the term has remained strong, because as Trac said, we\u2019re managing everything on the yearly basis. The fluctuations in the quarter is a phenomenon that we signaled to you, at least, four or five quarters ago, saying, hey, this is going to increase, because that\u2019s just the nature of that business.", "What we also are very clearly signaling to you is that, the problem of being able to run software before you have the chips is growing in importance, that is great news for us. We\u2019re in the right place with these technologies. And of course, we have to stay competitive and we have to continue to invest in the next generations and all of those things, but that\u2019s nothing new for Synopsys.", "So, yes, we live for 30 years of the edge of driving Moore\u2019s Law from our side. We will continue to exhibit the behaviors that hopefully accomplished that\u2019s going forward. I think the fact is that with the noisiness of the hardware on the P&L from quarter-to-quarter, the way we look at it is on a yearly basis, or a trailing 12-month type basis. And all the indicators we have right now is that, we\u2019re in a very solid position, never say that you all won\u2019t make mistakes. But right now, if anything you should take a fairly positive note away from this earnings release.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And just in terms of your headcount, it has gone up somewhat this quarter. Can you talk about some of the areas that you\u2019re investing more now?", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. And obviously, we are careful of how we invest and in this that too comes a little bit in waves as a function of how we manage the year. And typically, all of our views are careful before they invest, before they get budget for the year.", "But having said that, we continue to invest in the areas, where we see great opportunity. And we have actually, I think, a reasonably well disciplined internal process, where we watch the profitability of each of the businesses and the ones that that are much below the average of the company have a clear instructions on how to gradually move up. But we also have sometimes clear instructions to invest, because we think that there is an opportunity to grow in SIG.", "The software integrity group is definitely in that category, and that too can come in lumps by virtue of acquisitions. And so, I think, we\u2019re pretty much investing in every area of the company at this point in time. So and the software part would certainly be a prime example of that.", "Trac Pham", "Hey, Farhan, this is Trac, let me add to that kind of it. I think for a fact, we are growing and profitable across the business line. Obviously, in software integrity we\u2019re still in investment mode. But across the businesses, we are growing and have very good profitability. And so we continue to invest across the various groups.", "On the hiring you might see the pick up from Q3 to Q4, or Q2 to Q3, it\u2019s pretty much for the plan, it\u2019s not unusual. If you remember what we described in our Q1, Q2 earnings call, we were a little bit behind in hiring before we saw visibility to improvements in revenue. But the pick up in the second-half is really for the plan.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll next go to the line of Sterling Auty. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I wonder if you can give some additional color in where you saw the strength in particular in the IP business that you mentioned? And what the margin profile on that strength actually looks like?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the worst strengths almost invariably brings also a better margin profile, because when your business grows well that is, because it\u2019s partially repetitive on things that you did before, or it is in an area that are of particularly interest to customers and more advanced.", "We mentioned a little bit automotive before. I think, we\u2019re doing quite well in automotive. Across the Board, the interfaces are doing very well. The embedded vision is interesting, because this is an area that is seeing very rapid technology evolution on our part. We had an early product on the markets late last year, a number of people have done some interesting things with it and immediately came back with a slew of requests and we\u2019re fulfilling those. So these are \u2013 that\u2019s as much of fun area as it is a good area for us.", "And then lastly, we\u2019re also doing quite well in everything that touches the actual physics of semiconductors, because moving things to the advanced nodes is actually a very sophisticated set of tasks, and we are becoming better and better at that.", "Sterling Auty", "And how do you characterize the composite dynamics? So it seems like number of players you considered have been putting up good results in IP. Have you found that similar to hardware that you kind of spread out in terms of where the focus is?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we have been, I think, fairly disciplined in making sure that we invest in IP areas, where one has actually a good chance of getting a return on investment. It\u2019s very easy to jump on every piece of IP that move, so to speak, because a customer really wants it.", "But if they are the only one or if they are customers that may have grand ambitions, but in our assumption, a chance of actually not making it too significant chips. So we become more careful. And so, in general, we look to have clear proof that there\u2019s a lifecycle to the IP that we invest in.", "But we have now the benefit of many years of experience that\u2019s just said the positive word for having made mistakes and learn from them. But that learning is paying off. And as customers have seen us learn and as they have learned with us, it has built a certain degree of trust, because success is so often achieved by in the last minutes together overcoming some issues and that is only the case in IP.", "And so that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of it as an extremely solid high-quality business that\u2019s very sophisticated. But that will \u2013 have \u2013 has a very good chance of continuing to grow at a good rate.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Got it. Thank you. Good evening. Aart, let me start with you with a couple of technology questions around core EDA. So with respect to ICC in terms of its adoption, at back two years ago, Synopsys quoted you\u2019re having, I think, 33 customers at the time at back last year more than 90, and now as at back two months ago more than 150 customers. And so the question there is, do you think that the expansion of logos in terms of ICC adoption has largely ran its course, since now you become relatively more dependent on expansion for logo, or do you think there\u2019s still a good logo expansion opportunity?", "And then second, core EDA question, thinking back also to back two months ago in your joint presentation with TSMC an ARM, there was a lot of discussion, of course, around 7-nanometer and some of the implications for core EDA tools. In that respect, how do you think 7-nanometer or anything under 10 might impact synthesis specifically, imagine that\u2019s still more than $200 million business for you, probably generating some good margin and cash flow. And is there some upside opportunity owing to the technical requirements of advanced submicron for that product line?", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, let\u2019s start with the ICC logo expansion. The expansion will continue, but the reality in our field is by the time you\u2019re at a logo number 150, those are typically dramatically smaller in their expenditures than it\u2019s only the top 5, or 10, or 20, or 50. And so the expansion then typically tends to continue more in breadth with the existing companies. And of course, they gradually move over from the previous version ICC-1 to ICC-2.", "Regarding the intersection of our tools with TSMC and ARM, as one of the key cores that is so relevant to many of our joint customers. And that intersection with us all on the theme of 7-nanometer, I think, there\u2019s no question that 7-nanometer and for similar technologies from other vendors they have a different number for it. But think of it as the most advanced production manufacturing technology, it is growing rapidly.", "And if we look at the curves of FinFET, in general, while there was probably a discontinuity between playing our technology, which is 28-nanometer and everything underneath that, which became FinFET. At this point in time, we sort of see the same curves of adoption and growth except, of course, that the chips are again dramatically more complex. And the complexity is both in terms of the gate counts, but also in the literal, physical or interconnect demand for the synthesis place and route, verification and timing tools and so on.", "And so I hesitate to say it like that with each sort of technology business as usual for you stay on the exponential, keep driving it like crazy, and the chips will continue to come out successfully. And so a lot of work has gone into that. And of course, for TSMC 7-nanometer is sort of their flagship. They are \u2013 they have pushed very hard. They have multiple versions of 7-nanometer, and all of this is continually aligned with them on a technology basis and continually exercised with ARM on their lock.", "And so our joint job is to deliver best possible chips, while reducing the risks and then the work that it takes. But I would say, so far, so good, actually. I think, it\u2019s doing quite well.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Right. I appreciate that. Actually I was asking for a specific comment on gradually for synthesis. But let me move on to my next question having to do with hardware. So inferring from your results and your comments, it would seem that Synopsys will have been the largest by revenue and emulation for the quarter and for the trailing 12 months, which you\u2019ve not been before, but that\u2019s what the data now suggest. My question is, since this ramp-up in emulation began about two years ago for you now to this new much higher level, has either been consistently larger, either on a quarterly or trailing 12-month basis than perhaps, or have been in periods, where prototyping was, in fact, larger than emulation?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, as you all know, we never disclose the very specifics of individual products. But maybe answering at the start of your question, there is no question that the hardware solution and we really think of it as a combination of ZeBu and tabs has done extremely well for Synopsys. And by the way, I think that\u2019s the overall industry has done well.", "So this is not a negative on our competitors. But for Synopsys, we came from a few years of having zero position there into a very, very strong position. And I think, it is very much on the strength of the technology, but also on the focus of the right place with the customers. And I do expect this area to continue to be strong. And you\u2019ve heard the caveats before of lumpiness and all that. But fundamentally, the theory of understanding design and the importance of software, which I will say, this area will continue to be very important for people getting system products to the market.", "And so, yes, we\u2019re gratified that the team has executed very well. And that we have a number of very advanced customers that are really seeing the benefit of shortening the time to market of the combination of hardware and software. And therefore, we expect them to continue to want to accelerate the benefit.", "Operator", "Still we have four minutes to the top of the hour. We will go to Monika Garg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, if I look at upfront revenue year-to-date, it\u2019s almost growing more than 50% year-to-date. Is it most of it coming from emulation, or something else adding to that too?", "Aart de Geus", "Monika, it\u2019s a combination of hardware, which is \u2013 it\u2019s hardware, which is a combination of emulation and HAPS.", "Monika Garg", "Got it. Then, Aart, a lot of companies used to do EDA development in-house, given the increasing complexity of EDA tools and design complexity. Do you see more EDA development moving to EDA companies? Also, how do you think the increasing silicon content in autos, artificial intelligence, machine learning, [sell timing costs] [ph] everything, how does that change the TAM for EDA tools?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, the move of internal EDA to commercial EDA, i.e., to the EDA companies started to accelerate massively in the 1980s. And I would say that by the 2000s, it was a rare occurrence that people would develop their own EDA tools. There are a few companies that still rely somewhat on their internals, because the internal EDA is specialized for the type of machines they built. And the well-known example that stands out is, IBM for their super big machines.", "But aside of that, I\u2019d be really hard pressed to point at anybody. Now the exception to that may be that in some areas, people may develop some specialized tools that actually add something to what ours tools are doing. So they may have a special analysis that they put in our time or in our place and route system or so in order to get better results for something that they want to be quiet about and are doing.", "Your question on the machine learning is very pertinence, because just like we are preaching that the impact of digital intelligence will have importance everywhere, while we are part of everywhere. And so we have quite a number of projects ourselves in that area. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity to rethink about problems. But I also want to caution that, when you have big excitement waves, there can be a little bit of a bubble phenomenon where suddenly everybody thinks that they know what to do and one can easily over invest in that as well.", "And so we have been fortunate to be quite engaged in this field with both the number of customers and internally. So I think, we have a good balance in it, but it will have an impact on EDA tools. And we certainly are in the camp of having an enormous amount of data and we will try to use that wisely.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the final question will come from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Mitch Steves", "Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just have one for Aart and one for Trac. So just from a high-level perspective when I think about people using more tools to kind of design chips, are you seeing more the demand, because people are creating new chips, or because people are trying to fit more transistors onto the chips themselves?", "Aart de Geus", "For \u2013 I was going to say years, but I really meant to say decades. It\u2019s been the latter, which is it\u2019s the complexity of the chips, not the number of chips that has driven our business. And up until 2000s or so, the number of chips was growing, and after that, it actually came down to about half and has been \u2013 as far as I can tell somewhat stable since then, and so it\u2019s complexity that\u2019s driving.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. And then second one for Trac just really quick. I know you\u2019ve just talked how FY 2018 seems like you guys can do that basic consensus numbers. But given the fact that hardware is becoming a larger percent of the business. Do we \u2013 should we anticipate hearing kind of a long-term growth rate for that business, given that you\u2019ve given it to us for kind of the software piece, the EDA, the mid-singles, et cetera?", "Trac Pham", "No, we typically don\u2019t break-out product categories. I think to remind you the emulation business hardware rolls up into core EDA. And that\u2019s part of our guidance in terms of the growth rate for the areas in the low to mid single digits.", "Mitch Steves", "Right. So despite the hardware increase, you still think you can hit that \u2013 the target?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, long-term, yes.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think we have arrived at the end of our allocated hour. Thank you for your interest and excellent questions. Hopefully, you took away from the earnings release that we delivered good results and feel very solid about the year. We were cautious to not give yet guidance for 2018, we\u2019re not ready for that, but you did get a sense that we support the consensus as it stands. We will be available after the earnings call and thank you, again, for your interest.", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Reba. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. The company will also refer to the planned acquisition of Black Duck Software. Please note that the acquisition is not yet closed and is subject to closing conditions and regulatory review.", "Finally, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon. I am happy to report another excellent quarter and with it another outstanding year for Synopsys. In fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.725 billion, an increase of 12.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42, 13% growth, we generated $635 million in operating cash flow, our three-year backlog grew by approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion and we bought back $400 million of our stock.", "These results extended our multi-year track record of strong growth with three-year CAGRs of 10% for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, accentuated by upside from hardware and IP, our business became stronger and stronger as we moved through the year, resulting in good revenue growth across all product groups and all geographies.", "The fiscal \u201817 double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth was achieved through both revenue growth and increasing operating margin, even with acquisition-related dilution. Simultaneously, we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions with good organic growth, the Cigital acquisition in Q1 and the planned Black Duck transaction announced earlier this month. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "As we assess the business we\u2019ve built over the past 30 plus years and look forward to the next five years to 10 years, we\u2019re enthusiastic about our prospects. The market opportunity is vast and increasing as we enter the age of Smart Everything. Synopsys is well-aligned to benefit from the emerging market dynamics. And lastly, our financial position and priorities amply support our aspirations.", "Let me expand on these three elements of our value proposition. First, the age of Smart Everything or Digital Intelligence is here. Following the decades driven by Computation and then Mobility, Digital Intelligence is the third major wave of electronics impact.", "Week by week we can see its reach growing, be it through the Internet of Things, automotive, virtual reality, medical devices or industrial. The need to manipulate massive amounts of data, apply AI through machine learning, while guaranteeing security is unstoppable. All of this is made possible with an insatiable hunger for next-generation advanced chips and complex software developed by our customers.", "Second, Synopsys is uniquely positioned at the very intersection of silicon hardware and software. Our design and verification tools are essential for the next-generation of advanced chips and systems. Our growing silicon-proven IP offering reduces risk and speeds time-to-market. In addition, our Software Integrity portfolio prevents code flaws from becoming security disasters.", "And third, we have maintained strong financial solidity while broadening our company TAM precisely for the opportunity at hand. Our recurring revenue model lets us consistently invest in advanced product development and support. We\u2019ve managed our strong balance sheet and cash flow to enable both consistent stock buybacks and TAM-broadening acquisitions. And we\u2019re driving shareholder value through long-term, high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings growth.", "Elaborating on our market and technical position, let me provide some highlights, beginning with EDA. With continued silicon and architectural sophistication, the success of next-generation chips is paramount in bringing about big data and machine learning opportunities.", "Synopsys EDA continues to enable astounding levels of complexity, resulting in strong demand for state-of-the-art solutions across our product lines. Even with strong competition and continued customer consolidation, we\u2019ve fared well with growth outpacing the others over the past several years.", "We continue to strongly invest in our market leading digital design platform. Our solution has been instrumental in enabling many firsts, the first ever 10 nanometer production design, the first 7 nanometer tapeout, and now significant activity on early 5 nanometer designs. The largest ever FinFET design was implemented with the Synopsys platform, as was the largest networking processor in the world.", "Our digital platform is consistently trusted on the most advanced projects and is relied on for more than 95% of all FinFET designs. Our success is particularly evident in applications such as mobile, automotive, CPUs, graphics and AI-specific processors. And while we\u2019re seeing share gains with customers across industries ranging from networking to storage to sensors, automotive has been particularly strong with nine of the top 10 automotive IC suppliers enabled through the Synopsys platform. Notably, at a leading automotive IC supplier, we\u2019re growing and displacing the competition.", "Meanwhile, the move to smaller geometries continues. New manufacturing approaches, new materials, and new innovative transistor structures require our 3D TCAD expertise to develop them.", "In Q4, we announced the acquisition of QuantumWise, whose amazing atomic-level simulation tools enhance our ability to model the most advanced next-generation devices. In custom and analog mixed-signal design, our Custom Compiler and Circuit Simulation not only demonstrated excellent technical results but saw good revenue growth during the year.", "Customers such as MediaTek, Renesas, Panasonic, ST and TDK/Micronas have reported very successful deployments and tapeouts using our Custom Compiler solution, which is targeted specifically at FinFET designs.", "Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys. We realized a number of years ago that as chips and systems became more and more complex, verification would increasingly be required at the intersection of hardware and software. Over the last years, while collaborating with market leading customers, we developed a comprehensive verification platform that excels at exactly that.", "In fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains. One example is Samsung SARC, which chose our Verification Continuum, including simulation, formal, emulation, debug and verification IP as the primary solution for their advanced mobile processor designs.", "Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well. Among high profile customers presenting at the Design Automation Conference in June, AMD highlighted its use of our ZeBu emulation for early software development and bring-up. For software, emulation speed is critical and ZeBu is the fastest solution in the market.", "In Q4, we saw another example of the huge potential for our emulation. A mobile giant, faced with verification challenges inherent in software-rich mobile platforms adopted ZeBu citing its performance superiority.", "Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth. Over the past 15 plus years, we\u2019ve built the broadest portfolio of IP titles and subsystems and have become a trusted partner and market leader. Our foundry relationships and active drive in standards groups ensure that customers can buy leading-edge products in key technology processes at the earliest stages.", "During 2017, we further expanded our portfolio, with continued focus on automotive, IoT and security. We expanded our IoT offering with our new ARC Secure IP subsystem for endpoint security and our IoT Development Kit to accelerate software development for sensor fusion, voice recognition and face detection designs.", "We announced the collaboration with Morpho, a leader in digital security and identity solutions to accelerate deep learning processing for embedded vision applications. In Q4, we acquired Sidense, adding One-Time Programmable Non-Volatile Memory IP, which is used in automotive and IoT among other markets.", "Our IP group has been a beneficiary of customer consolidation, providing outsourcing options to companies who want to target their limited engineering resources more towards differentiating their projects.", "Let me next move to our Software Integrity Group, which provides products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.", "Customers for these solutions span semiconductor and systems companies, who are embedding considerable software content into their chips and devices, all the way to developers of software in industries such as financial services, medical, automotive and high-impact industrial.", "Over the past three-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve become a clear leader in this emerging high-growth industry. Since our initial entry with the acquisition of Coverity, we\u2019ve invested both organically and through key acquisitions to develop a product platform and services to better serve companies deal with daunting software security problems. As we gain scale and credibility, our brand recognition continues to strengthen. Gartner ranks Synopsys now as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing.", "During the year, we made good progress integrating the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, and are now seeing a positive impact on demand. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, the leader in testing Open Source software for known security vulnerabilities and license compliance. With Open Source making up 60% or more of all applications, this capability is critical to deliver a robust platform.", "Initial customer reaction has been great, as they recognize the benefits of combining Black Duck\u2019s highly respected capabilities with the broader Synopsys offering. The acquisition is scheduled to close shortly, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions. Our vision and investments are resonating well with customers and we\u2019re excited about the long-term potential of this product group.", "Lastly, I\u2019ve mentioned a number of vertical markets this afternoon. One key vertical that is going through momentous change and is directly impacted by our end-to-end solutions is automotive. Let me provide some highlights resulting from our multiyear automotive strategy.", "Because safety is so critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4.", "During this year, we\u2019ve massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process.", "In Q4, we extended a multiyear Automotive Center of Excellence collaboration with NXP, enabling early software development for next-generation electronic systems. We\u2019re also well-recognized in the industry, serving as a leader on the Society of Automotive Engineers\u2019 Cyber Security Task Force focused on driving new standards for software security.", "In summary, for Synopsys, fiscal 2017 was an excellent year, positioning us well going forward. We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board. Our EDA and IP products are delivering top-notch results for customers building chips to bring about the Digital Intelligence, Smart Everything age. And we\u2019re making significant progress in scaling our software security platform and market leadership position.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. To echo what Aart said, our strong finish in Q4 capped an outstanding 2017. This year\u2019s success reflects our commitment to deliver solid financial results in the near-term, while simultaneously creating sustainable growth and profitability over the long-term.", "Over the last three years, we have continued to expand our leadership in EDA and IP, while also broadening our portfolio with our Software Integrity solutions. We are executing very well on our strategy, which is reflected not only in the broad-based strength of our financial results, but also in the expansion of our Software Integrity business group with the announced planned acquisition of Black Duck.", "Based on our recent performance, the strength of our portfolio and the backlog coverage heading into fiscal \u201818, we are optimistic about our ability to drive sustainable success in the coming years. As I discuss the financial highlights, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.", "We delivered total revenue of $697 million in Q4 and $2.725 billion for the year, an annual growth rate of 12.5%. Business was strong across all product groups, particularly hardware and IP. In addition to another record year for hardware, our Q4 results included approximately $30 million in revenue from a large hardware shipment that was planned for 2018 but shifted into Q4.", "Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals. We again have a large proportion of 2018 revenue, approximately 75% already in hand, providing stability and predictability not often seen in enterprise software companies.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $605 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $566 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year. 2017 expenses increased due primarily to higher costs associated with acquisitions, employee compensation and cost of goods sold for hardware sales. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.8% for the year, even with the modest dilution from our Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions.", "We posted GAAP earnings for the year of $0.88 per share, including a loss of $0.80 in the quarter, reflecting the one-time impact of our repatriation of offshore cash, which I\u2019ll talk more about in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter and $3.42 for the year, an annual growth rate of 13%.", "As I mentioned earlier, Q4 had the benefit of a hardware-related shift, which was the primary driver of $0.11 overachievement versus expectations. Even excluding this upside, we delivered annual EPS growth of 10%, exceeding our original target.", "We generated $185 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and $635 million for the year. We significantly exceeded our original 2017 target due to strong collections and business levels throughout the year, as well as $30 million received from ATopTech for litigation damages.", "During the quarter, we initiated the repatriation of $825 million of offshore cash, taking advantage of our R&D tax credits and resulting in a cash tax rate of approximately 6%. This resulted in a GAAP-only tax expense of $166 million in Q4 and will drive a one-time cash tax payment of approximately $40 million in early 2018.", "Also affecting 2018 operating cash flow is a $65 million one-time payment to the Hungarian tax authority, in connection with an ongoing tax dispute. While we expect to prevail, we are required to make this payment as a condition for continuing our appeal. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 53% onshore and total debt of $144 million.", "In 2017, we used about 70% of our free cash flow for stock buybacks. We repurchased $400 million this year and over the past three years have repurchased close to $1.1 billion of our stock. We have $400 million remaining on our current authorization. Our current plan for 2018 is to use buybacks to keep share count roughly flat.", "Before providing 2018 guidance, let me briefly comment on the Black Duck acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and closing conditions, but we expect will close in December. When closed, we will pay approximately $548 million net of cash.", "Due to a purchase-accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $25 million to $30 million, Black Duck is expected to contribute roughly $55 million to $60 million revenue in 2018. We expect it to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2019 and be accretive thereafter.", "Now to guidance, due primarily to an extra week in fiscal Q1 and the profile of expenses, we expect first half revenue and earnings to be greater than the second half. Q1 targets are, revenue between $740 million and $765 million, which includes approximately $40 million from the extra week, total GAAP costs and expenses between $625 million and $641 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $560 million and $570 million, other income and expense between minus $1 million and $1 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share to $0.70 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share to $1.02 per share, including approximately $0.05 from the extra week.", "For 2018, total revenue of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, a growth rate of 6% to 7%. Excluding Black Duck, the total revenue target range is $2.82 billion to $2.855 billion. Other income and expense between minus $6 million and minus $2 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $2.24 per share to $2.38 per share or $2.68 per share to $2.80 per share excluding Black Duck, non-GAAP earnings of $3.46 per share to $3.53 per share or $3.58 per share to $3.65 per share excluding Black Duck, capital expenditures of approximately $110 million and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects one-time cash payments totaling approximately $105 million.", "In summary, we are executing very well on our goal to drive long-term shareholder value. We reported outstanding results across the Board in 2017, while delivering a high level of predictability with $3.7 billion of backlog and scaling our Software Integrity products with the acquisition of Black Duck.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Lisa Ewbank", "Reba, are you there?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, ma\u2019am, I am.", "Lisa Ewbank", "We are ready for Q&A.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] I do have on site Mr. Gary Mobley, your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi. Can you hear me okay.", "Aart de Geus", "Yes. Thank you.", "Gary Mobley", "Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong finish to the year.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Gary Mobley", "Trac, can you confirm whether or not the Software Integrity Group finished fiscal year \u201817 with about $170 million? And with the contribution from Black Duck as you outlined in your guidance, can you give us a sense of where Software Integrity will be for fiscal year \u201818? And is there any quantifiable impact to ASC 606 implying your Q1 and fiscal year \u201818 guide?", "Trac Pham", "So let me start with your first question on SIG. The numbers you described for SIG is pretty consistent with what we had guided at the beginning of year, and yes, we did achieve the goals that we\u2019d outlined at the start of the year.", "Second part is, we are not calling out the numbers for Software Integrity specifically for next year, but it is consistent with about 20% growth on an ongoing basis. And Black Duck separately from that as we mentioned is in the range of $55 million to $60 million of revenues for 2018. With regards to 606, we will be implementing 606 starting in fiscal \u201819, so there is no -- that is not factored into the \u201818 guidance.", "Gary Mobley", "Got you. Okay. And Aart, this is somewhat topical just given that we\u2019ve seen or we had the RISC-V gathering \u2013 semiannual gathering this past week and so, curious to get your perspective on the impact of this open RISC-V processor IP as it relates to your ARC business and then as well does it drive a wave of, say for example, compiler EDA sales for you looking forward and is it a significant impact on that front as well?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, RISC-V is sort of in its beginnings, but it is also one processor among many being built right now. This is aimed, I think, at being more a general purpose processor and maybe of high interest to some parties. But many people are focusing right now on the development of AI-specific processors, and so from our perspective as EDA and IP provider, it\u2019s a little bit like the more the merrier, because we can support many people doing designs, and we expect many processes to be optimized specifically for the applications, because the hunger for more speed will be so high that just going to smaller geometries will not be sufficient, and therefore, people will say, \u201cHey, if I can build processors that are narrower and just aimed at some application and can make them faster,\u201d and we\u2019re seeing really a plethora of companies investing in them.", "Gary Mobley", "Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Next on the line we have Rich Valera, Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. Aart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the business got stronger as the year went on, sounds like kind of maybe each quarter got stronger. I am wondering how much of that you would attribute to just general macro strength, just kind of global economy improving versus some underlying kind of secular trends going on in the -- that are affecting the EDA industry whether it\u2019s new areas as you mentioned all of the sort of smart areas, but do you think there are some things going on that are actually expanding the TAM of the traditional EDA market that are helping the business grow or do you mainly attribute it to just better macro?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think, the answer is yes, yes, yes, because there is no question that the overall global economy has done well, mostly because all regions are reasonably solid and so having those in unison tends to help things.", "Secondly, there is no question that semiconductor has had a very, very strong year. And in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particularly strong and so these things tend to go up and down but up feels better than down, no question about that.", "And then, lastly, and I think that that is actually the factor that will matter most in the long-term is that, this move into this next wave of electronics enabling a very notion that was [indiscernible] in the \u201890s of artificial intelligence and outcomes under a set of other names, big data, machine learning, digital intelligence, I\u2019d like to call it Smart Everything, that will drive a very broad consumption of semiconductors, because the amounts of data generated by IoTs and various forms of sensors are growing by leaps and bounds, and just think of any camera as being really billions of pixels being generated.", "Secondly, this data needs to be manipulated through machine learning, which is extremely compute in terms, and then the machine learning it in terms gets interpreted in the utilization, let\u2019s say inside of a car for example.", "And then on top of that, you need to add one more aspect, which is security. And security, there is a very, very big component to that in the software part of our business, but it also will impact hardware as a variety of security modules will get added. So, I think, that semiconductor is at -- really at the heart of enabling a whole new wave of impact and therefore would stay reasonably healthy just on that basis only.", "Rich Valera", "Great. Thank you for that. And I have a couple of questions on Black Duck, can you say roughly what that was growing and if you think you can perhaps accelerate that growth rate, and also, Trac, I am not sure, if you\u2019re willing to share, how much revenue you expect to lose from the deferred revenue purchase accounting? Thanks.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we don\u2019t give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions. And frankly, our first job is to always make sure that the company really lands well and that we can quickly look at what are the upsides for them with Synopsys or for Synopsys with them, that goes in both directions.", "Having said that though, I think, what is exciting about Black Duck is that, they are really have grown up and have impact to the whole aspect of software refer to as Open Source. And one of the biggest productivity increases and this is true on chips with IP, I think, it is true on software by virtue of our use of software and Open Source software is, of course, the fact that you can use software for many sources and assemble it quickly.", "There are quite a number of lurking dangers in that and there is a large catalogue of known vulnerabilities, and when people integrate this Open Source code material and they don\u2019t pay attention to at least the vulnerabilities that already known, I think that\u2019s closely delinquent when thinking about building secured software. And so it\u2019s just a natural for us as an extension of our focus on quality and security of software.", "Trac Pham", "Rich, the guidance for our revenue for Black Duck is about $55 million to $60 million for 2018 and then deferred haircut is about $25 million to $30 million. As for Aart described the market SIG, we\u2019re expecting -- Software Integrity we\u2019re expecting to grow in the 20% range and Black Duck is being doing very well -- as very well and then there -- the market demand and the secular trends in that space would drive growth similarly in that range.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Next on the line we have Farhan Ahmad, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on autos, you talked about the growing opportunity in autos, in particularly as it relates to ISO 26262 and your role in the IP there. So could you just talk about how much is the exposure that you have to the auto market and what is your opportunity in both EDA and IP?", "Aart de Geus", "It\u2019s actually a quite difficult question, because we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we ourselves find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regularly semiconductor deliveries.", "Having said that though, the reason I like to highlight automotive is because it is such a poster child for what big changes are happening in an industry that traditionally was very slow in the adoption of any super advanced technology and so many semiconductor technology.", "I highlighted specifically the fact that we had invested substantially in automotive certified IP in FinFET 16, because three years ago nobody in their right mind would have ever associated the word FinFET in automotive and today all of the big providers in that value chain are focusing on that, because they need more computation inside of the car.", "And so the investments that we\u2019ve made are not only to provide the tools that are suited for designing and modeling what goes into a car, but as you mentioned that also fulfill the existing standards that initially were all built up really for safety and only now are gradually being evolved towards security and those are words that we can certainly deal with very well. So I think we\u2019re well-equipped to be a good provider in that value chain.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And then the second question is on the Software Integrity side. I mean, once you integrate Black Duck, the total Software Integrity portion of the business will be larger than 10%. Do you think at some point you will start giving us disclosures separately for the Software Integrity business?", "Trac Pham", "Well, that\u2019s a very good question. That\u2019s something we will actively consider as we progress throughout the year. Our focus in the near-term clearly is to increase that business and make sure that we can drive the growth that we\u2019ve got planned for the year. But as we progress, we will look very closely at that amount of disclosure we want to provide balancing between keeping the information, avoiding competitive issues, as well as on the flipside making sure that investors get enough insights on the business to evaluate the opportunity.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And just one last question on the market share, you are growing significantly higher than some of your industry peers this year. Some of the strength obviously throughout the year, you\u2019ve talked about hardware has been a big portion of the growth, but when you look at your throughout the product portfolio on the core EDA and manufacturing, what are some of the areas that you\u2019re gaining market share in this year?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I am always careful answering questions like that, because often the claims get out of hand quickly. We have extremely competent competitors like Cadence and Mentor, of course, are the largest ones. In some areas, Cadence has been growing a bit faster in digital design. We have been growing faster in verification. Things ebb and flow and go back and forth.", "But in aggregate as an industry, we\u2019re quite competitive, because we have to constantly develop technology that\u2019s at the leading edge. And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so we\u2019ve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And next on the line we have Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir.", "Jackson Ader", "Great. Thank you. Hey, guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. One question from our side, it looks like the time-based licenses had a pretty significant spike up and you mentioned the -- Trac, the $30 million in revenue from a hardware shipment that was pulled forward into the quarter. Does that explain -- I don\u2019t think that that would necessarily explain all the shifts in time-based licenses, so we\u2019re just trying to triangulate the two?", "Trac Pham", "Jackson, actually, it doesn\u2019t drive -- the hardware would not drive the time-based products. And keep in mind that we do look at that over time and it could vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the nature of the contracts. Royalties can also fall into that that as well. So, there is really no issues within the core and that\u2019s not related to hardware at all.", "Jackson Ader", "Okay. So what was it then that drove the sequential increase?", "Trac Pham", "Overall, the business was very strong. I mean you look at the growth across the geographies, the crisscross different products, even to the cost the number of top customers we had very solid growth, so there\u2019s any number of things that can drive it. We did end the year on a very strong -- with very strong run rate growth so the business is very healthy.", "Jackson Ader", "Okay. And then one quick follow-up, the expected 2018 revenue that is expected to come from the backlog dipped down to 75%. Is that mostly because of Black Duck or is there something else we should be reading into?", "Trac Pham", "No. It\u2019s really a function of hardware, as hardware gets to be a larger part of our business, it changes that mix a little bit. Excluding hardware, we\u2019re running generally in the same percentage as we have historically. So there\u2019s no -- there\u2019s been no change to the business model with that regard.", "Jackson Ader", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And next on the line we have Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities. Your line is open.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thank you. Good evening. Aart, with respect to the strengthening of the business over the course of the year, would you say that that was correlated more or less in real time to the positive inflection that we\u2019ve been seeing for the last three quarters or four quarters in semiconductor R&D spending, that\u2019s your principal source of revenue and it\u2019s clearly been trending higher for the industry over the last number of quarters and perhaps that\u2019s what you saw over the course of the year in real-time in terms of unscheduled business for software or IP as you -- or as you pointed out accelerated hardware or might there still be a lagging effect from semi-R&D that we have begin to see now more in 2018?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, a little bit everything you said is true, meaning that, there\u2019s no question that when your customers do really well, they are a little less hesitant in spending money and semiconductors have been doing extremely well and I expected right now to continue for a bit.", "At the same time, the -- our solution in the verification space, the overall verification platform, which includes the emulation and the FPGA prototyping boards has done very, very well. And this is not completely a surprise, but somewhat difficult to predict in timing, because it follows what we have said, which is the center of gravity between hardware and software is going to increase in importance. With more complex software, people want to run the software before they have the hardware and therefore they model the hardware and that\u2019s the basis that we\u2019re in.", "The third aspect I would mention is that, our IP business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continued investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do. And as you probably know the advanced nodes keep rolling out at a rapid pace, because the providers are very competitive with each other.", "And last but not least, the Software Integrity platform, so far I think is living up to our open expectations to be good pillar for the company that is on one hand completely adjacent to what we already do both in terms of technology and complexity and in many cases in embedded situations.", "On the other hand, it\u2019s clearly a fresh TAM for us as we were talking to customers that in the past we would never have dreamed of interacting with. Jokingly, I sometimes say, we now have customers from Samsung to Starbucks, in fact is it\u2019s actually true and so that is a very big opportunity space.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "When you think about the Black Duck acquisition, can you talk about how you are thinking about integrating it in terms of technology with the other parts of the SIG portfolio and/or perhaps your thoughts on integrating the software integrity portfolio in any case with let\u2019s say your hardware-based prototyping to expand your overall concept of verification, system verification and so forth?", "Aart de Geus", "This makes for a very long discussion, because we have -- we are now very, very rich in technologies in this domain. And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past, and we\u2019re already starting to get I would say very strong positive feedback from the number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has longevity and some mass, gives them a better feeling of security that we\u2019re going to be around.", "That\u2019s just another way of saying, there is a lot of work ahead and we are continually integrating capabilities. But it is after we really understand them well and so an integration is really a two-year to three-year process at many different levels.", "Having said that, Black Duck resonates very well with many of our customers and they understand immediately that doing some automatic checks on software that comes in from variety of not always understood sources is a good defense mechanism that they need and so, I think, that we will be well-equipped together with them to drive this area forward.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "All right. Lastly, for Trac, with respect to the $30 million of accelerated hardware revenue into Q4, could you comment on the relative contribution from either ZeBu or HAPS in there, I mean, was it more one than the other. And then, similarly, it looks like you also had some quite good upside in the IP business, was that more from services than IP product?", "Trac Pham", "Okay. So let\u2019s start with the first one which is easy. We won\u2019t give more detail on the hardware. We\u2019ll leave it at hardware for now. But we continue -- for the year we actually did very well on both HAPS and emulation. So, as I said, it was very broadly -- the business was broadly strong. As far IP, it was with a combination of services and products.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Right. Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Next on the line we have Monika Garg with KeyBanc Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.", "Monika Garg", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question is, if I take out the $40 million revenue of extra week and $55 million from Black Duck, it seems you are guiding to organic growth without those two components to about like 3% to 4%, in spite of the fact that you just talked 20% growth at your software security business. So, why such a low growth if I take out these extra two stuff in -- from 2018 guidance?", "Trac Pham", "Well, actually -- we actually did the full normalization taking into account the fact that we had $30 million that was planned for \u201818, that shifted to Q4. We do the math that you just did on Black Duck -- and Black Duck. We\u2019ve got mid single-digit growth on revenues and we are actually growing earnings per share on a high single-digit basis.", "So I think as we continue to describe we\u2019re really running this business over a multiyear period. And in this particular quarter, you\u2019re getting a very high sense of that, because in one month you\u2019re seeing a very significant shift in revenues. And so, it\u2019s best to look at our business on a multiyear basis and if you go back and look at the charts for revenue growth and earnings growth, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job executing against that.", "Monika Garg", "All right. So if I look at the M&A on the software security side last three years, four years you have done, you\u2019ve spent almost $1.2 billion. Could you walk through how you look at the ROI from these investments, what are the free cash flow metrics you\u2019re looking to generate over the next three years, four years? Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, for starters, we always start to look at this via a multiyear perspective, because acquisitions like that, they take some time to integrate, they have haircuts, they have a number of complexities on the financial side that that need to be understood on a longer term perspective.", "We have actually a fairly well-honed process of trying to understand the value of the acquisition based on the cash flow that comes out of it over many years. We don\u2019t disclose the exact metrics, but we have a fairly good discipline for that.", "We review this for many years after the acquisition with our Board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another word of saying, it\u2019s always difficult to exactly predict. But in aggregate, it has been part of how we continue to create value for the company and in that context Black Duck is not an exception.", "Our own sense is that this is a particularly valuable acquisition, because of the strategic position it fills technically in the portfolio, but also because of the very acute value it can create by reducing the risk profile for customers. So, that is the process that we follow. Nothing is perfect and I am sure we can always do better, but we do have a long-term experience that has worked out pretty well for us.", "Monika Garg", "All right. Just last one on the software security side again, most of the customers are software security are still in financials industry software, so maybe talk more about your sales strategy especially given the Black Duck acquisitions. Would you need to ramp sales and marketing more or would you look to develop channel for this segment?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, this is an excellent question, because there are so many opportunities and your commentary is partially correct in that when we did the Cigital acquisition. Cigital was particularly focused on the financial sector. At the same time, my mentioning earlier of the automotive sector was interesting, because those people are just as interested in the issues of security and software as anything else.", "The other areas that are also highly paranoid about what can happen medical is a good example and you\u2019ve seen some really horrific acts happening there. And so, I think, over time, no area, no verdict vertical is immune to the damages that can be done by essentially leaving the software doors wide open for hackers. And so this is going to become more and more a must do everywhere.", "But clearly, the sectors that are most sensitive also the ones that have been most attacked. And the financial sector, it quickly goes to the bottomline, because the attack means trying to steal money and that brings a very rapid reaction.", "So we are prudent in investing in verticals, because each vertical requires skills, it requires understanding the vocabularies and it requires understanding who to interact with. But I think our opportunity space will continue to grow and with is this part of our company broadening, we will put some more effort in understanding what are the best channels to do that, but so far I think we\u2019ve been executing reasonably well.", "Monika Garg", "Thank you so much.", "Aart de Geus", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And here comes our next question from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.", "Mitch Steves", "I just had two, one for Aart and one for Trac. So, sorry, I will start with Aart, from a high level perspective, I believe the Black Duck have talked publicly about kind of $5.6 billion TAM and you guys have talked about a $2.4 or so billion TAM in the original acquisition. So can you give us a broad update on that? And then, secondly, is this kind of the last transaction you need to get all the four capabilities in the top side of the business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, let me go backwards. We continue, of course, to always look at opportunities, at the same time, it\u2019s also important to make sure that we executed well on the integration of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done so far. And while we have a number of teams that are extremely skilled at this, every case is different and so they take some time. And what is also interesting is that as we bring new members to our team, they bring fresh perspective, I like to call it fresh DNA that allows us to shop and how we think about the field.", "To be honest on your TAM question, I sort of read the same reports that most people do and I am equally skeptical if the number reflects any reality, because when you have a very rapidly developing market where there are many, many different, very fractured companies, that typically indicates that there\u2019s a high need and that the need is still not satisfied or still in development and those are actually all positive words, because that\u2019s just coming opportunity, but it also says that adding up whatever these companies have been able to do and then extrapolating this mostly spreadsheet effort.", "And I don\u2019t want to be negative when people are trying to forecast it, because it is important, of course, but from our perspective, right now, the size of the TAM is the least of our issues. I think we have open space to run with and our challenge is how quickly can we execute on this, not are there more customers to call on, there are many more.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. And it\u2019s actually for, Trac, the financial question so, a small one is the Coverity and Cigital piece combined still tracking to kind of that combined business excluding Black Duck being profit on the back half? And then, secondly, is there any sort of way to track the health of the business besides kind of the quarterly update calls we get from you guys?", "Trac Pham", "Yes. The numbers for that we had discussed for the Software Integrity business was tracking to both revenue and profitability for this year. And then as far as the getting more update on the Software Integrity business and progress there, I think, we\u2019ll start with the quarterly calls, that\u2019s a good start and then throughout this year, as I said earlier, we\u2019ll evaluate how best to provide more insights to the analysts, as well as our investors on that business.", "Mitch Steves", "Got it. Thank you. Great quarter.", "Trac Pham", "Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no additional questions in queue. Please go ahead.", "Aart de Geus", "So at this point in time, first a big thank you for having reported on us and supporting us during the year. Fiscal \u201817 turned out to be a very good year, not only from results point of view, but to most importantly from the perspective of preparing us for the next few years. And by now it already feels a little old and so we are fully proceeding on like on 2018 and hope to talk to you soon. As usual, we\u2019ll be available for individual calls in a few minutes. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T.

And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter Fiscal Year of 2018. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last for one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference [Technical Difficulty].", "Lisa Ewbank", "Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.", "While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.", "In addition to any risks that we highlight, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.", "All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.", "Aart de Geus", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year as we delivered double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenue was $769 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.10 both above our target ranges. We continue to return capital to shareholders initiating a $200 million share repurchase and we closed the important acquisition of Black Duck Software. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.", "The market we serve through our three customer groups; semiconductors, systems companies, and software developers had a very strong 2017. The semi industry grew 19% and I'm always forecast a positive outlook for 2018 and beyond with growth expectations in the high single digits. Driving the market are three important dynamics; smart everything, sophisticated hardware software interaction and the universal need for software security.", "First, the new age of smart everything or digital intelligence is unfolding rapidly. Applying machine learning to massive quantities of big data requires dedicated high-performance processing, huge storage capacity, and broad connectivity bandwidth. Innovation and investments in AI chips are growing rapidly moreover digitization and early results in verticals such as automotive, industrial, medical, financial, virtual reality and many others are readily visible.", "The race is very much home and Synopsis is front and center with tools and IP to support the development of extremely advanced machine learning chips. Second, the intersection of dedicated high-performance hardware with vast amounts of sophisticated software is at the core of both challenges and opportunities manifested in particular with systems companies. Simply stated, faster compute enables more sophisticated software and rapidly advancing software demands still faster compute. The intersection of hardware and software is the center of gravity of Synopsis strategy and verification, emulation and prototyping.", "And third, the proliferation of connected devices across virtually every aspect of life makes finding security vulnerabilities early in the software development process an imperative. This is certainly paramount for systems that touch human life society's infrastructure and high value industrial and financial system. Here too Synopsis has carved out a unique technical and market leadership position and our Software Integrity Group has been growing well.", "Summarizing the opportunities, Synopsis is in a position today to address all of these dynamics and participate in this exciting way. We have a unique combination of leading technologies reaching from Silicon to Software with particular emphasis on the intersection of the two. Our company is global with a strong and experienced feel and support team and over the years we've executed well while having the courage to invest in adjacent growth opportunities ahead of the curve.", "Now to some Q1 product highlights spanning Silicon to Software. At the foundation of Silicon, Synopsis continues to help drive the development of state of the art new technologies enabling the most complex chips. FinFET designs require highly advanced performance, area, yield, and low power capabilities. As a pioneer and leader in FinFIT the design enablement, we are relying on for over 90% of these chips. Supporting development of the most advanced devices, our TCAD, technology computer aided design continues to advance to smaller and smaller circuits. Now including five, three and two nanometer nodes.", "These dimensions traditional TCAD needs to evolve in order to simulate individual layers of atoms. Over the last two years, Synopsis has invested in this capability and our TCAD is now capable of doing so-called atomistic simulation. Our digital design platform centered around synthesis, place and route and sign off continues to drive advanced customer results and growth.", "During the quarter, we won a business-critical AI targeted design and had a significant competitive displacement at a high-profile US systems company both driven by excellent low power results. Success with advanced process technology also continues. One example was a competitive win on an ARM CPU implementation in China driven by better total power consumption results. Reflecting the compelling benefits of integration of physical verification into our core digital flow IT house known for its A6 for industrial automotive and medical technology selected IC Validator replacing incumbent tools.", "Our custom analog product group also posted a strong quarter. Custom Compiler continues to grow, we've made inroads into larger Asian semiconductor companies expanding our footprint versus the incumbent. In addition, demand for our mixed signal simulation in memory and automotive segments is high as customers accelerate their move into next generation DRAM and 3D NAND memory design.", "Now to verification where we continue to deliver outstanding results and grow. Our Verification Continuum platform is the most comprehensive solution in the market today utilizing the fastest engines across the board and with the number one position in both software and hardware verification. In Q1 our franchise VCS simulator displaced the incumbent at a marquee US systems company and a large broad-based semiconductor provider.", "Our hardware based ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping again delivered very strong growth and broad-based customer adoption. In Q1 ZeBu deployments included leading companies such as AMD, Broadcom, HiSilico and NXP.", "In addition, we announced a partnership with the French alternative energies and atomic energy commission, a key player in technology research. The partnership enables advancements of ZeBu as the leading SOC emulation tool for the European automotive industry. Moving to our IP product, we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth with strength across the board. Our excellent results are derived from the high reliability and quality of our broad portfolio of interface, memory, analog, security and processor IP along with our very skilled and dedicated global support teams.", "Over the past several months, we further expanded our IP portfolio with the acquisitions of Kilopass and Sidense augmenting our non-volatile memory offering. Solid adoption of our security IP continues, with significant wins at several leading semiconductor companies, one of which is using our IP for its high-value autonomous driving SoCs. Also in automotive, we see continued traction of our embedded vision processor and certified interfaces.", "Let me pause for a moment on automotive. While many verticals are racing towards a world of smart everything, automotive is simultaneously moving to car electrification and autonomous driving, while having to maintain and extend safety and security requirements. The tongue-and-cheek quip of the car becoming a computer on wheels is actually not an exaggeration at all. In the last few years, we have therefore significantly increased our focus on this sector.", "Today a growing customer base, ranging from car OEMs, to tier 1 suppliers, to semiconductor providers, to AI chip and algorithm specialists, rely on Synopsys across our EDA, IP and Software Integrity platforms. Synopsys tools are used to address critical safety and security requirements across the automotive development lifecycle, including virtual prototyping and verification to aid in system development, safety-standard certified IP, ISO certified EDA tools, optical solutions for automotive lighting, and software security testing to drive secure, high-quality code.", "Which leads me to our Software Integrity group, whose goal it is to provide products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle, and across the entire cyber supply chain. Our strategy to accomplish this is two-fold. First, offer a Software Integrity platform that covers a broad range of programming languages and security testing solutions. In this highly fragmented market, with scores of point tools for sale, a comprehensive platform from a global, reliable supplier is highly valuable.", "And second, provide company leaders with high-level consulting and benchmarking to help them assess their current threat environment, and devise plans of attack to address the security problem throughout their software development process.", "In the last four years, we've systematically built our Software Integrity Group to critical mass through both organic execution and strategic acquisitions. Top off by the acquisition of Black Duck this quarter, our brand is solidifying, and industry experts are recognizing the strength of Synopsys' strategy and portfolio.", "At this point, we've been rated by Gartner as a Leader in their Magic Quadrant for application security testing. Just last quarter, we were also named a Leader in the Forrester Wave for static application security testing, while we also achieved a Leadership designation in IDC's Marketscape for quality analysis. These recognitions make a difference, as they facilitate gaining access to the top levels of company executives across many industries. We experienced product strength across the board and continued to close large new and renewal contracts with companies and industries ranging from financial service to automotive. Our consulting business group is working at capacity, and the value of our engagement is steadily increasing.", "As mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Black Duck, a leader in open source testing for both security vulnerabilities and license compliance. The integration is progressing smoothly with bookings and revenue well on track. The highly respected Black Duck brand and market position have also brought further positive attention to Synopsys as the emerging software quality and security company.", "In summary, we started fiscal 2018 on a strong note, exceeding expectations and raising our full-year guidance; we're seeing very good momentum with our EDA platforms, continued strength and expansion of our IP portfolio, and excellent progress in Software Integrity as we continue to invest and broaden our TAM in this emerging market.", "Let me now turn the call over to Trac.", "Trac Pham", "Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 results were very strong and we continue to see good momentum in the business. Our financial results met or exceeded our expectations across all key metrics. Let me provide a few highlights from the quarter. We achieved our highest quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to date, even when excluding the impact of an extra fiscal week, which contributed $46 million to revenue and $0.07 to EPS.", "We also initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, continuing our commitment to a balanced strategy of internal investments, M&A for long-term growth, and buybacks. Based on our record Q1 operating performance and the favorable new corporate tax rate, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, we are raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlook.", "Now to the numbers, as I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 18% to $769 million. The results were above our guided range and reflects strength across our broad product portfolio. Excluding the extra week in Q1, revenue grew 11%. The weighted average license duration was approximately three years, which we forecast to be our annual average as well.", "Total GAAP costs and expenses were $662 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $573 million, with operating margin at 25.5% percent. GAAP earnings per share were negative $0.02 cents, reflecting a one-time, GAAP-only expense due to tax reform. The impact was two-fold; a $46 million write-down of our deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. statutory rate, and a one-time transition tax of $73 million on our offshore earnings that remained after we repatriated cash in Q4. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.10, a 17% increase that includes an $0.08 benefit from a lower non-GAAP tax rate.", "Let me pause for a moment on taxes. Because of the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate, our non-GAAP rate decreased from 19% to 13% for fiscal 2018. As certain parts of U.S. tax reform and various international changes take effect in fiscal 2019, we expect the non-GAAP rate to increase next year. At this time, we expect the rate to be below our previous 19% normalized rate, but we are still working through the details and will provide a more definitive projection later in the year.", "Operating cash outflow was $59 million for the quarter, due to our normal year-end incentive ", "compensation payout, partially offset by strong collections. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $606 million with 24% onshore, and total debt of $572 million. Including the $200 million ASR that we launched in Q1, our trailing twelve-month buyback as a share of free cash flow is greater than 100%. We have $200 million remaining on our current authorization and are reaffirming our goal of using buybacks and keep share count roughly flat with last year.", "M&A was also a significant use of cash in the quarter, as we closed two acquisitions, Black Duck and Kilopass. As we mentioned in December, we expect Black Duck to contribute roughly $55 million to $60 million in revenue, which reflects a purchase-accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million to $25 million. We expect it to be $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven in the second half of 2019, and be accretive thereafter.", "Before I turn to guidance, I'll briefly comment on the upcoming transition from Accounting Standard Topic 605 to Topic 606, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019 beginning in November. Because the actual impact of the transition will depend on future bookings throughout this year, we cannot provide concrete guidance on the expected impact. However, based on what we know now and our expectations for the year, we expect the revenue impact to be immaterial. We will provide more definitive commentary with our fiscal 2019 guidance. And as a reminder, this is an accounting change only, and will not impact our cash flow or how we think about our business.", "Now to second quarter and updated fiscal 2018 guidance. As we mentioned in December, we expect first half revenue and earnings to be greater than the second half. Because of a shift in timing of customer hardware requirements, Q2 is expected to be even stronger than our original expectations, creating a more pronounced difference between first and second half. As you've seen in the past couple of years, as our hardware revenue has grown, the profile of revenue has become more variable and will fluctuate due to changes in customer schedules.", "For Q2, the targets are revenue between $765 million and $790 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $637 million and $653 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $575 million and $585 million. Other income between minus $1 million and positive $1 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, outstanding share between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.69 to $0.77 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.06 to $1.10 per share.", "For 2018, the revised guidance are revenue of $2.92 billion to $2.95 billion, an increase of $40 million over our previous target. Other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $2 million, and annualized non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $1.59 to $1.69 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $3.67 to $3.74 per share, due to the favorable effects of tax reform. Capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million.", "To summarize, we delivered a record quarter for revenue and non-GAAP earnings. Based on our excellent Q1 performance and strong 2018 outlook, amplified by favorable tax reform, we're raising our guidance for 2018. Finally, we continue to execute well on our capital allocation strategy striking an appropriate balance of organic and inorganic investments, plus returning capital to shareholders, to drive sustainable, long-term value.", "With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Gary Mobley", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong start to the year.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Gary Mobley", "So, if I do the math right it looks like if you adjust for the additional week in Q1, your guidance implies the second half that is what 6% lower than the first half and could you give any - confirm that first of all and give us the parameters that is causing you to be so conservative with respect to second half?", "Aart de Geus", "That's right Gary, you are looking at the first half that is going to be stronger than the second half. I would characterize the second half has been weak as more just a fact that the timing of our hardware shipments has skewed more to the first half as a result of what the customer schedules are requiring.", "Gary Mobley", "And just to confirm, so Software Integrity Group on pace for what roughly $260 million considering the purchase accounting headwind and what roughly $300 million without the headwind.", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we haven't disclosed the exact numbers. We've given you pretty good hints as we acquired different companies over the years. All of this area is growing above 20% per year organically and of course the acquisitions have accelerated to that. Fundamentally you're in the right ballpark, but we don't disclose the specifics. But I would say that our sense is that this business has definitely reached critical mass, meaning that the ingredients that we have, the technical position but also our ability to leverage the acquisitions well in the field support the customer as well on a global basis has definitely strengthened substantially and this quarter for us was a very clear sign that the group is well managed and that we see upside going forward.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay. I'm assuming your guidance included the consideration for the additional week, so considering that it looks like you reported roughly by 2% of revenue upside and organic revenue growth of 11%. And can you point out one or two factors that are driving the revenue acceleration of the revenue upside for the quarter?", "Trac Pham", "Gary, you're right. The guidance did include the extra week and your calculations in the ballpark. I would say that across the board is very good quarter, we had good growth across all the business lines. We did see little bit more strength in the Software Integrity business and to a less extent hardware as well.", "Gary Mobley", "Okay. I'll hop in the queue. Thank you, everyone.", "Aart de Geus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Rich Valera. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Rich Valera", "Thank you. Just following-up on that same line of questioning. Core EDA was particularly strong in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Can you highlight what were some of the drivers of the strength in the core EDA business?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, I think it's useful to start with the big picture which is fundamentally we're still in a very strong high-tech market and specifically semiconductor related market for really no surprising reasons the acceleration towards the world changing towards a smart everything investment sets that will literally impact every vertical is continuing.", "Now, I think we will over the year see some up and down for semiconductors which is normal but in aggregate it's sort of a strong phase of the industry within that every aspect of our business is putting to tasks to actually help with this and it starts with the fact that there's a whole bunch of new chips being designed specifically in AI on the premise that while general computing has brought us reasonably far and graphics chips have moved it even further.", "If one could create chips now that we're still much faster one could still do much more AI and I think that will continue and so that's where we see new entrants, we see investments in sophisticated chips and across the board both in the design side in the IP and the verification all of this is pretty much all in the state of the art FinFET group. So that drives pretty much the whole front.", "Rich Valera", "Got it. And then Trac was any of the $40 million that you raise the guidance by from the couple of small acquisitions you made I think Kilopass and Phoenix?", "Trac Pham", "No, it was not. I mean, I'm sorry to a modest extent but from the most part organic growth.", "Rich Valera", "And sort of similarly, it looks like if you lower the tax rate by the 6% roughly there that you'd get around I think $0.26 of benefit. You're raising your EPS guide by a bit less than that. Are you kind of electing to reinvest a little bit of that upside from the tax rate into the business or is there may be a little dilution from those acquisitions?", "Trac Pham", "I wouldn't turn it to the dilution. From the most part, we're off to a good start for the year with the results in Q1. We're giving the best outlook we have at this point based on our visibility. And I think that's pretty early in the year, so we've got several questions left to deliver on.", "Rich Valera", "Fair enough. Thanks. Congratulations on the nice quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I apologize Mr. Valera was from Needham and Company. The next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Brent Thielman", "Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Brent Thielman for Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on your IP business, how much of it is it currently ratable up front?", "Trac Pham", "I'm sorry, we missed that question.", "Brent Thielman", "On your IP business, how much of that business is currently ratable versus upfront?", "Trac Pham", "I would say more than two-thirds of that is time based and I'm being specific about time base rather than ratable because there's a good portion of consulting or consulting business that is recognized on a percentage of completion basis.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. Thank you. And then Asia Pacific was actually the only reason that declined sequentially during the quarter, can you give us any color as to how China is doing in particular in the Software Integrity business side and then are there any emerging trends that are perhaps different from the rest of the geography?", "Trac Pham", "You know, I think looking at the quarter-by-quarter in our business while may be giving you some insight is actually not the best way to look at Synopsis. Everything we ourselves always look at is at a minimum of trailing 12-month basis and if you did that for Asia Pacific, you would find that it's far and away the highest growing region and China in general is one of the hard drivers, positive drivers for that.", "So, I would not read anything into a specific quarter at all. Fundamentally, we're doing extremely well in those areas.", "Brent Thielman", "Okay. Great, thank you. And then one last question regarding M&A. Over the past year and a half given opportunistically acquiring a few companies in IT and software. How are those trailing under your current portfolio and then how are those being integrated at this time?", "Trac Pham", "Well, you know the integration is something that we already look at during the process of doing the acquisition because fundamentally we try to follow what we call the rule of adjacency which is trying to find businesses that are different from what we have, but close enough to minimize risks and leverage what we have and the adjacency falls into the technical adjacency, channel adjacency or customer adjacency.", "And so, from that perspective, the minute a new team joins us we try to integrate quickly all the infrastructure functions, all the business functions when it makes sense and when it goes to the same customers typically the same sales people deal with it and this is a process of making sure that that it's like two trains in movements merging at the same time and doing that without losing any of the speed, I guess there is some Olympic analogy here somewhere.", "And so, I think we've done quite well with these acquisitions and to take the largest one that is ongoing Black Duck right now, while it is not all that long ago that we closed. We can already say that it has had a very positive impact on our relationship with customers because Black Duck has an outstanding market position, but also an outstanding brand. And it fits very well and is extremely complimentary to what we already have and so that's a good example of what we try to do in the different areas and you were correct to highlight that we did a number of those in the Software Integrity Group as well as in the IP group and it's essentially the same story there.", "Brent Thielman", "All right great. Thank you and then one last one if I, one quick follow up if I could. I guess with the amount of cash that you have right now in hand, what are the pieces of technology are you looking to acquire over the next several months?", "Trac Pham", "Well this is one of those questions where we always mumble our way through it, as we don't really want to indicate what our next steps are. Let me just generalize it, as you know over the years we have never been shy to acquire but we're also not shy to invest ourselves and so we try to do balance between R&D investments and acquisitions to keep us on the leading edge and also to allow us to sometimes enter domains that would take too long to do on our own.", "And this is only possible if one continually looks at the opportunities around the vast majority of the things that one may be interested in actually never materialized and such a relatively small percentage that ultimately gets acquired but that percentage is harvested over a long period of time. And so, we're on the lookout but we won't necessarily give you the next names yet.", "Brent Thielman", "Alright. Thanks a lot.", "Trac Pham", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open please go ahead.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the result. My first question is regarding the tax reform. We have the tax reform passed recently and as part of that now you have access to all your ongoing free cash flow generation without worrying about what's onshore versus offshore. So, how are you thinking about the capital structure of the company and is there any change in how you view the business given the tax reform in the onshore versus offshore cash submission?", "Trac Pham", "Hi Farhan, this is Trac. So, you're right. The tax reform does provide more flexibility to us however, if you look at our history over the years we've done a pretty job of balancing on between investing in the business while doing buybacks and acquisitions. That's been fairly successful to-date, so I would expect that we continue on that path.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And then one question just on the linearity of the yields and I look at the guidance, the guidance for the full year, the second half fiscal seems like you are pretty much flat year-on-year for revenue growth. How much of it is conservatism versus just something really going on with the hardware business, because it seems like the growth has been more than 10% for about six quarters and now suddenly you are going from like 14% implied in the quarter you have brought to basically 0% in second half of the year?", "Aart de Geus", "I would first point you to the guidance for the full year where we've raised our revenue range for the year from 7% to 8% growth. I think that's very healthy growth. What you are seeing in the second half is just the shift of the time in hardware, I wouldn't characterize it as being conservative or just anything wrong with the software business.", "As I said in our initial remarks we're seeing very good execution across all of our businesses whether you're talking by products or by region. So, it's just a function of profiling of course in the quarter.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Got it. And just one gridlock question. Have you given any thought to starting to report your Software Security business? It's obviously becoming almost like 10% of your revenues and it's not yet profitable. So, it's kind of I would argue that we are not getting any credit for it in terms of how investors are looking at the business.", "So, have you given any thought to just expediting the business or at least in the sense from a segment reporting point of view?", "Trac Pham", "Yes, this year we are very much focused on integrating Black Duck and executing that plan. We're excited about the fact that we are hitting critical mass in that space and throughout this year as we evaluate how best to manage that business the reporting I think will fall out of that. So, we'll have more to describe later in the year as we have more clarity on that.", "Farhan Ahmad", "Thank you. That's all I have.", "Trac Pham", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to start with the upfront revenue just want to make sure you talk strength in ZeBu, was the hardware the main component in the upside and the upfront revenue in the quarter or was there strength in other parts as well?", "Trac Pham", "As I said previously, there were strength across the board. But when, if you're looking at the upfront portion specifically that's where hardware will show up.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. But relative to your expectations how would you characterize the strength in that revenue line. How much do you see or you think was hardware versus other items?", "Trac Pham", "Marginally. I think most of the upside was across very good strength across all of the businesses.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then given the transition tax and other, can you just talk about the cash flow in the quarter what items may have kind of weighed down the cash flow in the quarter and obviously a good deferred revenue contribution. But what were the things that maybe took away from some of the cash flow strength?", "Trac Pham", "Yes. For Q1 specifically, keep in mind that's when we payout our variable comp from last year. So that really weighs mostly on the Q1 results. Sterling is that what you are referring to?", "Sterling Auty", "Yes. But even looking at it on a seasonally adjusted basis, it was more than I would have expected. So, I don't know if there was actually cash tax payment timing with repatriation or other items that maybe would have weighed on cash flow in the first quarter.", "Trac Pham", "No, the biggest part is that we typically do see a negative outflow in Q1 related to variable comp. There are some other puts and takes, but that would be the largest component of that.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And then last question again, just around cash flow. You are raising the full year revenue by $40 million, but you're leaving the cash from operations range unchanged. Is there anything to be read into that?", "Trac Pham", "No, it's really frankly early in the year and cash flow typically is the hardest one, hardest metric for us to project. Keep in mind that when you look at the full year that there's a few unusual items, last year we had a one-time benefit from a $30 million for a top tech and then this year we've got a couple of unusual items that we've highlighted before.", "So, at this point we're off to a good start but it is pretty early to make a call on cash flow.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay, thank you.", "Trac Pham", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "Thanks. Good evening. Aart let me come back to the question regarding core EDA software momentum, Rich asked about that earlier. And the question is this historically if you go back over the last two or more decades in EDA, when there's been a good product category the momentum was lasted rough average two to three years and then things begin to cool for a particular category at least that's the history. We've now seen for the last one to two years or longer some good momentum and implementation for synthesis which specifically helps you and a couple of other categories.", "And so, the question is, is there something different now that might suggest that certain categories that have already had one or two good years of momentum might just keep going contrary to perhaps historical trends with regard to specific categories?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, in many ways we have long moved beyond the individual products determining what quarters look like or even years as companies such as ourselves our defacto providing much more complete solutions and an intersect with our customers on the basis of multi-year agreements.", "And so, both of those comments both lead to the same thing, which is its fundamentally smoothest curves and makes them more stable and that is also supported by the fact that for some of the very large customers stability of relationship in both directions is very important because one tends to not see under the numbers the fact is also very big human interaction by virtue of support and being on the most advanced projects almost on equal terms with the employees of the customer.", "And so, well certainly certain technology drives are related to new needs I don't think that the renewal of certain products are necessarily driving big waves. If I can highlight an example of a new need though, in verification we have seen substantial high growth rate now for multiple years in the whole area of trying to prototype systems in a combination of software and hardware or more and more hardware and that's relates to truly a problem that is growing and that is the problem of can you get the software to run on the hardware before you have the hardware because once you have the hardware, you don't want to wait for the software to be debugged or fully optimized.", "And I think that is an area that will continue to grow and is of super high interest also when you look at all the AI processors that have one objective, run software faster than before. And so, that would be essentially the gradual coming about of a new category but even there it's sort of grew out of software simulation before it became hardware. But overall, we've seen a continual growth of our run rate across the board and I think it's just we are in good technology times right now.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer", "I'll ask my two remaining questions together so both for you. So, number one, one of the things that we've seen from the geo-perspective that's really interesting over the last one to two years is the recovery in Japan. Your numbers are looking better sequentially and year-over-year on a trailing 12 basis in Japan and it broadly true for the industry and certainly if that's the opposite of what had been a very long draught for EDA in that market. And so, the question is what's changed there and you think that keeps going?", "And then lastly, just a year ago you bought Cigital as a necessary step to provide services for SIG and how are you thinking about the long-term services intensity of that business? You got the nucleus of services just over a year ago with that acquisition, but do you think over time or for at least the time being SIG becomes more services intense or perhaps might have become services intense over time?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, two very different questions. Starting with Japan, you are absolutely correct that it used to be called the lost decade and I think the added and it became the lost decade in which Japan went to really really tough hi-tech times and a renewal of workforce recombination or consolidation of many companies that had many cuts and itself a little bit like the beatings will stop when the morale improves. I think the good news is, I think the morale has improved, they are in the number of companies' sort of fresh, more modern, more western organized managements that is looking at growing the businesses.", "And so, it feels better in Japan still if I look at our numbers it's still the slowest growing region in the world over at least trailing 12 months area. I think that there is more rebound possible in Japan, but it took literally a redo of the hi-tech industry I would say.", "Regarding Cigital, the service group is very much focused on managed services which is the ability to not necessarily be physically apt a customer but deliver it over the crowd. And secondly, I think the services will continue for quite a while because the problem statement of what does security mean and how do you do it is one that is not only evolving rapidly by a constant new vulnerabilities that also demands a degree of sophistication that many companies don't half and therefore the quality educations of the seventies and eighties are now replaced by the security educations of the 2010 and with that I think we can not only align better with customers but ourselves or learn what it's like to have to modify companies from within with our tools and I think it's very well aligned with the rest of our business.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from KeyBanc services. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Monika Garg ", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. First track on the operating margin side, you've raised your revenue guidance 7.5%, the midpoint somewhere 7.5% to 8%. But if we model as what you've guided your operating margins would be down almost 130, 140 basis points year-over-year. Why are we not seeing more leverage in the margins?", "Trac Pham", "You know Monika, we can go through the model with you in more specific details. But right now, the way we're managing is to keep margins relatively flat with last year. And then excluding the impact of Black Duck as we've commented previously organic margins would have gone up to absorb that dilution.", "Monika Garg", "Okay. And then, if I look at all those software security acquisitions you have done Black Duck, Cigital all the previous ones. If I add all of them together, when do think this company, this whole business together it could be breakeven and profitable?", "Aart de Geus", "Well, we are essentially executing on the same business algorithm with each acquisition, which is these acquisitions typically come in either not being profitable or needing substantial investments because there's great growth opportunity and we followed the sort of same recipe which is a; we have to deal with the accounting haircut and b, with the integration cost and the potential desire to invest have always the same objective turn each of these acquisitions positive from a profitability point of view within the first 18 to 24 months.", "And I would say we're on track with all of those. And at the same time, this is a business that clearly has great long-term opportunity and having been able to assemble in about four years a really strong position, I think bodes really well for the long-term return of value to the company.", "Monika Garg", "And then the last one here, Aart you had talked about some new cases in autonomous driving could you talk in detail how Synopsis is looking to deploy and develop AI machine learning solutions and then can you talk about IP vision processing, talk about if your customers who are looking to develop solutions with the same any design wins you can share? Thank you.", "Aart de Geus", "Sure. Well let me take the gel topic of AI and we are both a participant and user ourselves and of course a supporter in many ways of the development and the advancement of AI. As a user, we have a number of projects that we apply to our own tools with an objective to see which one of the AI algorithms can actually make the tools run faster or better or diagnose things more smoothly and there's a host of projects that I won't go into here but look promising.", "And at the same time, I think there's also a learning curve to see which one of these projects has the highest return on investment. As a supporter, we touch many aspects and for starters, I mentioned it earlier we have now seen a rapid progression of some successful AI algorithms on general processors to the graphics processors to now specialized processors. And I was talking just two weeks ago to one of the CTOs of companies that's developing one of the most advanced AI processor cores in the world for sure and he was saying a lot unbelievably promising because here they can do our computations that are probably going to be 100 to 1000 times faster than what was possible before except they really want another billion times faster.", "And that certainly [ph] how I feel about it which is that we have opened the door to a category of computations that in the long long term aims to rival what's fundamentally the human brain can do and in order to do that you need a degree of computation that is not anywhere close to what we have today and therefore I think the enhancements are going to continue at a very very rapid pace for a long period of time. So, in that context these people all very quickly navigate to the most advanced silicon to the launch largest possible chips they can design and by the way they wanted on market yesterday therefore they're in a hurry and those are perfect customers for our tools, for our IT, and for our support.", "In addition to that, in order to check this thing out, they want to run software on mock ups of prototypes and by the way the software has to be secured too. So, sort of everything we touch is somehow in the soup and we're trying to stir it as fast as we can. But it's certainly very interesting to see how rapid the evolution of learning is in this field.", "Monika Garg", "Thank you so much.", "Trac Pham", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Mitch Steves", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I had two, kind of first on the Software Integrity side. So, now that you guys have a lot of assets and there you are getting close to kind of a $0.25 billion dollars of revenues. Is there any sort of seasonality to be aware of in terms of the combined entity just so we get a clarity on kind of the seasonality except for the full year?", "Trac Pham", "Hi Mitch, the Software Integrity business won't really effect seasonality. It's mostly time based and so, you will see variations driven by that business on the margin.", "Mitch Steves", "Yes, does that include the deferred write-off in all that as well?", "Trac Pham", "Yes.", "Mitch Steves", "Okay. And then the second one was kind of just in terms of the overall markets. So, based on what Aart was saying it sounds like the entire industry is kind of hits critical mass, so what would be the rough market share you guys think you have and then what is the total addressable market the entire Software Integrity portfolio at this time?", "Trac Pham", "You know, I was just looking at That a few minutes ago and I concluded for myself over and over again. Even determining what the TAM really is, is virtually impossible. We can put a number right now at about $2 billion or so, but to be honest I'm not sure that how many of the software companies in the world this encompasses that sooner or later are going to run into the necessity to have their software checked out for vulnerabilities.", "And this is where it ties actually indirectly to electronics. Electronics in simultaneously connecting pretty much everything in the world to everything else therefore everything is a potential entry point for vulnerabilities and no matter how innocuous sales from software is in some coffee maker or god knows what you know once it's connected to a network somewhere it can be an entry point.", "And therefore, I think that the notion of software quality and security will continue to just broaden itself. Now having said that of course the market doesn't grow infinitely fast and I think we are in a good position because we have found this combination of organic growth from M&A growth, but most importantly to try to build a position that is strong for the long term and is trusted for the long-term. And that implies being able to execute well against needs of the customer. [Technical Difficulty].", "Operator", "Hi, this is Susan, the operator. I apologize I got disconnected. It is at the five-minute mark, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to your host.", "Aart de Geus", "Okay. Well, let me apologize for what happened, we have no idea what it was but you probably heard the same beeping and I just came down, I guess this is the beeping of the end of this event. So, let me thank you for participating you heard hopefully that we executed well this corner and feel good about Q2 and the year's outlook.", "And as usual, I will be available for the individual comments in the aftermath. Apologize again for the abrupt ending, but we appreciate your participation.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our conference. We thank you for your participation today and for your patience and also for using AT&T executive teleconference.
