Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman, Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2012 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you Mike, and good morning everyone. Net operating income for the second quarter was $133 million or $0.42 per share, a per share increase of 9% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $134 million or $44 per share also a 9% increase on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of June 30 was 15.6% and our book value per share was $36.73 a 2% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share remained flat $41.19.", "In our life insurance operations, the premium revenue grew 5% to $475 million and life underwriting margins increased 9% to $136 million. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due to lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the deferral of certain great response and acquisition costs that previously have not been deferred. Lower amortization rate is a result of improvements and consistency attributable to our ongoing conservation program and is incorporated in our guidance for the full year. Brian will discuss the deferrable within the net cost in just a few minutes. Finishing life, net life sales increased 2% to $91 million.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, increased 23% to $280 million. And health underwriting margin grew 25% to $50 million. Improvement in health premium and underwriting margin was due primarily to the addition of Family Heritage. Health sales increased 88% to $24 million also due primarily to the acquisition of Family Heritage.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on insurance operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you Gary. First let\u2019s discuss American Income. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $178 million and life underwriting margin was also up 5% to $57 million. Net life sales increased 2% for the quarter to $41 million. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,540 up 4% from a year ago but down 1% during the quarter.", "Our net sales increased less than we expected for the second quarter we 1, 5.49 (inaudible). We\u2019re pleased the first quarter sales decline has reversed I believe this agency is moving in the right direction. American Income has had a long history of stair-step growth and continued adjustments have always been needed to ensure long term agency growth. We continue to make changes to address new agent retention and agent productivity. And we\u2019re adding new SGA\u2019s in certain existing territories. We have large offices with solid growth rates.", "We expect sales growth for the full year 2013 to range from 3% to 6%. Now Direct Response. And our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $169 million and life underwriting margin increased to 24% to $43 million. Net life sales were up 3% to $40 million.", "Response rates began to improve during the second quarter and as we mentioned last quarter we\u2019re confident that our new initiatives will help further increase response rates in 2013. We introduced rate adjustments and higher face amount offerings on adult products late in the second quarter. We expect mid-single-digit sales growth for the full year 2013.", "Now, Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined to 2% to $69 million while life underwriting was down 1% to $17 million. Net life sales grew 2% to $8 million while net health sales declined 5% to $3 million.", "The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at a 1,283 down 5% from a year ago and down 7% during the quarter. While the agent count was down we continue to make progress with the turnaround at Liberty National as we\u2019ve said many times this is going to be a slow process. The changes we had made have begun to improve agent productivity as life sales increased during the second quarter despite the decline in agent count.", "With regard to the agent count, geographic expansion into more urban areas is the key to growth of Liberty National. We opened four new offices in the second quarter and we plan to open three more this year. We expect this to generate long term agent and sales growth. Sales growth is expected to range from 2% to 5% for the full year 2013.", "Now, Family Heritage. Health premiums were $48 million and health net sales were $11 million. As we previously indicated, we intend to grow this agency through geographic expansion and implementation of our internet recruiting program. For 2013, we expect health premium income to range from $189 million to $193 million with margins as a percentage of health premium of about 18% to 20%. We expect sales of approximately $46 million to $48 million in 2013.", "Our sales guidance is slightly lower than before, this agency continues to show steady and sequential growth in the agent count and health sales for being integrated into Torchmark.", "Medicare Part D. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 6% to $73 million, our underwriting margin decreased 1% to $8 million. Part D sales for the quarter fell 63% to $8 million due to the decrease in low-income subsidized enrollees for 2013.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned before, we aren\u2019t receiving as many new auto-enrollees under the low-income subsidy program in 2013 as we did in 2012, so we don\u2019t have the type of sales and premium growth we had in 2012. We expect a decrease of approximately 5% to 7% percent in our Part D premiums for 2013 due primarily to price competition in the employer group market that we\u2019ve discussed previously.", "I would now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "To complete the discussion of insurance operations, administrative expenses were $44.1 million for the quarter, 11% more than the year ago. The increase is in line with our expectations and is due primarily to the addition of Family Heritage. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses in 2013, should be around the same level as 2012. Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations.", "First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $55 million a decline of $8 million or 12%; 8% on a per share basis from the second quarter of 2012. These to clients, due to lower new money yield, and the call of $467 million to hybrid securities since June 30 of 2012.", "For the full year 2013, we expect the decline in excess investment income to be approximately 7% to 8%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect 2013 excess investment income per share to be down around 3% compared to 2012.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $12.8 billion, including $12.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $11.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $585 million, compared to $764 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.8% compared to 6.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3\u00bd times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 17%, which is less than most of our peers.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, compared to BBB+ a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $652 million compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. The decrease in unrealized gains is due to primarily to recent increases in market interest rates rather than credit concerns.", "Regarding investment yield, in the second quarter we invested $305 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and utility sectors.", "We invested at an average yield of 4.07% an average rating of A- and an average life of 26 years. The new money yield decrease is by the increase in treasure rates during the second quarter due to the following reasons. First on a one time basis we invested $43 million for Family Heritage in securities with shorter maturities than usual with asset liability management considerations. Had this money been invested longer term, the average yield on total acquisitions for the quarter would have been around 4.2%.", "Also contributing to a lower new money rates is that most of our investments we made early in quarter, the correction rates were actually lower than they were in the first quarter. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.95% down 48 basis points from the 6.43% yield in the second quarter 2012. Of this decline in yield, 14 basis points was due to the addition of Family Heritage and 13 basis was due to the $467 million of bank hybrids called since June 30 of 2012.", "On the last call we indicated that we still have approximately earned $59 million of bank hybrids expected to be called in 2013. In the second quarter $63 million were called. In addition we\u2019ve determined another $20 million is now unlikely to be called, leaving $76 million of those bank hybrids that we expect to be called. As of today, we have now received a notice of intent to call on any of these securities.", "However, if all $76 million of these securities are called the lost annual income would be approximately $1 million after tax. On past analyst calls we have discussed the details of the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a \u201clower for longer\u201d rate scenario. As discussed our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates is an impact on earnings not the GAAP or statutory balance sheets.", "Even so Torchmark would continue to earn a substantial excess investment income in an extended lower interest rate environment. We are encouraged by the recent increase in treasure rates due to the positive impact that higher interest rates will have on our excess investment income.", "Even certain interest rates buy to be beneficial as we have very little this intermediation risk and we\u2019re not concerned about substantial interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio. As we have said many times we have both the intent, more importantly the ability to hold our bonds in maturities.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.", "First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets: In the second quarter, we spent $90 million to buy 1.43 million Torchmark shares at an average cost of $62.77 per share. For the full year through June 30th we have spent $180 million dollars of parent company cash to acquire three million shares at an average cost of $59.26 per share.", "The available liquid assets at the parent consists of assets on hand plus the expected free cash flow from operations. As we\u2019ve said before, free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "The Parent entered the second quarter with liquid assets of $138 million including $94 million that has been invested to redeem our senior notes that mature on August 1st, 2013. Assuming shareholder dividends remain at the current level, we expect free cash flow for the remainder of 2013 to be around $206 million. Along with the $138 million of liquid assets available as of June 30th the parent will have around $344 million of available liquid assets for the remainder of the year.", "As previously noted, $94 million of these assets will be used to redeem our senior notes on August 1st and we expect to utilize approximately $20 million in other financing activities. Leaving the Parent with around $230 million of liquid assets for the remainder of the year. Of this amount we expect to retain approximately $50 million at the Parent company.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of the remainder of the funds.", "Now, Regarding RBC at our Insurance Subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last three years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Now, before I turn the call back to Larry, I would like to briefly make just a couple of comments relating to the change in the treatment of certain direct response acquisition expenses. During the second quarter we began deferring direct response advertising costs related to our internet campaign.", "As we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls direct response advertising cost quality for deferral treatment provided certain requirements in the accounting literature are met. One of these requirements is that we maintain detailed historical data to support a probable future benefit of the advertising.", "We initiated our direct response advertising through the web around 2007. Those at the time of our adoption to new accounting guidance related to the treatment of acquisition expenses in 2011. We did not have sufficient historical data to adequately support deferral of this internet related costs.", "We have been building on that data since 2011 and now have developed sufficient historical data to firmly support the deferral of these costs going forward.", "As a result of this change non-deferred to acquisition expenses related to direct response decreased approximately $4 million to $1.6 million in the second quarter. Or do about 1% of our direct response premium. For the third and fourth quarters we anticipate that the amount of non-deferred acquisition expenses for direct response will be approximately the same as in the second quarter resulting in approximately $12 million less in non-deferred acquisition expenses for the full year of 2013.", "This reduction will be offset by an increase in amortization expense over the year of approximately $1 million due to the addition of deferred expenses resulting in a net $11million reduction in total direct response acquisition expenses.", "For the full year 2013, we estimate that our underwriting margin for direct response will be approximately 25% as compared to the 23% in 2012. Overall, the effect of the change net of the increased amortization and net of income taxes was to increase our second quarter earnings per share by approximately $2.05 and has been reflected in our revised guidance.", "Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2013, we expect our net operating income will be within a range $5.60 per share to $5.75 per share. Those are our comments for this morning. We will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning. First I had a question on just the agent count, it had begun to recover and this quarter dropped at both American Income and Liberty National, Liberty is actually been down for two consecutive quarters. So the first one is just what\u2019s going on there, what\u2019s driving that. And then secondly, are you still comfortable that you could achieve your sales growth targets if the agent count doesn\u2019t begin to pick up? And then another question just on your expectations for Part D enrollments in 2014 and what type of products are you planning and now you\u2019re expecting a pickup in auto-enrollees next year.", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy, this is Larry, I\u2019ll address Liberty National first. As our new systems were implemented. We just found that agents did not meet the new activity levels required and those agents lapped the agency also a new training process is of Liberty National and the implementation and the lifetime presentation for individual sales, enrollment of its agents, but managers recruiting that within the first six months for 2013.", "Our guidance for agent relative at Liberty National is a yearend we believe the agent count at Liberty National is between 1400 and 1500 agents. At American Income, what we found is our initiatives to improve agent retention did not give us the desire results as quickly as we\u2019d hoped. Also our agent (inaudible) 0:02:45.5, needed to achieve double digit agents sales growth in the second quarter. Again we have initiatives that are changing at Liberty National and American Income, our guidance for agent growth is the year end agent count at American Income should be in the range of 5,800 to 6,000 agents.", "In terms Part D in 2014, Jimmy it\u2019s really too early to really give a guidance on 2014 Part D sales, we\u2019ve submitted our bid, but we don\u2019t see the results of those bids until October- November of this year.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then just maybe one more Family Heritage, you had the company for a few quarters now, what if then sort of the positives or negatives versus what you might have assumed initially and then what\u2019s your longer-term expectation for growth of that business.", "Larry Hutchison", "At Family Heritage the integration is going very well. We\u2019ve not lost a single agency director since the acquisition. Our internet recruiting system is coming on line at all agencies, and Family Heritage sales directors are now familiar with the system and they can manage their resume volume, in addition in response to the growth we\u2019re seeing at Family Heritage. We\u2019ve had a full time recruiting director to manage internet recruiting at Family Heritage. And Family Heritage is also we had a director of agency development, it\u2019s important for agency directors.", "Jimmy, this year we\u2019ve added approximately nine new agency directors, and again to avoid confusion in the call we talk about agency directors at Family Heritage, also the SGA\u2019s, those are the managers and other two systems for [recent term] sales director that means the new agency he had within Family Heritage. But with those \u2013 with that, with the increase in agency counts that we see sequentially, we think there is a good growth prospects at Family Heritage", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Erik Bass from Citi.", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could talk little bit about competition both in the life and health businesses. And the life side you\u2019re seeing more insurers beginning to focus on the middle market consumers. They are often using different distribution than you are. I\u2019m just wondering are you seeing that your customers have more options for purchasing insurance than had historically. And then on the health side, I\u2019ve also seen increased focus on supplemental products from some insurers and is there been any noticeable impact on pricing there?", "Larry Hutchison", "With respect to life insurance we\u2019ve not seen any impact of other insurers entering the middle income market. We are still seeing and we make presentations in our customer\u2019s homes, we\u2019re the only agent in their home. And we\u2019re not seeing any replacement activity that results from those sales. The second question I believe was health insurance. And again they are not health insurance went to niche with Family Heritage they operate in basically rural areas.", "And we\u2019re the only agent in this home making presentations metric supplement obviously is very competitive market, although we\u2019ve seen good growth in our Medicare supplement sales, energy distribution. Health sales for the new independent agents which is primary Medicare supplement growth, 17% in the quarter, and we think for the year within that agency we\u2019re going to have double digit sales growth in the independent agents size slow double digit sales growth to be 9% or 10% in that range. But again we are not seeing competition affect our sales.", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one American, you mentioned that you added some more SGA\u2019s this quarter and the opportunity to add, additional SGA\u2019s and sort of slower growth market, so just wondering what is your, and kind of what is the opportunity to add there and how much middle management capacity do you have currently to fill those roles", "Larry Hutchison", "Oh we seen there\u2019s pretty good middle management capacity because we really focused on middle management and American Income over the last two years. As we stated on the call, and on January 1st, 2013 our SGA count was 64, we\u2019ve added the eight SGA\u2019s in the second quarter we selected the SGA\u2019s in second quarter that measured probably 72. We anticipate by year-end 2013 will be at 75 SGA\u2019s, not a good guidance from last year but it\u2019s our expectation that we\u2019d be having additional SGA\u2019s next year and those areas where we don\u2019t have high growth rates, we\u2019re going to have plenty of lease, we have resumes to recruit agents who will be adding additional SGA\u2019s", "Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee, & Leach", "I think it\u2019s still good morning in Texas, good morning. And the question, I guess you two places where I want to focus. One, obviously some challenges at Liberty, but really wanted to more focus on American Income and agent count growth. So the target for year-end is largely unchanged right, despite some pressure in 2Q. And I guess I\u2019m just wondering if you could just help us understand where your confidence comes from like what are the specific efforts that have been put in place, or can you talk it also any sort of progress in July that helps us feel better about the turnaround there.", "Larry Hutchison", "John, this is Larry again it\u2019s really not July progress that we\u2019re focused on, the reason we\u2019re expecting the stronger third and fourth quarter is because the changes that we introduced in the first and second quarter really focused on increased agent activities. And we have compensation changes with progress on field agent retention. We think those are going to have a greater impact on the third and fourth quarter.", "The other change at American Income is the starting in August, we\u2019re going to introduce another compensation change at the agent level, but we balanced this level to the agents let\u2019s say a longer retention, exercises we talk about agent retention. We\u2019re not talking about 12 month agent retention, we\u2019re talking about increased agent retention in the third and fourth and fifth and sixth months through the 12 months.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee, & Leach", "Understand, okay. And then I am sorry I might ask you later.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, John, I was just going to add that yeah we as Larry alluded to, we had to make adjustments along the way. Yeah, couple of years ago we identified getting agents to level where they were getting the top bonus as it mean to growing agency and what we found is that we were getting there is supervision trying to get them to the top bonus level but we weren\u2019t staying with them or helping them to stay at their level and so that contributed to the lower retention levels. The things that Larry pointed out specially bonus at the agent level to \u2013 as they improve their tenure I think will help not only to get them \u2013 we don\u2019t have to as to get them to the level they need to be able to stay there in order to while we make it to the fourth (inaudible) they could make it about half way through the year they have a much better chance of making it through the four year.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee, & Leach", "Okay understood and then really nice rebound in direct response this quarter I know that last quarter you had talked about some initiatives there. Maybe you could help us understand sort of what\u2019s \u2013 where the success was. And in particular I know that you had talked about introducing through Globe the opportunity for higher face amounts on the life insurance side and I\u2019m wondering if you have any success with the higher face amount product?", "Larry Hutchison", "This is Larry I\u2019ll answer that two parts. The first is really, regarding response rates overall, direct response some improvement in response rates in the second quarter was frequent down a little bit the demand in June we really didn\u2019t see an improvement in response rates the circulation enquiries. But we did see a significant increase of response rates for our email campaigns and our mailing response rates were much better in the second quarter than the first quarter 2013 with the final quarter of 2012. So we\u2019re definitely seeing overall increase in response rates. I think your other question is really the rollout of our rates in our adult products and there we\u2019re seeing good early results. And that\u2019s reflected in our guidance for the third and fourth quarters of 2013.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee, & Leach", "Okay very good thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now go to a question by Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore", "Good morning. I actually want to go back to American Income as well. I guess I\u2019m just trying to put the mosaic together the sales outlook was moved from 10% to 14% down to about, 3% to 6% or whatever the number was. But you really aren\u2019t changing the outlook on agents for the year. I think you said last quarter 5900 and 6000 now you are 5800 to 6000. Why that sizable drop in sales given that the agent counters just because of the impact of the second quarter in the kind of the steeper ramp to getting back to that aging count or is there something else going on?", "Larry Hutchison", "Mark just think about 2012 versus 2013 these two years have evolved very differently. In 2012 American Income had an 18% first quarter year-over-year and 8% first quarter and then we really saw sales as agent sales have dropped to the third and fourth quarters. We sold out the year with 11%. If you look at American Income we have a negative first quarter with a 2% first quarter. So you\u2019re looking at fairly strong third and fourth quarters to still reach that range of 3% to 6%. The reason we think we\u2019re going to be able to grow this agency in 3% to 6% range is these initiatives and compensation the activity models are going to take hold in the third and fourth quarter and we\u2019ll see better results. Additionally if we add these additional SGA\u2019s that will start to boost some of the sales, some of the agent activity in the second half of 2013.", "Gary Coleman", "Excuse me. I would add to that I think in our previous guidance we anticipated the increase in production for agent that we didn\u2019t see in the second quarter. It\u2019s going to take us little bit longer to get to that productivity level. So I think that\u2019s why you may see that same number of agents but not quite most productive.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore", "Okay and then just on the direct response deferral of certain cost related to internet distribution I guess just to \u2013 I\u2019m surprised to see that this change kind of fully result in the decline in and just a quick why is that and so that\u2019s a change in estimate it\u2019s not a change in accounting principle is that right?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s right.", "Frank Svoboda", "Okay is it a change in estimate that will be applied on a going forward basis.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore", "Okay so as the \u2013 as this build up in the deferral occurs on the amortization the impact will kind of slowly ease but it will take a very long time for that to happen essentially.", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct yeah you\u2019ll see generally maybe about an 8% of the, in your first year cost will result in increase in amortization at first year and then it will be spread out over a long period of time as the premiums are collected on that business.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Evercore", "Okay alright thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our next question will come from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Yeah thank you very much. Is there any opportunity for other expenses to be deferred where you might not have adequate track records?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes but you could at some point down the road.", "Gary Coleman", "We\u2019re always taking a look to see to look at the various expenses that we have in valuating them at this point in time there are none that we you\u2019d see we\u2019re focusing on like we have been here on these internet expenses in building that historical track record.", "Larry Hutchison", "Yeah Mark I would add that we took a really hard look at that this and some of the agency expenses back in 2011 and I don\u2019t know that we \u2013 we\u2019ve seen more expenses that we can move from non-deferral to deferral there. The difference was direct response was those the deferral comes under the advertising cost rule. And those are a little bit harder to say as Frank said you really have to develop information over a long period of time. I really kind of think this is part of the last and direct response because most of the other expenses we had are non-deferred to mostly salaries at Wal-Mart these people that it can be or something I think we were set now that\u2019s how we got our expenses defined.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey good morning thanks. I just want to follow-up on that deferral thing I apologize I missed this. What is the nature of the data that\u2019s changed or you\u2019ve been able to gather that, that leads you to have a better deferral view on the internet. What is it that you\u2019ve captured in the data that changes that view?", "Gary Coleman", "What you have to do is develop enough of the historical data that shows that the expenses that you\u2019re incurring of advertising expenses that you have, result in the probable future benefit that actually exceeded the amount of expense. So you have to be able to show that the, yes so expenses result in sales and that you have overall a profit margin relating from those particular activities but they\u2019re really very similar to what we do in the insert media and these cost rates essentially the same other than rather than being in the print. These are electronic type and so at this point in time it\u2019s going to reach, we\u2019d now have just, we\u2019ve got enough history, we\u2019ve got a full five years under our belt if you will and the analysis of the data we can, we are very comfortable that we can fully support that we do in fact have this probable future benefit of profit.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Is that probable future benefits over the whole scope of that activity right that\u2019s not is it do you think they kind of hit a certain profit margin before you can say all of this activity is profitable. Because there is a lot of, there is a lot of initiative that go out that don\u2019t have the result of a successful sales. Is it like a profit margin hurdle, is that what the hurdle is?", "Gary Coleman", "Not as much of a profit margin hurdle as much as there is with the overall activity it can be shown to be that will in fact be profitable over a long period of time.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay interesting but similar to what you were able to achieve over the years with the print media that\u2019s the, that\u2019s kind of the philosophy of that?", "Gary Coleman", "Exactly.", "Larry Hutchison", "Yeah Mark we have when we applied this in 2011we had many years of experience drawn focused mail side and also the internet media side. It\u2019s just that its internet it\u2019s got just really started up we just didn\u2019t have the data there. And we probably have that and I will add to the prior question. You did have to show a profit margin to be able to defer the expenses because you\u2019ve got to be able to show that you can recover that DAC over time so it is, there is a little bit of a hurdle there from the profit margin side.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah I appreciate that just, I\u2019m more interest in it because we need the accruals. And just one other clean up question and then I apologize to you if I missed this. But Gary did you lay out kind of what the new money yield was this quarter and if you could compare that to over your last quarter I\u2019d be interested in that?", "Larry Hutchison", "I\u2019d mentioned earlier that our new money rate 4.07% for the quarter part of that reason it was lower than it was in the first quarter was the fact that we had to invest new money short at Family Heritage, one time assets liability matching thing. We really would have expected to have a higher rate than its already got us to 420 it would invest those that many long. We were expected to have a little bit higher rate but we happen to invest our money in like the first six or seven weeks of the quarter when present rates were lower than they were in the first quarter. So we missed the increase in the treasury rates later in the second quarter. But we expect that going forward we\u2019re going to invest and obviously grow to 4.07% and in our guidance will last throughout the year we\u2019re built-in that we would be investing at four and three quarters percent.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Is that four and three quarters. That\u2019s perfect thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Dan (inaudible).", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks I had two questions one on Liberty National you talked about it being a gradual process can you kind of revisit what your long term goals would be for growth and agent count and sales?", "Frank Svoboda", "Our long term growth for agent count at Liberty National as we think it is stable year-on-year our major growth were about 10%. And we know to do that we need to expand our geographic number of offices as I mentioned that we opened four new offices second quarter we\u2019re going to, between now and then in the year we\u2019re going to open traditional three offices those thing our office growth is really dependent upon we develop middle management we will expand geographically.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it thanks. And secondly your premium growth in life accelerated a bit year-over-year maybe and then part of on your conservation efforts what\u2019s in the vision in your full year 2013 guidance for life premium?", "Frank Svoboda", "See I think we\u2019re looking between 4% to 5% and I think we will roll over 5% during the quarter but I think over the four would be four to five.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Eric Berg with RBC. Hello Mr. Berg we\u2019re unable to hear you.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Could you hear me now?", "Operator", "Yes we could thank you.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Alright. Thank you I\u2019m sorry I had my phone on mute and just have this one question. The profitability of Family Heritage continues to be on the health side of course materially less than the overall underwriting margin in your health business. Now I know that was anticipated when you acquired the company last November. But what\u2019s the outlook there and in particular do you see profitability the true profitability numbers moving closer overtime?", "Frank Svoboda", "Eric we\u2019re looking at a margin around 19%, 18% to 20% for the year. That\u2019s what we expected for this type of business. And we don\u2019t expect that to change overtime. We \u2013 one thing we could \u2013 that\u2019s not reflected in the other item margin is we get a more investment income on this business because as you\u2019ll remember a lot of this is where we have a refund to premium. Future after 20 years so now we\u2019re happy with this margin and I don\u2019t see it moving up we need to match it more than the other products.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Is the margin on \u2013 is the margin on its supplemental health business as opposed to your Medicare business similar to that on the legacy towards market your existing supplemental medical margin?", "Frank Svoboda", "Eric I\u2019m not sure did you say it came by Family Heritage as supplemental \u2013", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yes I\u2019m trying to compare the profitability of Family Heritage supplemental medical business profitability to the profitability of the supplemental medical business of Torchmark other distribution agencies.", "Frank Svoboda", "I would say it\u2019s, its notable that higher than the non-med sup business in our other lines. It obviously is between its \u2013 it\u2019s more towards the Medicare supplement than it is non-med so\u2026", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Alright then thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our next question will come from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. Most asked just one question regarding I guess M&A pipeline and you changed the buyback strategy just to be a bit more I guess conservative and consistent in terms of when you\u2019ve been in the market. But is anything out there in terms of M&A that is enticing to you guys or can you remind us just what your potential actions would be in terms of what you\u2019d be looking for obviously some form of captive distribution but both maybe U.S. as well as internationally?", "Larry Hutchison", "Chris it really hasn\u2019t change over what we talked about before we do in type of companies that we would be interested in acquiring are companies that add capital to our controlled distribution it could be agencies or direct response. That are in the middle income market and selling products similar to what we\u2019re doing in the other are the lines of \u2013 those are \u2013 that\u2019s the, to talk of insurance that we\u2019re comfortable with and we want to sell. And I would say it\u2019s going to be primarily domestic at least in what we\u2019re seeing.", "We\u2019re still looking (inaudible) report any different from last quarter we\u2019ll continue to look as I mentioned before we\u2019re very pleased in buying the Family Heritage. And we\u2019ll be on the lookout for a company similar to that because that\u2019s what we\u2019re interested in, we\u2019re not interested in companies in other lines of business. It\u2019s \u2013 we want more of the type of businesses we already have.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay and is there a certain size deal you\u2019d like to try and find?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well as I mentioned before we, we do wish that the Family Heritage may be have been little bit bigger we can \u2013 there\u2019s no particular size I\u2019d say there are meters of limit to how much we can go but each deal with paying out so \u2013", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And at this time we have no further questions in the queue and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "Right.

(NYSE:TMK) Q4 2007 Earnings Call February  7, 2008 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Mark McAndrew - Chairman and Chief Exec. Officer ", "Gary Coleman - Chief Financial Officer and Exec. VP ", "Rosemary Montgomery - Chief Actuary, Exec. VP", "Analysts", "", "Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "", "Operator", "", "Good day everyone and welcome to the Torchmark Corporation Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call.", "(Operator Instructions)", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew, please go ahead sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Good morning everyone, joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary and Joyce Lane Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of my comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.  Accordingly, please refer to our 2006 10-K, which is on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $132 million dollars or $1.41 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago.  For the year, net operating income was $522 million or $5.45 a share, an increase of 9.2% on a per share basis.  Our return on equity was 15.8% and our book value per share was $36.26 a 9% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 3% to $393.5 million, and life underwriting margins increased 6% to a $108 million.  As the percentage of premium revenue, life underwriting margins were 28% versus 27% a year ago.  Life insurance net sales were $68.3 million up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2006 with our three largest life distribution channels contributing double-digit growth.", "To our knowledge this marked the first time in our history that all three of these distribution systems experienced double-digit growth in sales during the same quarter.  At American Income, life premiums grew 8% to a $114 million for the quarter.  Live underwriting margin was up 14% to $35 million.  Net life insurance sales increased 15% to $24.2 million with first year collected premiums growing 5% to $19 million.", "I am very pleased with the results of the American Income.  Sales growth improved each quarter during 2007 and we entered 2008 with significant momentum.  I now have a high level of confidence that we can sustain this positive momentum through 2008 and beyond.  The compensation changes we implemented in July at American Income appeared to have had a positive impact on both agent retention and productivity.  We are continuing to make progress in our efforts to centralize the lead generation function at American Income, which eliminates the need for exclusive territories.  We believe this change will be instrumental in achieving our long-term growth objectives.", "In our direct response operation, life premiums were up 6% to a $120 million and life underwriting margin increased 8% to $29 million for the quarter.  As expected, net life sales grew 12% to $29 million, primarily as a result of increased insert media circulation during the prior quarter.  We anticipate continued double-digit growth and direct response life sales during the first half of 2008.  Predicting sales beyond that point is difficult because it is dependent upon our ongoing efforts to find better products and packaging identify other forms of media and to better isolate our target markets.  At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $72 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $21 million.  Net life sales grew 12% for the quarter to $10.3 million.", "New sales at Liberty National were a pleasant surprise, while we implemented some significant compensation changes at Liberty National at the start of the fourth quarter; I have to give credit for this turnaround to the sales management team at Liberty National.  They have embraced the changes that we have made and they have performed well beyond my expectations.  I am excited about our growth prospects in 2008.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 2% to $252.5 million while health underwriting margin increased 1% to $46 million.  Health net sales were down 8% for the quarter to $59 million.  For the independent agency operation the United American health premiums declined 8% to $93 million and the health underwriting margin was down 6% to $16 million.  Net health sales grew 18% to $16 million as a result of a $4 million increase in our group Medicare supplement business.", "On the branch-office side, health premiums were up 3% at $96 million and health underwriting margin was also at 3% at $14 million.  Net health sales were down 18% in the branch office to $36 million and first year collected premiums were down 4% to $29.5 million.  The branch office sales were a disappointment as I mentioned on the last call.  The decline in our branch office sales has been caused by overly rapid expansion of our branch offices.", "We not only promoted significant numbers or our best producing agents in the management.  Our selection criteria for management candidates were not up to our previously established standards.  As a result of turnover and demotions, our field management ranks had declined 16% since the end of the third quarter, which has significantly impacted our new agent recruit.", "You may recall that we transferred Andy King in 2006 from the United American to become President and Chief Marketing Officer at Liberty National.  We have now assigned Andy dual responsibility for both United American and Liberty national and I am confident we will have a branch office back on track by mid-year.", "Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was down 8% for the quarter to $52 million and our underwriting margin declined 21% to $6.7 million.  For the full year Part D revenues increased 1% with a 5% decline in underwriting margin.", "Administrative expenses increased 2% for the quarter to $38.9 million but declined slightly for the full year as we expected.  Parent company expenses were up $1.9 million for the quarter, most of which, resulted from expenses related to an unsuccessful acquisition attempt during the quarter.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments on our investment operations.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing excess investment income and share repurchases.  First, investments; Torchmark has $9.3 billion of bonds at amortized cost, which comprise 94% of invested assets of our bonds, 92% of corporate bonds in hybrid securities.  Less than 1% of bonds are in residential or commercial mortgage bank securities and none of those are backed by sub-prime or mortgages.  Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-minus, the same as the year ago.", "Regarding new investments, we invested almost exclusively in investment grade corporate bonds and hybrid securities.  In the fourth quarter, we invested $348 million and an average annual effective yield of 7.09% and average life to worst call of 32 years and an average rating of A-minus.", "This compares to the 6.65% yield, 22-year average life and A-minus rating of bonds acquired in the fourth quarter of last year.  The new money yield for the quarter exceeded the portfolio yield.  However, for the full year, the new money yield was just slightly lower than the portfolio yield.", "At December 31st, the average yield on the portfolio was 6.96%, six basis points lower than a year ago.  Now, turning to excess investment income, it was $80 million the same as a year ago.  However, on a per share basis, excess investment income increased 8%, which reflects effect of our share repurchase program.  Excess investment income is net investment income less the interest cost on the net policy liabilities and the financing costs or debt.", "As mentioned in the Earnings Press Release, both investment income and interest experience were $3.6 million higher than usual in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to the pre-funding of debt that was retired late in that quarter.  For the year-over-year comparison of the components of excess investment income, I will exclude the effects of the pre-funding from the fourth quarter 2006 numbers.  With that in mind, the comparison is as follows.", "First, net investment income was up $7 million.  However, taking into consideration the $256 million of municipal bonds acquired earlier this year or earlier in 2007, total investment income on a tax-equivalent basis was up $8 million.  This represents a 5% increase of income, slightly lower than a 6% increase in average investment assets.", "Next, the interest cost on the net policy liabilities increased $5 million or 8%, due primarily to 7% increase in the average liabilities.  And lastly, financing calls were up $2 million due to higher average short-term debt and outstanding.", "Regarding our share-repurchase program, in 2007 we spent $402 million to buy $6.1 million towards market shares.  We used our $358 million of pre-cash flow and $44 million of short-term borrowings to turn these purchases.  In 2008, we expect pre-cash flow to once again be around $360 million the reason that it will be about the same as last year is that 2007 pre-cash flow included a $36 million extraordinary dividend from one of our subsidiaries.  With our debt at an appropriate level and given the low interest rate environment, we feel that the best use of our pre-cash would be a strategic acquisition.", "Absent in acquisition, stock repurchases will be the best use of our available cash.  Those are my comments.  I will now turn it back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "For 2008, we project net operating income per share will be in the range of $5.88 to $5.94 per share.  This projection assumes that we will continue to invest our free cash flow in our share repurchase program.", "Those are my comments.  I will now open it up for questions.", "Question and Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "", "We will take our first question with Jamminder Bhullar with J.P. Morgan", "Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "I have a couple of questions; the first one is on your outlook for health sales.  If you can talk about just the decline and the agent count at your branch, what caused that with your outlook as in terms of how long it is going to take for you to turn that around?  I do realize that you are making some changes.  And then, how do health sales look for the first half of the year given the decline in the agent count?", "And then, secondly on acquisition, you mentioned you have an interest in doing deals, I think the unsuccessful acquisition that you mentioned in the fourth quarter release was in the health business.  Would you then talk about which areas of your business you are targeting in terms of M&A activities and what the environments out there?", "Mark McAndrew", "First off on health sales, I do believe it will take us a couple of quarters to get our health sales turned around.  Again, we opened a substantial number of new losses in the last year and a half and we have experienced some turnover particularly to branch manager level.  I think, at the end of the third quarter we only had two openings there and by the end of the quarter, we were up to about 17.  And that has impacted our new agent recruiting.  We are working to fill those vacant seats with qualified people and I have every confidence that we will do that in the first half of this year.", "But we really think it will be the second half before we will start seeing growth in health sales.  Our guidance, I believe, for the year, even though we expect growth in our health sales in the second half of the year, we are projecting between 4% and 5% decline for the full year.", "Jamminder Bhullar - J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay and the one thing that seems interesting is in the United American Branch, your life sales are still increasing.  They have been increasing for the last several quarters, even though health sales have been weak.  Is there a product issue there or I realized that life is a small part of the business, if you can talk about that also?", "Mark McAndrew", "Again, it is something I think we have talked about in prior calls and that we did make some changes a couple of quarters back to where we made a concerted effort to try to generate more life sales in conjunction with our health sales.  Well, the people that we are selling health insurance to, basically have no health insurance and they have very little or no life insurance.  So, we are seeing more life insurance sales being made in conjunction with the health sales.  But overall, our health sales have declined.  So, as the health sales turn around, the life sales will continue to grow also.", "As far as acquisition, Jimmy, yes, the one we were unsuccessful was primarily in the health business.  We would prefer to have life but the thing about that particular company, their health products were supplemental products that we felt very comfortable with, that had very predictable and stable loss ratios and margins had very good and consistent cash flow.  So, even though it was primarily health, it would have been a good fit for us.", "One of the things we are looking for in a potential acquisition is controlled distribution, which made that attractive.  So, either our captive agency force or something in direct response would be our preference.  But we would consider anything in the life and health field but as long as those products that we are comfortable with.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "We will take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with FPK.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "", "I have got a few questions.  Just to go back to the prior comment, what I am trying to reconcile is, I believe you talked on the last quarter call, about taking some of your producers in the health side, moving them into management positions.  And now we are kind of talking about I guess some retention issues at the branch manager level.  Can you just reconcile those two things?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I can, it is really a combination of the two.  I do not have my last quarter comments in front of me but we did rapidly expand both our Branch Managers, as well as our middle manager levels.  Basically, the people we are promoting were the better producing agents, so that did have a, rather immediate impact on our sales.", "Unfortunately, also, what we have now seen in the fourth quarter is by expanding that rapidly, some of the people we were promoting really were not ready to be promoted and we were not able to make those people successful.  So, we have seen, basically fail in that position and we have got to replace those people and that is going to take us a quarter or two to get those positions filled.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Just moving on the Liberty National margin, margin was higher in the quarter.  Was that kind of an anomaly with fourth quarter, at times have good performance or do you see that sustainable going forward?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "I think that the margin is sustainable going forward.  We did have, trying to look back at the numbers here.  You are comparing it back to the fourth quarter, I would say that margin does fluctuate a little bit during the year and we actually had really quite a bit different seasonal pattern in claims for 2007 than we have had in prior years.", "Actually, I would say that the year-to-date margin for all of 2007 is more what I would look at, in terms of what I think is sustainable going forward.", "Mark Finkelstein - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "", "You re-domesticated some subs, I guess I am curious about the progress or status, in terms of actually merging staff Subs and do you have an estimate on what would be the capital freight up if you were to go this route?", "Mark McAndrew", "You are right; we have re-domesticated some of our subsidiaries to Nebraska.  We saw an immediate savings there in our premium tax rate of $2 to $2.5 million.  We probably will, I think in the next 12 months, merge United American and Liberty National into one entity.  There is significant savings there, but Gary I guess I would have you comment on what you think we might free up as far as capital.", "Gary Coleman", "We will free of some capital.  I do not have a good estimate on that at the moment; I am working on our yearend statutory numbers to do that.  I do not know there is going to be that significant but there will be additional capital.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "We will take our next question with Ed Spehar with Merrill Lynch", "Edward Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "", "Just one quick question, Gary on free cash flow and going forward, I think for a long time now, you have dividending up all of statutory income and I am wondering, is there any, you suggested that this year would be down from last year because you are not going to take a special dividend.  I think that is what you said.  Is there any reason to think that the ration of free cash to stat earnings is changing at all?", "Gary Coleman", "", "No, what I mentioned is that our pre-cash flow for last year was a little higher because we did a $36 million extraordinary dividend that is a one-time item.  Going forward, I think you will continue to see our pre-cash grow and I think that question is whether we can continue to take the earnings of the companies out.", "And the answer is for the perceivable future, I do not see a problem with this, taking all of the earnings as we have done.  We are at a capital level that is more than sufficient now and our earnings are growing at a little bit higher rate than the Campbell requirements are.  You have got to remember, with the type of assets we have and the products we have the capital requirements are less volatile and they grow at pretty consistent pace.  So because of that, I think that our capital will grow sufficiently, even with taking the earnings out as dividends and on top of that I think, for our ratings, we are in an excess capital situation.", "Operator", "We have no further questions. I like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thanks everyone for joining us.  Those are our comments today and we will talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen this will conclude today\u2019s conference.  We thank you for your participation.

Accordingly, please refer to our 2007 10-K which is on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the first quarter was a $132 million or $1.43 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago quarter. Our return on equity was 15.7% and our book value per share excluding FAS 115 was $36.88 up 10% from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 3% or $403 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $108 million. As a percentage of premium life underwriting margins were 27% versus 26% a year ago. Life insurance net sales were $70.5 million up 13% from the first quarter of 2007. On American Income life premiums grew 8.5% to a $115 million; life underwriting margin was up 15% or $37 million.", "Net life sales increased 17% for the quarter to $24 million refer to your collected life premiums grew in 7% to $19 million. The ageing accounted American Income was up 9% from a year ago to 2616.", "Sales at American Income once again exceeded our expectations and sales growth continues to accelerate. As you know, American Income is almost profitable distribution system contributes roughly 30% of our total underwriting income. We\u2019ve remain very optimistic in regards to both our short and long term growth prospectus.", "In our Direct Response operations, life premiums were up 5% to $129 million and life underwriting margin grew 3% or $30 million. Net life sales increased 8% or $31 million and were slightly less than projected. As a result of our first quarter experience we have made some small downward adjustments in our 2008 projections for direct response. We now anticipate high single digit growth in net sales for the year with mid single digit in both premiums and underwriting margins. At Liberty National life premiums decline 3% of $72 million life and life underwriting margin was down 6% to 18 million. ", "Net light sales increased 14% from a year ago to $10 million. The growth in our raise account at Liberty National which was up 62% to 28,140 significantly our paced the growth in sales due to the high concentration of first year agents. Well our new agents believed and doubled in the past year. Our more productive renewal year agents declined by 18%. The good news is that the drop in better in agents stopped in the first quarter and we will see significant improvement in these numbers as the year progresses. We believe that Liberty National is on a right path and continue to expect strong doubled sales growth for the balance of 2008.", "On the health side premium revenue excluding per deed declined 4% of $253 million and help underwriting margin also declined 4% to 45 5 million. Health net sales dropped 29% for the quarter of $42 million. The decline in health sales was almost entirely attributable to the United American Branch Office operation, where health net sales dropped 40%. We continue to see high turnover of our branch office managers as a result of both overly aggressive expansion as well as increased competition. During the last six months, we have lost roughly 1/3 of our branch office managers, which has adversely impacted our new agent recruiting, agent count, and net sales. This high turnover appears to have subsided and we have replaced majority of lost managers.", "New agent recruiting is now increasing and we expect little of any further deterioration. We have loaded our expectations and now anticipate health sales remain adversely the first quarter level for the balance of 2008. I point out that the United American Branch Office contributes only about 7% of our total underwriting income. So our lowered sales estimates had only a minor impact on our 2008 earnings projection. ", "Premium revenue from Medicare part A was down 13% for $47 million and the underwriting margin declined 4% to $4.9 million for the quarter. For the balance of 2008, we expect party underwriting margins remain roughly the same level as they are in the first quarter. ", "Administrative expenses increased 3% for the quarter to $39.8 million. For the four year, we currently project administrative expenses to increase less than 1%. I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman our Chief Financial Officer for his comments on our investment operations.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Thanks Mark, I will spend two minutes discussing investments, excess investment and income and share repurchases. First our investments. Torchmark has $9.5 billion of bonds and amortized cost which comprise 95% of the invested assets. There were bonds 92% of or corporate Bonds in Hybrid Securities. Less than 1% of the bonds are in residential our commercial mortgage back securities and none of those are backed by sub-prime all of they mortgages. Overall the total portfolio is rated A-minus same a year ago. Regarding new investments that we invest almost exclusively investment grade corporate bonds and hybrid securities.", "In the first quarter widening spreads more than offset lower credit rates resulting in higher yields on the investments. We invested $431 million and an average annual effective yield of 7.25% and average rating of A-minus, and average life depending on future calls between 22 to and 35 years. This compares to 6.6 yield averaging [ph] in 2 X 29 year average life of bonds requiring first quarter of last year. The second quarter yield of new investments was the highest yield to the first quarter 2003. And for the second consecutive quarter, the new money yield exceeded the portfolio yield. The average years on the fourth quarter and first quarter was 6.97% 4 basis points lower than the first quarter 2007, but the same thing that is being for the last previous sequential quarters.", "Now turning to excess investment income, it was $83 million, the same as a year ago. However, on the per share basis, excess investment income increased 8%, which reflects the affect of our share repurchase program. Excess investment income in money investment income what else the interest caused for the net net policy liabilities and the financing costs or debt.", "The year-over-year comparison of each of these components is as follows. First, the investment income was at $4 million. However, taking into consideration the municipal bonds acquired later in the first quarter of 2007, investment income on a tax-equivalent basis was up $5 million. This represents a 3% increase of income, slightly lower than a 4% increase in average investment assets.", "Next, the interest cost on the net policy liabilities increased $5 million or 8%, due primarily to 7% increase in the average liabilities. And lastly, financing calls down $1 million due to lower short-term falling [ph] rates.", "Now, regarding our share-repurchase program, in the quarter, we spent $145 million about $2.5 million towards market shares. This is comparable to $167 million used by 3.6 main shares in the first quarter of 2007. The use of pre-cash flow at whole income to pond our stock repurchases. In 2008, we expect free cash flow to be around $55 million. The reason that will be above to sign of last years that in 2007 a free cash flow included pre-cash flow included a $36 million extraordinary dividend from one of our subsidiaries. With our debt at an appropriate level and given the low interest rate environment, we feel that the best use of our pre-cash would be a strategic acquisition. But absent in acquisition, share repurchases will be the best use of our available cash. Those are my comments. I will now turn it back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. For 2008, we are raising our earnings per share projections by $0.02 to a range of $5.90 to $5.96 per share. Which assumes we continue to invest our free-cash flow in our share free cash flow in our share repurchase program.", "Those are my comments. I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question with Tamara Kravec with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "Tamara Kravec \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. Good morning, I was hoping that you can tell them into the Liberty National little bit more you seen very significant agent growth, and you have a concern, a higher concentration of first year agent, so you can talk little bit more about your expectation for those agents to become productive over the courses see the 12 to 18 months? That\u2019s my first question and then I have follow-up.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Certainly, I don\u2019t have the number in front of me but my recollection is that we knew your agent\u2019s Liberty National will produce on average roughly. I believe it some one 30% more production for agent then a first year agent. And may be slightly higher then that, but again if you look at the trends that Liberty National on agent counts. A year ago we had 720 renewal agents were down to 588. But if you look at the growth in first year, they have really began, we really started to see significant growth in the second quarter of 2007, when it jumped from 1037 to 1273, and we saw big jumps in the third, fourth and first quarter of this year. Those newly higher at age 12 months later will flow into the renew your agent count. So I do expect were the first year agents of the last 12 months had doubled I expect to see over the next twelve months substantial improve in our new your agent count, I would be surprised that we didn\u2019t see our new year agent increase by at least 50% over the next 12 months. So when we, if it continue to see growth in a first year agents then we, we can also if we can see 50% growth in our new your agents I think the prospects were sales growth that Liberty National our excellent.", "Tamara Kravec \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thank you. And my second question is on the United branch office operation you talk briefly about the high turned over in your branch office managers and I\u2019m guessing you are seeing you know still increase competition that if you could elaborate more on you know essentially is the problem were compensation is that, is that you know just growth opportunities on and then how fast you, you have replaced managers set on you are expecting age or where continuing to increase that how quickly do you think it can, you can get back to the level by you, that you were before the environment [inaudible]?.", "Mark McAndrew", "That was a very good question. I wish I knew exactly, but it is United American and the health insurance market place it is the most competitive market that we see in any _ distribution system, over last 25 years we seen numerous occasion, were we have big peaks and values in our sales as result the competition and what we have seen we introduce product roughly 3 years ago what we saw very nice increase is in our sale and agent growth and now we are seeing competitor copy the product copying the under writing and really target our Asian C-force. If not so much compensation it\u2019s we have competitors that offer may be wider ranges products and we, then we currently offer but they have seen some success reputing way some our people, we have replace most of those losses and we have to build to back but I really \u2013 I am going to be cautious about making any projections about when we see a go back to the level it was. Well, right now we have lowered our assumptions for the balance of this year to be roughly the same as the first quarter level. We hope to beat that but it\u2019s really difficult to say how quickly that will turn around.", "Tamara Kravec \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Okay and just lastly, quickly on your investment portfolio, you are moving further out and in terms of the maturity of the investments you are acquiring. Is that a strategy you expect to maintain, is it really just now given the wider spread and what you are seeing out in the market place, you know, any commentary about your strategy in light of market conditions would be very helpful?", "Mark McAndrew", "This is the perfect time to be going on over the one spreads as well as they are, but we have been going on and at some point at the spreads time and again we\u2019ll go back to what we have done in the past. We targeted the yell about 6.5%. It\u2019s always been getting quality bonds yelling that amount, we are going to go long, we can do that because of the type of cash flow we have  but in the past years where we couldn\u2019t get a 6.5%, we would go shorter but right now, again this is perfect time to go along. Some of the quarters, I mentioned earlier that\u2019s the highest we invested since early 2003 and that we are going to continue to invest long and to get those higher yeild.", "Tamara Kravec \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our next question with Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you and good morning. First on direct response, you have breakdown of South Coast in a direct response between insert media and remote additional channels. Also, Pat if you can discuss the \u2013 with the insert media initiatives that you are in thought of results that you expected and then I expect a couple of quick follow ups as well?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Okay, well I do, Nigel, and we are probably not going to provide quiet as much details we have in the past and some of our direct response. We did as a result of the acquisition last year, but much of that is somewhat confidential, but I\u2019ll do as far as for the quarter. If I look at our insert media just net sales, the about sales in the insert media, which comprise all between 20 to 25% of our total sales were up 23% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. ", "If I look at the juvenile sales coming from insert media, they were down 10% for the quarter; part of the reason for that is dollar sales had a one-month introductory offer where as the juvenile has the three month, so the significant increases in circulation that we saw in the second, particularly in the fourth quarter really had on flow through the juvenile sales yet where they are flowing through the adult. But, again direct response sales were a little bit less than what I had forecast. I would have expected it somewhere close for the 12% growth for the quarter and they were in the lower 8%. So, I am not \u2013 it\u2019s not a significant difference but they were a little bit less than what I projected.", "Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay and then next on capital, you wished that capital ratio at year end was terribly low. Can you discuss your plans to move it back towards your target range, I think it\u2019s over 300% with the writing agencies are still comfortable with your repurchasing so you think averaging ratio come from?", "", "Mark McAndrew", "Nigel, we slipped to below 300% on a consolidated basis this year to do the several one time unusual items for example we were at extra ordinary debtors that I mentioned earlier we also adopted a [inaudible] plan and we had settlement of prior year taxes all of which had a negative impact on surplus in 2007 and also our required GAAP was a still hardly expected to do the really some changes in rules in the placement of our certain our assets with our company, we just been like a job in participating the impact of those or we could have taken steps to keep that at above the 300% level we will go impact those steps now in the, in these low cost steps we will increase our stationery surplus we can do that through our increased to the company re insurance of a premium efficiency reserves we can monetize in more right as bounces there were additional before the tax credits that we can recognize all those things will improve our surplus in on the campus side we can  reduce our campus charges about personal re emerging and where companies and in sight we just where we place the assets but we expect certainly before the end of the year that will be back up in the 302 to 330 range that we had been into the over the last five or six years in it. We can take these steps pretty quickly and also all these lines are reduced in and more heavily impact on our pre cash flows.", "Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay and then the as the last question I had was on Industrial income in the positive benefited from interested rates swaps you close that you know the flat yield to now we since in stepping as you could I say some thing you are looking to you put by back on place?", "Mark McAndrew", "You know where we that\u2019s one we need to look it again because that was very beneficial back few years [inaudible] that was we, we have doing thing we have a view we will take a look at it.", "Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Again is that incorporated in your guidance as yet to with that be with a potential positive?", "Mark McAndrew", "There will be a positive we do not count with that again it.", "Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks a lot, thanks a lot?", "Operator", "Now we will take our next question with Robert Galsspiegel with Langen McAlenney. Please go ahead sir.", "Robert Galsspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Good morning and pretty close I guess as the, the then of [inaudible] I just wanted pass on thanks for Joyce on the great job she started investor relations in worker and I will wish her well in the future Mark as way we could go into watch behind the increase in earnings got its should be best investments income had a couple of minus negative doctors and sales in premiums but it\u2019s the best one income that when in offsetting this?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yeah Bob it is the increase is strictly on a higher yield on our new investments then what we had anticipated and it\u2019s an investment again.", "Robert Galsspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "And I just want to follow up, just a tremendous question here giving the yields to higher why would be keep on down a bit, on the quality may be it\u2019s the that was says out there that are long and going longer see to sort of by the time that you don\u2019t need to make numbers stretch on duration in yield your credit analysis say these are right opportunities or this had been more significant drive in this that call?", "Mark McAndrew", "No Bob it is the further analysis we say we\u2019re dipping down already but we have been a month over the last several quarters but again we know we will obviously pay attention to the right. We do our own credit research and we feel like we are getting good credits otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be buy them we are not settled down and credit it was just to get more yield. Again we are benefiting by the water spreads but we are not setting down a quality.", "Robert Galsspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay, just reading through the annual report and your commentary on the last call, it just seems like you have upgraded your acquisitions in your thought process and you mentioned you won the silver medal on the last quarter. Is anything live that we should be thinking about or just give us a little bit of hope what would be motion trigging to you?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well Bob obliviously we are continuing to look and that\u2019s about all I can comment on their other than you know again what we are looking for, we are looking for companies that have predictable stable earnings.  We definitely like to see some type of capital distribution whether it is an agency force or direct response.  We accompany that has high expenses, also something we believe we can add significant value to you, so those are some of the biggest factors we are looking at and there is number of companies out there but I cant really talk anymore specific about anything other than that Bob.", "Robert Galsspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Pan America [ph] financial services is the ventures that came in the market and its more towards [inaudible] in capital distribution and relatively predictable earnings.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Well if it had the predictable earnings of capital distribution then it would be something we would take a look at.", "Robert Galsspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Ok thank you very much.", "Gary L. Coleman", "", "Sure Bob.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question with Edward Spehar with Merrill Lynch please go ahead.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, good morning, a couple of questions, first Gary I just want to know if you could you help us in terms of the portfolio yield trend, given the cash that you see coming in over the next year, if reinvestment rate state where they are.  Do you have any sense how the portfolio yield would progress upward and then on the underwriting side, I was wondering if you could expand Mark a little bit on competitive issue that you talk about in health.  Are you seeing is this insurance company, mutual, or they are healthcare companies.  Who is the sort of source of this competitive pressure and is there anything to be optimistic in terms of Medicare supplement, any changes that you seeing come in terms of reimbursement that might make that business a little bit better at, some point? Thanks.", "", "Mark McAndrew", "Alright, Gary you want to take the first.", "Gary Coleman", "Sure.", "Ed, if we invested the 7% for the remainder year, year for now, our portfolio year will still be around 697 just under 7%, they would help to add additional little bit extra yield there but also we got bonds coming off at little bit higher yields but again the 7% we should be at least at the 697 over our day might be slight higher.", "Alright, add-on the health competition I don\u2019t really want to names but there are the company too out there that is Health Insurance Companies that basically have seen products we have been offering and/or underwriting in it, basically duplicated the products and these are the companies that are already in the major medical market place, but they are underwriting on major medical is very strict.  The products we have offered with more limited benefit had a little more lenient underwriting and we also lower priced, which was kind about our niche and they have taken basically our products and copied our underwriting and that really gone after entire our agents. We will over come up and we will rebuild and move forward. We are also looking at other products and other markets that we might be able to move into there. As far as Medicare supplement I don\u2019t see any short-term significant changes there.  I know the reimbursement rate for the Medicare advantage plans are not keeping up with inflation so those margins will be squeezed but it will be interesting to follow the election this year if there should be a democratic president, as well as the democratic congress.  I would think there is a much bigger chance to see many those Medicare advantage plans really squeeze much further and that I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if certain things significant [inaudible] should that happen but it is really kind on that.  ", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Ok if I could just follow up with Gary if the numeral yield was 7. I think it was 7.2% in the quarters, is that correct?", "Gary Coleman", "Within quarter yeah.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Ok if it is 71/4 quarter going forward rather than 7, how much does that change the mass on the overall portfolio?", "Gary Coleman", "I think that moves up to 7.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Ok, thank you. Do you have an estimate on the staff benefit of merging the sub at this stage.", "Gary Coleman", "Well we know we can do it in stages and I known merging a couple of companies as fare as required capital will save us somewhat between $5 million and $10 million of capital which was significant. I don\u2019t have [inaudible] overall. We re-domesticated our companies ", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Okay. And then just a, at UA branch on, on the last call you talked about some I guess some ill advised promotions to branch managers etcetera. I guess with filling those positions now I likely feeling them I guess what gives you confidence that the replacements you know are the right ones and on you know some of thus made mistake or made last quarter. You not repeat them selves.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, there is always someone certainty, but where we are holding, we are enforcing higher standard for promotion, we still have at about 150 branch office, we still have I believe 18 openings right now, so we are not just putting [inaudible] and there we part of our problem was we got relaxed on our promotion standards both quality business and recruiting in and we gone back and we\u2019re enforcing those standards and we are not promoting people that do not meet those standard any more so we still have replace all of, a losses we still do have I think right now about 18 openings, but a we do expect to fill those during this quarter. ", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Okay. And then, if you mentioned in the, you know your opening remarks I apologies but can you what are the growth sales trends at direct responds?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. As far as growth, so those are policies that have been issued but haven\u2019t paid first [inaudible] well just hold on you second I am going to those your actually for the second quarter. Total growth sales and direct responds were up 28%, now I don\u2019t we because of the mix of the business and certain media trends to have a lower, first will be call first exposure process and submitting well over have a lower percentage of policies paying first fall premium versus the direct mail so I don\u2019t expect to see that 28% growth and net sales next quarter it will be something listen that but it should still be, we still expect to see double digit growth at least for the next quarter.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "", "Okay. Great, thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We take our next question with Jamminder Bhullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead", "Jamminder Bhullar \u2013  J.P. Morgan", "Cole I thank you. I just have a couple of question the first one is on I think Mark you mentioned that you expect United American sales of brand sales to be stable from here, what gives you the confidence that\u2019s going to happen to be loss of lot of Asian. May be you could give us some numbers on what\u2019s happen in the Asian count since the end of the first quarter and then secondly on American Income you have seen nice improvement in sales last few quarters what really driven that if you can discuss your outlook for that channel and also adjust an update on the new SGAs that you are adding to existing territory there what going on of that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Jimmy let see its branch our office and I have got some numbers here in front of me. We have seen the decline, well we seen the turn over the branch managers first slow down and we got few openings then we had two months ago, where we did have close to thirty openings now we have we are down to 18 over result we seen our new agent recruiting was up particularly in the lot of part of first quarter was up about 10% from year ago. So we seen the Asian can\u2019t stabilize and plus there was such an effort to recruit our people way I think most of the managers who where going to leave have left. And again, find the numbers for the last three weeks since end of the quarter but the number have stabilize out and American Income there is, there is number of thing contributing to its growth and sales. if recall I believe it was beginning in the third quarter last year, we did make some changes in our compensation and our bonus compensation at America income, and is really pretty simple with _ paying months like bonuses to paying bonuses on a weakly basis, and they were design to not only give more money to the Asian _ but it was design to reward consistent production. They earn the bonus, if I hit the bonus level of first week I get certain amount it builds up if they hit at again the second, and third week, if they miss week at it the bonus level goes back down. So that has encourage much more consistent production of the Asians, so we have seen a, an increase in our production for Asians, we made the change or similar change Liberty National beginning in the fourth quarter and we saw nice increase and sales Liberty National. But we also are moving forward with adding SGA and describe before centralizing our lead generation function. It still slow or then I would like to see at, we are still only about a quarter of the total territories were we consolidated the public relation function. Part of that reason would generating net American Income roughly 100 thousands leads of month.  And up until now the tracking and distribution roughly is been pretty much a manual process, what were developing systems to how to make that and what we the expect to have those system in place by June. Once those systems during place it that process will speed up significantly, because that right now that is, that is the one portion of that holdings its back.", "Jamminder Bhullar \u2013  J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And just to follow up, you some one you done this before on acquisition but I think there is an acquisition last year that you lost out on the you, still have an interest and doing deals with environment like at is it a reasonable chance that you will find something that\u2019s suitable this year, or do you just expect spending the money on buyback.", "Mark McAndrew", "Do I , I wish I had a crystal [inaudible] Jimmy. You know are there properties that are out there because of what\u2019s going on the economy and better available now at attractive prices are just looking for a while or so.", "Jamminder Bullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Well, I really think, we [inaudible] been looking seriously now for may be nine months and they are companies out there, [inaudible] of investors where not necessarily for sales. It\u2019s just impossible to say. ", "", "There is nothing imminent but there are some companies out there we would definitely have an interest in we think it\u2019s a good time to make one. But I really just can even predict when they will happen there could be something come up in the next three months, it would take two years to find something.", "Jamminder Bullar \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we have no further questions. I like to turn it back over to management for additional or closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay.

In our life insurance operations premium revenue grew by 4% to $406.5 million and our life underwriting margin increased 3% to $104 million. Life insurance net sales were $76 million, up 13% from the second quarter of 2007. ", "At American Income, life premiums grew 9% to $119 million. Life underwriting margin was up 11% to $38 million. Life net sales increased 21% to $28 million with first year collected life premiums growing 11% to $21 million. The agent count at American Income was up 17% from a year ago to 2,805. Sales growth at American Income continued to accelerate in the second quarter as a result of increased recruiting and improved retention of new agents. The results at American Income are pleasing  so we and remain very optimistic in regards to both our short and long-term growth prospects. ", "In our direct response operation, life premiums were up 7% to $129 million, and life underwriting margin grew 2% to $30 million. Life net sales again increased 8% to $32 million and were in line with our expectations. We expect to continue to see sales growth in the 5% to 10% range for the balance of this year. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $72 million and life underwriting margin was also down 3% to $16 million. Life net sales jumped 34% from a year ago to $12 million. Our producing agents grew to 3189, up 64% in the past year. ", "The sales growth at Liberty National is significantly exceeding my expectations. The bonus compensation programs we have put in place are working well, and a new need based laptop sales presentation has been very well received by both our agents as well as our customers. We believe we will continue to see sales growth at Liberty National in excess of 30% for the second half of this year. On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $242 million and health underwriting margin declined 5% to $44 million. Health net sales dropped 41% to $38 million. The decline in health sales was again primarily attributable to the United American Branch Office operation, where health net sales were down 53%. ", "On the last call, I expressed an expectation that our agent count would flatten during the second quarter, but I was wrong and the decline continued. The health insurance market United American is the only market we serve that is highly competitive. As a result of this competition we have seen huge swings in our sales results for more than 20 years. The non-Medicare health business at United American is also the least persistent, highest risk and least profitable business we write. ", "Going forward, we are going to focus our efforts on shifting this distribution system to other product lines ar more persistent , less risky and yield higher profit margins. We have introduced Liberty National life and work site supplemental health products to the Branch Office operation. While we will continue to offer our current product portfolio, in fact we are filing a new under age 65 health product this quarter. ", "The majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage sales of the Liberty National product line. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was down 19% for the quarter to $44.5 million. Underwriting margin declined 9% to $5.4 million. Due to a renegotiated contract with our Pharmacy Benefits Manager, we expect underwriting margins on this block of business to increase roughly $1 million per quarter for the balance of this year. Administrative expenses increased 3% for the quarter to $38 million, primarily the result of increased pension expense. We continue to expect an increase in administrative expenses for full year 2008 of roughly 1%. ", "Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer gives his comments on our investment operations.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing investments, excess investment income and share repurchases. First on our investments, we have $9.5 million of bonds and amortized costs which comprise 95% of invested assets. Of those bonds, 92% are corporate bonds and hybrid securities. Less than 1% are in residential or commercial mortgage-backed securities and none of those are backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages. The low investment grade bonds as a percentage of invested asset declined to 6.2%, the lowest percentage since the second quarter of 2000. Overall the portfolio is rated A-minus, same as a year ago. ", "Regarding new investments, we invest almost exclusively in investment grade corporate bond and hybrid securities. In the second quarter, we invested $241 million at an average annual effective yield of 7.04%, an average rating of a plus, and an average life depending on future costs of between 23 and 32 years. This compares to the 6.77% yield, A-rating in 20 to 33 year average life of bonds acquired in the second quarter of last year. This is the third consecutive quarter that the new money yield exceeded 7% and also exceeded the portfolio yield. The average yield on the portfolio in the second quarter was 6.98%, two basis points higher than the second quarter of 2007 and virtually the same as it has been for the last four sequential quarters. ", "To turn to excess investment income. It was $84 million, up 5% or $4 million. However, on a per share basis, excess investment income increased 12% which reflects the effect of our share repurchase program. Excess investment income of course is the net investment income less the interest cost on the net policy liabilities and the financing costs for our debt. The year-over-year comparison of each component is as follows. First, net investment income was up $7 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in income just slightly lower than the 4.8% increase in average invested assets. Next, the interest cost of the net policies increased $5 million or 8% due primarily to a 7% increase in the average liabilities. ", "Lastly, the financing costs were down $2 million, due to the lower short-term borrowing amount and also lower interest rates. Regarding our share repurchase program in the quarter, we spent $89 million to buy $1.5 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we've used $235 million to buy just fewer than four million shares. This is comparable to the $298 million used to buy 4.5 million shares in the first half of 2007. We used free cash flow at the holding company to fund our stock repurchases. In 2008, we expect net free cash flow to be around $350 million. With our debt at an appropriate level and again given the lower interest rate environment we feel that the best use of our free cash would be a strategic acquisition. Without the acquisition, then share repurchases will be the best use of our available cash. ", "", "Mark McAndrew", "", "For the second quarter, we missed the consensus estimate of our earnings per share by $0.03 and we missed our own estimates by about $0.015 cents due to higher than expected life claims paid during the quarter. We expect these claims to return to more normalized levels for the balance of the year. Additional money is being contributed by the new Part D Pharmacy Benefits Manager contract; we continue to expect our full year earnings per share to be in the range we stated last quarter. ", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "Thank you. For those of us who will be joined by the telephone today, today's question-and-answer-session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just have a couple of questions. The first one is on your outlook for producing agent growth at American Income and Liberty National. I think sequentially you were up almost 10% in those channels. What sort of growth rate do you expect in that going forward? ", "Then secondly on M&A, you've talked about wanting to do a deal for a while, haven't found anything. Do you see any opportunities in the market, whether it's distressed sales or just company selling non-core businesses?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Jimmy, I'm very encouraged by both American Income and Liberty National. Again, we had over 20% growth in sales at American Income for the quarter. I think with the compensation programs we have in place and the direction we're heading, I expect to see at least the balance this year and into next year, I think we've got some other things, some other plans that will continue to allow that type of growth to continue. ", "Liberty National, I think is going to surprise people. They had 34% growth this quarter. Although it's just gotten us back to where we were before we made the major changes two years ago. The momentum we have there is extremely good. Again, this new software we put together for the new laptop presentation, it's improved our closing rates. It\u2019s really been received well. When I say I expect 30% or more growth there the second half of this year, I think that's on the conservative side. I think we can continue that type of growth. I think over the next year, Liberty National is going to surprise people. On the M&A activity, Jimmy, I really can't comment about any specific activity. We continue to think there are opportunities out there. But I can't really comment beyond that.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Just one follow-up on the health side. Do you see a turnaround anytime soon, either the agent count our just you returning to flat sales or sales growth at least over the next two to three quarters or not?", "Mark McAndrew", "We expect them to level out again. But right now, our projections. We're still in the branch office. We're still expecting about another additional 10% off of where we were this quarter. It started to come back in the fourth. But again, we really are going to use this opportunity to try to shift that into another marketplace. Again, the volatility of those sales, it is extremely competitive, highly regulated and it is the least profitable business we have. It is a good opportunity for us to really make an effort to shift that production into more persistent profitable business.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ed Spehar with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ed Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. Had a couple of questions. First, Mark, on the sales strength in the life business, when do you think about the health business being less persistent and the sales being down much more than what you were thinking, is the strength, the better than expected life sales in your eyes enough to offset sort of the weakness in the health that we're thinking about kind of earnings over the next, beyond this year just generally?", "Mark McAndrew", "I'm glad you asked that, Ed because actually in fact, if you can try to follow these numbers, I want to go through a little example. If we compare the American Income life insurance to the Branch Office health. If you look at our financials, the life business at American Income has a 32% underwriting margin versus 13% in the Branch Health. Now if we just assume 6% administrative expenses, that says we have 26% underwriting profit at American Income on their life business versus 7% in the underage health business. That means that for every dollar of premium we collect, the American Income business is almost four times as profitable. But beyond that, the average life of the business at American Income is more than double what it is in the United American underage health sales. So for every dollar of new sales at American Income is worth almost, actually over $8 worth of health sales in the Branch office. ", "So the additional $5 million of sales we picked up at American Income would be roughly equivalent to $40 million of underage health sales in the branch office, so will offset? Yes, in fact, if I look at the additional $5 million we picked up there, plus Liberty National's life business is about five times as profitable per dollar of new sales. So the additional $3 million of sales we picked up there, more than offsets, in fact, it would offset if all of our health sales at United American disappeared. The growth in sales we're seeing at American Income and Liberty National would offset all of the lost profitability. You follow that?", "Ed Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. That's extremely helpful. I guess the second thing I wanted to ask is on the unusual number of claims in a few different distribution channels I think a few pennies off of a consensus number for our financial services company is probably not considered a big deal in most instances these days. But when you look at your company and the stability of earnings, this was a bigger miss than what you would normally see. So I'm wondering if you can give additional color on why we should be comfortable that this is just an aberration, a bad mortality quarter, and maybe give us some color on, where the claims are coming from. Is it old books versus new books, is there any different types of products versus what you historically sold? Anything, would be help on that. ", "Mark McAndrew", "I'll turn it over to Rosemary in a minute. Although I would say, Ed yes, we did miss consensus by $0.03. But, if I compare to where our estimates that we used in our guidance, we were about 1.5 cents less. But I will let Rosemary talk more about the claims. Rosemary?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Okay. We did have higher claims than expected and it was actually in three different lines. I would say that the reasons are actually different for those three lines. As far as direct response is concerned, in terms of the analysis that we've been able to do so far, we really have not seen any kind of a trend emerging that would cause us to think that our underlying mortality assumptions are off, and so we really do not anticipate that the level going forward for underwriting income would be about what it was in the first quarter of this year. ", "As far as the next line would be Liberty National, where we had higher claims than anticipated, and we've always had variance among the quarters in terms of what our underwriting income our profits are for that line. Last year we saw more of the variance than what we had been used to seeing. We really hadn't anticipated that would actually continue for 2008. But, what we're seeing now for 2008 really is pretty close to the pattern that we saw in 2007 for Liberty National. ", "So we're actually anticipating that the remainder of 2008 is going to really mimic more of 2007 and so that the underwriting income will actually come up in the second two quarters there.", "Mark McAndrew", "Rosemary, I also know, the July paid claims of Liberty National have come back in line with September. ", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "Yeah. Actually I was going to mention that, too. Actually in all of the lines the July claims based on what we have so far, really are looking better, as they are lower than what they had been before. ", "The third line where we had higher claims and what we were anticipating is in the other category. That actually is coming from United Investors. United investors have a much higher average size. So, it really doesn't take much of a fluctuation in the number of claims for the dollars to fluctuate. ", "But it you look at that line and you compare the first six months of 2008 to the first six months of 2007, we're actually in about the same place even though the individual quarters have fluctuated more. So, we're anticipating really that we're going to finish the year in that other category as consistent with what we saw in 2007.", "Ed Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "", "Just Rosemary, back on the Liberty National, I understand that the 2Q was elevated last year as well. But is there something going that suggests that this is going to be an annual event or what makes you comfortable that there isn't something else happening in the mortality in Liberty National?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "Well, as I said really, in terms of the analysis we've done so far, we just really haven't seen any trends emerge. There is no one product that's really emerging that looks like it's a problem. And Liberty National has always had variation among the quarters.", "Ed Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "", "In fact, for the last several years we've seen prior paid claims in the first half of the year, than we have in the second half.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Right. There is just a little bit more pronounced than what it had been. But it really is tracking with what 2007 did.", "Ed Spehar - Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Good morning everyone. You guys are not the type of company that goes and hires Mackenzie consultants and does strategic reviews and announces like major changes in strategy which I sort of find refreshing actually compared to most of the other companies that we follow. ", "But Mark, I'm just trying to see whether your comment on switching to health emphasis to lets say from individual, is major long-term change or just a time-out pause? We can't make much money in health because the metrics, margins and persistency on life versus health are not new numbers. Those are numbers that have been around for as long as I've been involved in the company. But it sounds like you guys have made a pretty significant change in strategy that may be more than just a one-quarter response to market competition.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I would agree with that, Bob. Is it a quick fix? No. It will take sometime to do it actually. One of the things is we're very encouraged with the model we put together at Liberty International, the compensation, the products, the sales presentation. We're seeing extremely good results there. ", "So much of our sales come from new agents. All of our distributions, roughly half of our sales come from really agents in our first six months. So by focusing even just on our new hires and training them and using this sales presentation, these products, we can see over the next year to two years a significant movement. ", "Why haven't we done it before now? One, when sales are growing by 50%, it's kind of hard to rock the boat too much. Aso, if I look back a year ago, two years ago, our life distribution systems were not performing, at least to my satisfaction. It is a good opportunity to do this. We've battled that health market; we're not going to abandon it, but it has just seen huge fluctuations over the last 20 years. It is highly competitive, and it is highly regulated. ", "So, I just think now is the time to do it. The thought was, over the next year we were going to merge the two entities, and we still have plans to do that. It's a good time for the United American agents to begin getting comfortable with Liberty National products. Although we will continue to allow them to offer the products they currently have.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Do you have any other products that you don't manufacture in this work site to broaden it out or do you think you have the full arsenal of products?", "Mark McAndrew", "At Liberty National we offer a couple of outside products. But the vast majority of the sales come from products we have, that we manufacture.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Last question, just on the acquisition front, it was a quarter or two ago that you said you might do a deal that would take you out of share repurchase for a year or two but you charged ahead at a little slower than last year's pace. Is there a read that that's a big acquisition that would take you on a cash flow needs for buyback? Did you think it might have been there ", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, Bob, again, I can't comment on our acquisition activity. We're being more selective this year. Last year, we did heavily weight our stock repurchase in the first half of the year. With the volatility we're seeing in the market and in our stock price, we're being a little more selective at what price we're buying it at. So, we're spreading it out a little more and we're not going to stop our share repurchase unless we do find a good acquisition. So we're continuing to repurchase shares.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "", "Thank you very much, Mark.", "Operator", "Then our next question is from Stephen Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "I just wanted to follow up on what Bob asked in the restructuring of branch. Mark, put this in the right way, you're going to be increasing the incentives on the life side. Is that correct? You are trying to get these guys over to the LNL products?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, we are already at Liberty National.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "I am talking about actually the Liberty National Product. ", "Mark McAndrew", "I'm just saying, at liberty national we have put together some very strong bonus incentives there which is part of the reason we're seeing the growth that we're seeing at Liberty National. We will put those same incentives in for the United American agents, which the opportunity for them to make a very good living, selling life insurance, is definitely there. The compensation per sale, we feel good about. So, we are going to continue to really try to direct those sales in that direction.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "", "Okay, let me ask you this. Because I would imagine an independent sales guy who specializes in health wants to continue specialize in health, he would just take his business elsewhere. These are obviously branch agents. Is there something in the branch, some kind of deal or something like that, if they're not happy with the way things are going that would still keep them with you?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, the veteran agents that we have, we're not taking products away from them. In fact, as I mentioned we're actually filing a new health product this quarter that we'll probably have out in the fourth quarter. We're not trying to run those people off and don't intend to. We will continue to provide them with products to write. But for newly hired agents, we're sure going to try to move them into writing the Liberty National product line.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "Sure", "Mark McAndrew", "Again within six months, a substantial portion of our sales come from agents that have been recruited in the past six months.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "That's true. Is there going to be any changes on the under 65 health side in commissions?", "Mark McAndrew", "I don't think there is. We are looking at that, but we haven't, there's no definitive decision being made there.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Burke with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. With respect to the incentives that you mentioned Mark, to encourage new agents hired at United American to sell Liberty products, are you talking about Liberty life products or health products?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, both. We're putting out basically the Liberty National portfolio to them. Again, we're trying to encourage both individual life sales as well as worksite sales. About 40% of Liberal National sales are worksite, both supplemental health as well as life and so all of the entire product line is being introduced. But again, the need-based sales presentation that Andy King has put together for the Liberty National agents has made the training and actually the closing rates that we're seeing at Liberty National are far superior to what we've seen in the past and we think it's going to be much easier to recruit and train and make agents successful in the United American Branch Office as a result of that sales tool also.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "Do you think that the health insurance business can, I'm still trying to get a sense of the outlook for the health business at United American and in particular, with the making of available to the United American agents of Liberty Health products, do you think that will make a difference?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, yes, I hope it makes a difference, but I don't know that the United American health sales are just, we have roughly $20 million of health sales at United American this quarter. Our expectation right now are that it is going to drop to about $18 million next quarter, then be back up in the $20 million range in the fourth quarter. So we don't see much additional drop off, but we hope to add to that with writing a substantial amount of the Liberty National product.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Eric, I've got an additional comment. I think really what we're trying to do is also improve the persistency because of that.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "Absolutely.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Really is going to make a huge difference and if we can structure the agent compensation so that it is dependent on that good persistency, I think that's really what will make a big difference with that.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "That is part of the incentive compensation.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Right.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "Okay the other question, the final question I had relates to the mortality issues that were referenced in earlier questions and by you, Mark. When I look at your financials here, you call it your financial supplement and I look at the underwriting results. It\u2019s not apparent to me that there was adverse mortality in the sense that if you look at, for example, at Liberty and at the direct response operation and you just look at the set, a ratio of net policy obligations to premiums, which is all shown in page 8 of your financials. It doesn't look like there was really much of a change indeed for the entire life business. The underwriting margin was essentially the same this year as last. So if the disappointment was related to adverse mortality, why don't we see it in these numbers?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "I think what we were saying is that for one thing, the deviation or the difference from what we expected wasn't a large dollar amount. But we compare our numbers pretty closely. If we have any deviation at all we're going to look at it to see what the differences really are.", "Mark McAndrew", "Also, you know, in comparison to what Rosemary said earlier. Second quarter of last year at Liberty National, we had the highest paid claim in a quarter that we've had in three years, so we are comparing to a quarter last year that had very high claims. What Rosemary has said was we were not anticipating that same pattern this year. We were expecting more of a level pattern. But we have seen again higher claims in the second quarter than what we anticipated. The actual paid claims in the second quarter this year were less at Liberty National than they were the second quarter of last year. But they were still higher than what we had projected.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Finklestein with FPK. Please go ahead.", "Mark Finklestein - FPK", "Hi, just a couple more quick questions on the health restructuring. I guess just hearing you and talking about the merging of the stack companies and kind of getting a little bit closer to LNL, is the end game to essentially merge these distributions, so we do not see a separate LNL in UA branch distribution?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes. I think that is where we end up really within the next year. That's the United American offices will become Liberty offices, and they will basically offer the same product portfolio with the same compensation systems.", "Mark Finklestein - FPK", "Okay.Then, the only other question I was going to ask you is, are they largely in the same markets and is there any risks of channel conflicts and maybe any concerns on the L&L side about this transition?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Very little. Again, Liberty National is so concentrated in the South-East, particularly Alabama, where we have no branch office, United American doesn't have a branch office in Alabama.", "Mark Finklestein - FPK", "", "Right.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "The United American branch offices are spread out over 36 states, and there's very little conflict there. I don't think that's a problem.", "Mark Finklestein - FPK", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Schuman with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Good morning. You talked a fair bit about the under age 65 health strategy. I was wondering if you can just give us an update on how you're thinking about the Part D business. It has turned out to be a profitable business certainly. But, at this point the premiums are declining. ", "Is the plan from here just to manage that for whatever growth you can get, or is there some strategic rethink you can do to maybe actually turn that into a growth vehicle?", "Mark McAndrew ", "It's such a small part of our business and, I think the first option is where we're at. We will manage it and we will try to maximize our profits on that. But I don\u2019t want to expend a lot of effort and I don\u2019t see potential to try to really focus our efforts on growing that business.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "", "Is this a franchise that might have some value to another party or not?", "Mark McAndrew ", "", "Oh, possibly. But just like most of our businesses, we've never been able to find people that will pay us what we believe its worth. So, it might have some value, but I don't know if it would have more value than what it has to us.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow up from Stephen Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James ", "Thanks. To follow up on Part D, I'm just wondering, Mark. With the PBM fees change, I think your margin is going to get north of 15%. Do you think that's sustainable in \u201809?", "Mark McAndrew ", "Rosemary, you want to comment on that?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "Mark. If you don't mind, I think I can answer that question. ", "Mark McAndrew ", "Alright.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "We expect to see, about 15.5% margin for the remainder of this year. But we expect 2009, that's going to go back to \u201811.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James ", "", "Back to \u201811. Okay.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "Yes.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James ", "", "Glad I asked. Rosemary, going back a little bit to the adverse mortality a tiny bit that you have, I'm just wondering about the timing of it. Maybe there was a lag in reporting from the first part. The entire industry had poor mortality pretty much, in the first quarter. You guys did not, and then suddenly you see it a little bit. So, I'm just wondering if maybe, what we're seeing here is a lag from what the industry saw in the first quarter.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "", "I think that there were some, lags in our reporting and how we viewed it, and so it's probably true that some of the claims that we're dealing with being paid now might have actually been incurred in 2007. That's just always a real hard number to try to guess or not to guess sorry, that's a bad word, but to try to estimate. But, yeah, I think we did see some changes in our lag patterns that impacted that number.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James ", "", "From 2007 or from first quarter \u201808?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Well, I\u2019ll put more of it in \u201807 I think.", "Stephen Schwartz - Raymond James ", "", "Well, okay. All right. That's interesting. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Eric Burke from Lehman Brothers. Go ahead.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers ", "Thanks. It seems like the independent side of United American health business is enjoying a level of production that, while not increasing, is not deteriorating to nearly the same degree that your branch office is. Why is that?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "I don't know if I have an answer for you on that, Eric.", "Gary Coleman", "Must be a good question then, right?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "It is a good question. We have a core group of long-term, independent agents that have continued to produce for us over the years some Medicare business that we write. Again, we're still out recruiting new, independent agents. But it just hasn't been impacted as much by the competition. Again, because there have been companies out there specifically going after our branch office managers, agents, and recruiting them away from us.", "Eric Burke - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. McAndrew.", "Mark McAndrew ", "All right.

Please note that this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast. At this time I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel, Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of my comments or answers to your questions this morning may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2007 10-K which is on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the third quarter was $132 million or $1.51 per share, per share increase of 9% from a year ago quarter. Net income was $0.72 per share as a result of an $0.80 per share charge for impairments in our bond portfolio. Excluding FAS 115 our return on equity was 15.7% for the quarter and our book value per share was $37.99, up 8% from a year ago.", "On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value is $27.95 per share. At that book value our return on equity would be roughly 21%.", "In our life insurance operations premium revenue grew 3% to $406 million. And life underwriting margins increased 2% to $108 million. Life insurance net sales were $75 million for the quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2007.", "At American Income life premiums grew 8.5% to $121 million and life underwriting margins was up 12% to $40 million. Net life sales increased 15% to $28 million with first year collected life premiums also growing 15% to $21 million. The ageing accounted American Income was up 10% from a year ago to $2887 [ph].", "I continue to be pleased with the results of American Income and expect double-digit growth in sales to continue in 2009. We have begun work on a new need based computer sales presentation which we hope to introduce the first half of next year similar to something we are doing at Liberty National. When implemented we believe this presentation will increase our average sales size, improve our persistency and have a positive impact on agent retention.", "We are also close to 50% complete with our centralization of the lead generation at American Income. In those areas where we have assumed this responsibility lead generation increased 33% during the quarter and sales increased over 25%. We expect to have this completed by the end of next year.", "In our direct response operation, life premiums were up 6% to $127 million and life underwriting margin grew 2% to $30 million. Life net sales increased 7% to $30 million.", "While we continue to see some declines in our response rates in our insert media, we have however seen some very encouraging test results in both our pricing and packaging in this media during the third quarter. We believe these changes will more than offset this decline in response rates although it is too early to project 2009 sales for the distribution system. We will do so on the next call.", "At Liberty National, life premiums declined 1% to $72 million and life underwriting margin declined 4% to $18 million. Net life sales grew 47% to $13 million and the agent count was 3476, up 69% from a year ago.", "I continue to be pleasantly surprised by the sales growth at Liberty National and expect it to continue. While collected premiums and margins decline slightly the sales have now reached a level to Liberty National can contribute meaningful growth in both premiums and underwriting margins for 2009.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 9% to $231 million and health underwriting margin was down 7% to $42 million. The health net sales declined 49% to $29 million. The health sales results of United American continue to deteriorate in both branch office and independent agency channels. This market remains highly competitive and also appears to be negatively impacted by the economy.", "We are continuing our efforts to shift sales into life and supplemental health products which have higher margins and better persistency. I would also like to point out that a major portion of our health underwriting profits are generated at Liberty National and American Income. While these distribution systems account for only 23% of our health premiums, they contribute roughly 44% of our health underwriting profit after administrative expenses.", "Premium revenue from Medicare Part D was down 21% to $41.5 million. Although underwriting margin was flat at $6.4 million, primarily as a result of a renegotiated contract with our pharmacy benefit management.", "Administrative expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 4% from a year ago. Year-to-date administrative expenses were up a half of 1% and are in line with our expectations.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments on our investment operations.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, liquidity and capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our Web site are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30th 2008. They are included under supplemental financial information in the financial reports and other financial information section of our Investor Relations page.", "As indicated on these schedules invested assets are $10.1 billion with fixed maturities included amortized costs. Of this amount $9.6 billion are in fixed maturities. Combined, equities, mortgage loans and real estates are $42 million, less than 1% of invested assets. We have no counterparty risk as we hold no credit to default swaps for other derivatives. In addition, we do not operate a securities lending program.", "Of the $9.6 billion of fixed maturities $8.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $698 million with an average rating of BB minus and are 7.3% of fixed maturities compared to 7.8% a year ago. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB plus compared to A minus, a year ago.", "Net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio are $1.4 billion, up from the $670 million at the end of the second quarter. By sector, the largest losses are in the financials which comprise 42% of the portfolio at amortized cost, but 64% of the total net unrealized losses.", "Almost 85% of the total increase in unrealized losses during the quarter was related to bonds for which there were no downgrades in their ratings. Accordingly, we feel that most of the unrealized losses reflect the current liquid market that is contributed to a significant spread widening on bonds that are likely to be money good. Obviously, this is not a market to be a seller of bonds and due to the strong and stable positive cash flow generated by our insurance products we not only have the intent to hold our bonds to maturity, but more important, we have the ability to do so.", "Now, I would like to discuss the asset types and sectors within the fixed maturity portfolio. At asset type 78% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 15% is in redeemable preferred stocks. There is no direct exposure to subprime or Alt-A. We have only $41 million in RMBS and CMBS securities, all rated AAA.", "A CDO exposure is a $131million in which the underlying collateral is bank and insurance company trust preferred. The average rating of these securities is A minus with none rated less than BBB.", "Regarding sectors as I mentioned, the financial sector comprises $4 billion or 42% of the portfolio. Within financials, the Life held property casualty insurance sector is $1.8 billion and banks are $1.6 billion. Financial guarantors and mortgage insurers total $180 million less than 2% of the portfolio.", "Next financial is the \u2013 the next largest sector is utilities which account for $1 billion or 11% of the portfolio. The remaining $4.6 billion of fixed maturities is a spread among 242 issuers in nine sectors.", "Now to conclude the discussion on investments I will cover the portfolio yield. In the third quarter we invested $263 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and utility sectors. We have invested an average annual effective yield of 7%, an average rating of A minus and an average life depending on future calls of between 26 years and 28 years. This compares to the 6.84% yield A rating and 22 year to 30 year average life of bonds acquired in the third quarter of last year.", "This is the fourth consecutive quarter that the new money yield was 7% or higher and also exceeded the portfolio yield. The average yield on the portfolio in the third quarter was 6.97% versus the same as has been for the last four sequential quarters.", "Now regarding liquidity and capital, our insurance companies primarily sell basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. In the third quarter only $3 million or 0.5% of premium revenue came from asset accumulation products where revenue is subject to changes in equity markets.", "Regulatory capital remain sufficient to support our current operations and ratings. As noted in previous calls our RBC ratio is just under 300% at December 31st 2007. It had dropped below our 300% plus target due to several unusual one-time items.", "In 2008 we have increased statutory capital primarily through intercompany transactions involving reinsurance and monetization of agent receivables. Even with the $70 million other than temporary impairment write-down in the third quarter, we expect RBC at 12/31/08 to be in the range of 305% to 315%.", "Finally, regarding capital management, Torchmark has no plans to raise equity capital or reduce dividends to shareholders. Cash flow at the insurance companies and free cash flow to the holding company remains strong. Free cash flow will be approximately $350 million in 2008 and although we haven't done our projections we expect 2009 free cash flow to also be in excess of $300 million.", "We have already used our 2008 free cash to purchase Torchmark shares. In the third quarter we spent $116 million to buy 2 million shares, and for the nine months we have spent $351 million in acquiring 5.9 million shares. Although we have already used our available cash for this year, we still have the ability to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter with funds raised through the issuance of commercial paper. In fact, to-date in the fourth quarter, we have spent $64 million to buy 1.4 million shares.", "Although we have explored making a strategic acquisition, the probability of such a transaction in the near-term is unlikely. At our current share price we would be reluctant to issue equity and in the current market it would be difficult to issue a sizable debt offering in order to finance acquisition. Thus, given the current conditions, share repurchases and to some extent reduction of short-term debt will be the best use of our available cash. Those are my comments. I will now turn it back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. We are lowering our guidance for operating earnings per share for 2008 to a range of $5.85 to $5.89 due to the unforeseen changes in the credit and equity markets. After tax variances from our previous guidance include lower underwriting income on our variable annuity business between $1.1 million and $2.4 million in the fourth quarter. Lower investment income of $1.2 million due to loss interest on Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and Fannie Mae bonds. Increased cost of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of $1.2 million and roughly $1.6 million of parent company expense related to an acquisition in which we have withdrawn from negotiations.", "In summary, we believe Torchmark is in good shape. Our core life businesses are growing sales at a double-digit pace during tough economic conditions and we continue to generate strong predictable cash flows and earnings. Those are my comments this morning. I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And we will take our first question from Jeff Schuman at KBW.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Good morning. Wanted to come back to the issue of share repurchase. Obviously you do have very strong and steady cash flows which is a nice buffer and certainly the stock is very cheap. Is there any thought at this point, Gary, to maybe conserving capital for a while? I mean certainly I think in terms of trying to impress investors, all the conversations we have with investors at this point are in terms of measuring downside risk not so much in terms of who can kind of juice ROE or EPS the most next year so. Can you give us few more thoughts there please?", "Gary Coleman", "Jeff, we are not just buying the stock to be aggressive. The stock is trading \u2013 has been trading below book value that makes it a more compelling buy than even it has been in the past. We are not going to jeopardize our capital. We have spent $64 million in the fourth quarter. I wouldn't expect us to spend more than $30 million in the remainder of the quarter. If we went over that, I think we would start getting outside of the boundaries of our ratings. I think it would be wise to stop at that point. The additional commercial paper that we have used \u2013 the additional borrowing we are also not looking at leaving that out in a long period of time as 2009 gets underway and pre-cash \u2013 or cash starts coming up to the parent company. I think as I mentioned in my comments you will see as reducing our short-term debt. But it's just really more a matter of the price at the moment.", "Mark McAndrew", "We also, Jeff, took a very hard look at our downside risk before we made the decision to go out. We just think our downside risk is minimal.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Maybe just to complete the picture, in terms of capital management, I know, Gary, you mentioned that you were able to kind of do some transactions and manage the RBC ratio a little bit. Do you have additional flexibility to kind of manage RBC little bit structurally or not?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I think we do.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Any sense of how much that's worth?", "Gary Coleman", "Not offhand. It would \u2013 I think we've been fairly conservative with our regulatory capital and there is still some room there. I can't put a number on it at the moment.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar at JP Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, thank you. I just have a question on your outlook for the ageing count especially at United American. It's been declining the last several quarters. When do you think it will bottom out and what are some of the things you are doing to try to improve that? And then with that if you could address your outlook for health insurance sales as well.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Jimmy, I wish I could be certain of where and when that will bottom out. The ageing count continues to decline. We are trying to move more of that production to Liberty National products which we're seeing some success with. But I really \u2013 I can't say with any certainty where and when it will bottom out. We are introducing a new under age 65 health insurance products started here in the last 30 days which we think will help that, but I wish I give you more guidance. It just comes down to, again, it's a very competitive and volatile market, and it's something at long-term, it's not a market that I really see as being a market that we want to be in long-term. So we are definitely spending most of our focus on the life and other supplemental health products that are more profitable and more persistent.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "And then just on the life business, have you seen any impact recently of the economy weakening on your sales, obviously, the numbers in the third quarter were pretty good.", "Mark McAndrew", "I haven't seen any \u2013 again, I think in the markets that we're in and the products we are selling true protection products, very simple products. We haven't seen any significant impact in our persistency of the business, and we are not seeing obviously, Liberty National sales were up 47%. American Income sales were strong. The only place we have seen anything, Jimmy, is in the insert media, in the direct response where these are more newspaper inserts and the coupon packs. We deal with a little lower income marketplace there. We have seen some decline in some response rates there although it's pretty well stabilized now. That's the only place we have seen anything. And again, as I mentioned earlier, actually, some of the product and pricing test that we have done in the third quarter we have seen very encouraging results as far as improving the profitability and improving the number of sales we are getting there. So I think that will offset that decline and we are \u2013 we sure like to see gas prices go down. I don't think any of our markets are affected by changes in the equity markets, but I do believe that lower gas prices can do nothing but help our markets.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "Good morning. I must stay short of Jeff's theme. Your stock is down 45% in the last quarter and Mark and Gary, your story sounds like not much has changed and you are doing your thing and taking advantage of it, and clearly, you think the markets got it wrong. The whole markets got it wrong with respect to credit because you seem awfully relaxed about your exposure to that issue. Have you done any stress test or sensitivity analysis to test whether in fact the market is right on this, how bad things could get and you are still fine in the cash and \u2013 ?", "Mark McAndrew", "I will let Gary answer more fully. Yes, we have, Bob. It comes down to \u2013 we had a bad third quarter if you look at the write downs we had to take. But in looking we could sustain those same level of losses throughout every quarter, fourth quarter this year and every quarter next year and be fine. We would not have to raise equity. The unrealized losses that we see in our portfolio, again, we have the ability and the intent to hold those bonds. It doesn't affect our statutory earnings. We don't believe it's going to have any effect on us being able to dividend money up to the parent. Yes, we have looked at it quite a bit here in the last three months. Gary, you want to comment?", "Gary Coleman", "Just add to that, as Mark mentioned if we sustain $70 million of losses in the fourth quarter and each quarter next year, we can do that and still keep our capital at the insurance companies above the 300% level. What that would mean is our free cash flow would go toward staying in the companies if we had those extreme losses, we wouldn't have the share repurchases. But \u2013 our earnings growth wouldn't be as high. We would still have earnings growth. The key thing here is that our \u2013 the types of products we write are not subject to equity market swings. I mean, there is \u2013 very consistent and we look for our profits to be consistent going forward. So \u2013", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "I appreciate that. It's just that the credit markets have the bonds marked right we're going to have more Wachovia's in the next quarter. I am sure you are expecting some more if we go into recession. I mean if the BBB plus portfolio is going to start, have it some stress from cash flow and statutory perspective.", "Gary Coleman", "I look at this way. First of all, I think we do have \u2013 versus our peers, we have a high BBB exposure. But as I mentioned I think that's offset to large extent we have no equity, mortgage or real estate exposure. In addition, we have \u2013 we've done a great deal \u2013 We do a great deal of credit research not only when we buy but follow-up on our BBB bonds. We're comfortable with those bonds. The other thing I mentioned is if you look at our BBB bonds they are 48% of the portfolio. The unrealized losses for BBBs are 49% of the total unrealized losses. In other words, the unrealized losses are spread throughout the portfolios at all ratings and it's \u2013 I mean I would be more concerned if 49% were BBBs and we had 89% of the total unrealized losses of BBBs. I think I will be more concerned. But I think the fact that see the spread indicate that it is just reflective of illiquid market throughout and we think it's going to improve. I hate to think that is more concerning to us is that out of our $70 million loss that we booked this quarter, $50 million was in Lehman Brothers, and a week before it went in bankruptcy, Lehman was rated A. It was a surprise to everybody. Those are the ones that you can't predict. It concerns us there maybe some of those out there.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "One last question, your debt to capital ratio year-over-year is up from 22 to 28. And mostly it's the AOCI [ph] hitting the denominator more than debt levels going up. Fourth quarter we are off to another sort of crappy start. Is there a debt to capital ratio that starts to become a material issue or not?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, if you exclude the ALCI [ph], it's \u2013 we are 22.6% which is in line with where we have been. And I know the rating agencies are looking at that. But they generally look at it excluding unrealized losses. So still even at 28% using that basis, I think we are probably okay.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "There is no bank covenant issues \u2013 ?.", "Gary Coleman", "No, definitely no bank covenant issues at all.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "Thank you, Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "Sure.", "Operator", "We will go next to Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks, everyone. I noticed from the press release that AIG was not included in the impairment this quarter. From Gary I was just hoping to get some color on that. How that decision was arrived at, maybe where those are and how you are looking at that exposure in particular, I think it's about $105 million.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, it is $105 million. Randy, the $57 million of the $105 is bonds of the operating subsidiaries, and, of course, everybody is looking for those to be sold and assume that the bonds will go along with them. The other roughly $48 million is \u2013 $27 million is senior secured debt at the holding company and then another $22 million is junior subordinated debt at the holding company. Obviously, we have exposure there. The exposure is if they go into bankruptcy. We're not going to sell the bonds. And so at this point we do not write them down because at this point we don't have anything to indicate that they will go into bankruptcy and we are set to monitor that situation as we go forward.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Great. And then moving to commercial paper. Could you give color on how well you are able to roll that now? You quantified the higher expense for us which is very helpful, but maybe some color on how that market is moving and then how your ratings I believe are A1P2 might coincide with the CPFF, commercial paper funding facility that the Federal Reserve has organized, and if that would be something that you would consider accessing?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, we would. You're right about the A1P2. But we also have an F1 from Fitch. And as a result of having those two higher ratings, we are eligible to be in the CPFF program and in fact, we have registered and we should be able to start accessing that market late next week. The situation regarding commercial paper prior to September 15th it was pretty easy. We just determined how much we needed, we got it immediately, we got pretty much whatever maturities we wanted to. It didn't go up more than 30 days. Since that time, we have been able to place the commercial paper that we needed. In fact, we have issued more than has matured. But we are seeing maturities more in the 10 \u2013 we are seeing it for a while just one day paper. But we \u2013 now, it's more in the 10, 11 day maturities and as I mentioned the price has gone up. We were \u2013 our interest rate there was less than 3% prior and now it's closer to 6%.", "So we have been able to place the paper. We are paying quite a bit more. Now what the CPFF will do for us when we get involved with that. We will be eligible to sell up to $300 million of commercial paper. It will be 90-day paper. As you probably know the rate that we paid on that is an overnight rate index plus a spread and today that rate is about 3%. So as we are able to payoff the CP that's out right now and then borrow into the CPFF, we will see our rate transition from the 6% level for the first half of the quarter to more of a 3% rate towards the end of the quarter.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "And that's 3% all in index plus spread and then \u2013 is that correct?", "Gary Coleman", "That's correct. That's today. That rate will change. But where it stands today it's about 3%.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "I mean so I guess the CPFF I think last forever. So is it \u2013 how do you view it as a transition to more normal credit markets? Are you committed to continuing to use short-term debt on the balance sheet or would you want to transition out and rely more on kind of the natural cash flow of the organization?", "Gary Coleman", "Historically, our short-term debt has averaged around $200 million. Going over $300 million has been an unusual event for us. And really, we use it \u2013 the timing of our cash flow is coming up from the insurance companies, varies, and so we use it just for short-term needs. I don't think that's going to vary going forward. I think the last under the CPFF the last paper can be issued in April, late April, and so really \u2013 and that's 90 days. So what \u2013 between now and the end of June next year, we will be using that program, if nothing else, one, to reduce our costs that we are paying down to commercial paper and then secondly, we also \u2013 we would rather not draw on our bank line. We haven't done that. And this program will help us lower the cost without having to draw on that bank loan. But overall, I think we're not going to ramp up all the full $300 million under this program and borrow the full amount we can under our short-term line. I think in the long run you will see that commercial paper going back to about $200 million average.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "Just real quick, can you remind us what the bank line is?", "Gary Coleman", "Pardon?", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "What's the capacity of the bank line?", "Gary Coleman", "Our bank line is \u2013 we have $600 million line, we have $200 million dedicated to letter of credit. So the least $400 million for either borrowing or back up for commercial paper.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Good morning. Wanted to just come back to the question of free cash flow and how you are thinking about the environment. So if the plan is to have $300 million of free cash flow, I assume that contemplates very little credit losses for ' 09. I just wanted to get clarification of that.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I'm saying $300 million plus with no credit losses.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. So essentially, what we can think about is $300 million after tax credit losses on a static counting basis being the thing that would start wipe out your free cash flow for the year. So on a free tax basis what the $450 million which would be what 4% to 5% of your entire investment portfolio. Is that the right way to think about the stress test here?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. The other question is have you had any discussions with the rating agencies just in terms of continuing your buy back and whether or not that could put some pressure on your ratings?", "Gary Coleman", "We've had just some preliminary discussions, but nothing in detail. We have \u2013 I think they have a good feel for our risk profile. The way we look at that free cash \u2013 that is free cash. If we need to put some back into the insurance companies to maintain our capital not only from a regulatory standpoint but also from the rating agencies, we can do that. We have the flexibility to do so. So \u2013 to answer your question, we haven't had in-depth discussions. We will probably do that later. But we don't have anything that will restrict us.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "And can you talk a little bit about how important ratings are to your franchise? The reason I ask that is you've got some other life insurers who have pretty good capital positions even further truing up their \u2013 or strengthening their capital positions over sort of prospective fear of any negative rating actions. Can you talk a little bit about how the balancing act? How important is your rating and how you sort of view that with your planning process here?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Gary, I will address it on the marketing side. In the markets that we're in and \u2013 again, we're not really marketing any investment type products. We're really selling small face amount life insurance primarily in middle and lower middle income markets. The only rating we've been advertise is A best rating which is A plus. If that rating were to drop a notch to A, I don't think it would have any impact at all on our life sales. We don't want to see it drop, but I don't see any impact on the marketing side of any ratings change.", "Gary Coleman", "I would add \u2013 I mentioned that our commercial paper ratings are A1P2 and F1. We would definitely like to keep two of those at the one level. So that's a consideration.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. And then last question more on the business side. So is it fair to say with the very weak health insurance sales and barring something unusual as we think about '09 we will see premium revenue on the health side decline double-digits? Only because you are seeing much larger decline in sales which should be a leading indicator of where premium revenue goes next year. Would that be a fair conclusion at this point?", "Mark McAndrew", "It's \u2013 again, we will give more guidance on the next call. It's really difficult to say. It's possible. Again, I don't think you will see underwriting margins decline because the premiums that we're losing are the least profitable premiums we got out there. And it's just difficult to predict at this point. But it's possible that we could see double-digit declines in health premiums, but I don't think we will see that in health margins. But again, we will give more guidance on that on the next call.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to John Nadel, Sterne, Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "Hi, good morning, everybody. Mark, maybe just a quick philosophical question for you. If the businesses is less impacted or not impacted at an A rating versus an A plus or versus \u2013 let's say a low AA, I guess I wonder why not manage the \u2013 from especially from a capital management perspective to the A rating?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, as far as \u2013 we pay more attention to the S&P and Moody's ratings as far as our credit concerned and Gary, you can address that. Those are more important to us \u2013", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "For the holding company, right?", "Mark McAndrew", "Right.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "And then I guess A.M. Best obviously on the insurance side? Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes. We do take pride in A plus, but if there was a compelling reason that we decided to manage to an A rating, but we are basically already dividending out the statutory earnings each year from the subsidiary companies and that's really we're able to maintain an A plus rating by doing so.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "Okay. A follow-up question maybe on the investment portfolio and thinking about a little bit of sensitivity around the risk-based capital ratio. Mindful that a fair amount of the portfolio at the insurance subsidiaries is in BBB category, if \u2013 in the sensitivities that you discussed a little bit earlier in the Q&A, have you taken a look at the sensitivity to your risk-based capital levels? Should you see downgrades from the BBB to a BB or below rating category and what that means from a risk-based capital perspective? How much of that can you sustain?", "Gary Coleman", "To answer your question, no, we haven't looked at that. Well, I say that, our projections take in, in fact that we at times do have downgrades. We haven't, we didn't go in and stress test that we would have a big multiple of more downgrades. We didn't do that, but we haven't seen that so far and if we do we will revise the test. I'm not sure how much impact that will have. We will take a look at it.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "Okay. I think I understand that the capital charges, I guess they become increasingly difficult the lower the rating category.", "Gary Coleman", "They do. It's just \u2013 again, we just haven't seen \u2013 matter of fact we had less downgrades this quarter than we had the prior which is well, we certainly hadn't that many downgrades in the lower investment grade portfolio.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "Okay. And then finally, Mark, I wouldn't necessarily expect you to name the company you were looking at. But \u2013 can you give us a sense for, to the extent that there was \u2013 and it sounds like there is a lot of at least discussion of various opportunities out there. Maybe some significantly bigger in size and maybe more out of your comfort zone, but could you give us a sense for where you most interested, what sort of deal characteristics would be important in terms of metrics especially around accretion? Would you be willing to suffer some dilution or no?", "Mark McAndrew", "We were willing to. When we started looking at this particular company, the \u2013 it was not in the current environment. Our stock was up around $63 a share and the credit markets we felt comfortable we could raise the cash at a reasonable price. But it all went away. So in this environment we don't \u2013 we basically put that on the back burner. Because \u2013 are we willing to issue equity at our current price? No, I'm not willing to issue equity to make an acquisition at the current stock price and also the credit markets are such, as Gary mentioned, we couldn't raise the capital anyway. So unless it was the size of an acquisition that we could basically make with our free cash in the next 12 months, anything larger than that at this point we couldn't do if we wanted to. The valuations that you are seeing are very attractive, but we just \u2013 we wouldn't be willing to take that credit risk.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee", "", "Yes. Understood. Thanks very much for the openness.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Maria Panamar [ph] at New York Life.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "Hi. I have several questions. The first one is if you could address liquidity at the holding company and how you intend to refinance the August '09 debt maturity?", "Gary Coleman", "We have a $100 million coming due. And at this point our preference would be to refinance that. If it is happening today, it would be difficult to do that. We would have to use our free cash flow to retire that debt. But that's \u2013 in August when that comes about and when we get to that point, hopefully, the debt markets will be open again and we can refinance it. If not, we may have to allocate a hundred million of our free cash flow to retire.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "With regards to your bank line, are there any restrictions there whether \u2013 could you talk about any restrictions as it relates to either ratings or leverage or net worth?", "Gary Coleman", "There are regarding net worth and leverage, but we are not anywhere near approaching those. We are well within our covenants.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "Could you talk about what those covenants might be?", "Gary Coleman", "I don't recall at the moment. But I know that there \u2013 again, I can't recall the exact ones but we're well within it.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "And just a liquidity of the holding company, how much cash you might have there?", "Gary Coleman", "As far as cash, we have very low cash at the holding company at the moment. As I mentioned we've \u2013 the free cash flow for this year, we've used for share repurchases today. We don't have assets at the holding company. All our assets are down in the insurance companies, but we do \u2013 as far as liquidity at the holding company, we do have the bank line I mentioned earlier and the ability to issue commercial paper under that bank line and that's what we are using for liquidity at the moment.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "Okay. And then just finally, you have some preferred stocks in your portfolio. What industry would those \u2013 are those also financials, redeemable preferred stock?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, the bulk of those are financials. I don't have that right here in front of me. But I know they are mostly in banks and insurance companies.", "Maria Panamar \u2013 New York Life", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Steven Schwartz, Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey, good morning, everybody. So no intention of recreating 1990 and going back after American General?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "If you can tell me how I can raise that much money \u2013 yes, if you can guarantee me loans that I can issue equity at $60 a share, we would be happy to go look at it.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay, I will remember that if the stock goes back up. A couple of questions here. Gary, first, you were moving along pretty fast. You stated a number I think it was the percentage of the increase in the unrealized loss that was due to downgrades. Could you give that number again?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay, I must have been going fast. We said that 85% of the increase in the unrealized losses from the second quarter were in bonds where there was no change in rating. There was no downgrade.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Being 15%. Okay. Following up under this question of AIG it sounded your impairment policy was \u2013 if the underlying company entered bankruptcy or not. I don't know if this is accurate or not but S&L has you having about 41 million or so of National City, maybe if that is accurate, maybe you can discuss that and what your thoughts are there vis-\u00e0-vis impairment?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, we do have 47 million. There again as far as our analysis is that that we don't think they are not going into bankruptcy, that there is not an impairment at this time. There is a possibility that that will happen, but we are again \u2013 as we mentioned, we are not going to be selling these type assets. It's going to be whether they do go into bankruptcy.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then I don't remember. Is Rosemary there by any chance?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "I am here.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Hi, Rosemary. Could you in the second quarter \u2013 if I remember correctly, you had a little bit of a mortality issue. Maybe you can address how things turned out in the third quarter. I heard there was no mention and then I think your bidding is done for Part D. Maybe you can touch on an outlook for Part D in '09?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Sure. Yes, for the second quarter, we had mortality issues that we talked about in three of our lines, Liberty National direct response and I believe United investors and of the first two, the claims did come back down as we had predicted. So we didn't see any mortality issues remain there. United investors did still have higher claims in the third quarter than what we had anticipated. However, we had gone back and done a little bit more analysis of that and that's just a line that has high average size policies, but low volume in terms of claims. So it can fluctuate. And we went back and looked at the higher average size claims, ones over $250,000 and that's really where the fluctuation was. It wasn't a fluctuation in terms of number of claims to any great extent.", "Mark McAndrew", "If I could, Rosemary, just add in looking back at the prior two years, 2006, 2007, claims over $250,000 at United investors, we average one a month. In the second and third quarter this year we average 3 months. But those were on average roughly $400,000 claim. And that is the fluctuation. The claims under $250,000 that very stable, and so we continue \u2013 I continue to believe that it's just a blip, but \u2013 sorry, Rosemary, go ahead.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "That's fine. In regard to Part D, we really aren't anticipating any much difference in terms of what we're going to do in 2009. Our products are going to be pretty similar. We didn't change the rate a whole lot. We have lowered our benefit structure. We lowered our co-pays because of expected improvement in the discounts that we're getting off of the drug costs. We are expecting still that our underwriting margin will continue to be 11% next year. As far as the outlook for the fourth quarter of this year, I had originally anticipated that due to the discounts that we were going to get off of the drugs that we would also show a 15% underwriting margin for the fourth quarter. However, our actual to expected for this year is running a little bit over 1. And now I don't think that we are really going to see that 15% continue into the fourth quarter and it will probably go back down to the level it was in the first six months of this year.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We will go next to Lynn David [ph] at KBW Asset Management.", "Lynn David \u2013 KBW Asset Management", "", "Hi. Thanks, guys. Did you mention at the beginning of the call that you did some intercompany transactions that helped RBC? Can you give us how much they helped RBC and if you can explain a little more about what kind of transactions they were, little more detail?", "Gary Coleman", "As I mentioned it involved reinsurance and monetization of agents receivables, agents balances are not admitted for regulatory capital purposes and we were able to sell those intercompany to one of our companies that's where we can admit them. That was \u2013 I think that's probably $20 million plus that we were able to increase capital. The reinsurance was I think a little over $50 million of additional capital that we were able to do there. Again, those are \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, there is \u2013 there maybe some more capacity there. We are trying to be conservative when doing that.", "Lynn David \u2013 KBW Asset Management", "", "On the reinsurance, is that done through a third party or done through sub?", "Gary Coleman", "This is all intercompany.", "Lynn David \u2013 KBW Asset Management", "", "So you got some subsidiaries that are over capitalized still. Is that what you are saying?", "Gary Coleman", "We have a Bermuda company. It's a Torchmark company. When we do the reinsurance, we are transferring \u2013 we are reinsuring policies that have deficiency reserves in the United American, Liberty National, we are reinsuring those with our Bermuda company, and Bermuda company is not required to set up a deficiency reserves. A lot of people do that with outside reinsurance. We just certainly do it inside. The cost to us doing that is we have to have letters of credit to support the amount of the insurance, but that's a very low cost. And so, this doing that reinsurance is a low cost way of increasing the statutory surplus of Liberty National, United American globe.", "Lynn David \u2013 KBW Asset Management", "", "Got you. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to John Lanford [ph], Royal Capital [ph].", "John Lanford \u2013 Royal Capital", "", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just another question on the investment book. If you look at the roughly $600 million increase in mark-to-market charges that occurred in the third quarter and roll that forward, obviously given the volatility we have had thus far this month, any estimate of what the charge would be today?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, we have done an estimate. We think that we were $1.4 billion of net earned losses at the end of September, we think that would be $1.9 billion now.", "John Lanford \u2013 Royal Capital", "", "Okay. So roughly another $500 million, right? And can you talk a little bit about how that actually would \u2013 is that offset at all by some back write ups or how that would actually manifest itself in your book value?", "Gary Coleman", "There is just a small amount of a back offset. Because we have very little business that's asset accumulation type business where you have that situation. So really it's immaterial as to how much of that part of it is.", "John Lanford \u2013 Royal Capital", "", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Jeff Schuman at KBW.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Thanks, again. Just wanted to clean up a few numbers. When you were talking about the changed guidance I think you mentioned its impact, the variable annuities of 1.1 million \u2013 to 2.4 million. I wasn't sure. Is that a delta that we should apply towards your normal run rate? Is that what we should do?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, obviously that depends on what the stock market does between now and year end, but that's kind of the range that we see the potential in the fourth quarter. Obviously if the Dow goes back to 11,000, we won't have those losses, but Rosemary, you want to comment?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Yes, I would like to add one additional thing. That was definitely related to two things really. We had been seeing higher than expected lapses in that line. So that takes that into account, but also the bulk of it really is based on the fund balances. It does depend on what would happen to that in the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "I wasn't quite sure what the numbers meant. Is that a delta versus a run rate or it's an estimation that you would actually lose \u2013", "Mark McAndrew", "We were anticipating underwriting margins of about $750,000 in the fourth quarter. Yes, it would translate \u2013 not all of that would be a loss, but we are now expecting to take a loss in that line of business in the fourth quarter.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Okay. And that view is as of 930 or as of more recently given the subsequent market decline?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "It's actually as of 930 with some estimate as to what we think could happen as of year-end.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Okay. And then \u2013 I'm not sure I transcribed very well. Did you specify an amount for the impact of the lower investment income on the securities?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, it was $1.2 million after tax.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from John Hall of Wachovia.", "John Hall \u2013 Wachovia", "Thanks very much. I'm just going to go back to the topic of acquisition and capital, a little bit now. I wanted to be clear about your walking away from the deal was a function of financing as opposed to pricing or anything else?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "John Hall \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Secondly, as you look at that M&A environment, how would you categorize sort of the pricing environment? Are public multiples at a lower point than what private multiples are? Are they roughly in sync?", "Gary Coleman", "The multiples that you are willing to pay \u2013 again, acquisitions, the size you are talking about with AIG, most anyone is going to have to raise some equity to make that type of acquisition and if \u2013 when you look at the price you would have to issue equity at, it obviously lowers the price you are willing to pay in an acquisition. So yes, the multiples that you are seeing for potential acquisitions are coming down, have come down.", "John Hall \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Great. I was just wondering, you had mentioned possible use of cash as buying in debt. I was just wondering what the decision process would lead you in that direction to do that?.", "Gary Coleman", "No, I was referring to there was a question there we have $100 million of maturity of our debt in August of 2009. It would be our intention to refinance that but it would be difficult to do that in today's market and if conditions persist I hope they don't, but if they do, still in August of '09 it's still this difficult, then we can instead of \u2013 if the refinancing was too costly or difficult to get, then we could use a portion of our free cash flow to pay the maturity.", "John Hall \u2013 Wachovia", "", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Richard Weiner [ph] at Citadel Investment Group.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "Great. Thank you very much. Actually, this is Dan Johnson. On \u2013 going back to just a quick question on impairment policy. On Page 13 of the supplement I think is where you got your $1.4 billion to the broken out by asset category. I think if I understand right, generally on the corporate and again on the preferreds, the intent is not to impair until effectively you think the company \u2013 the company issuing the bond will be going bankrupt or unless you intend to sell the security. I just wanted to frame that right before going and asking my question.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that's \u2013 it's maybe a little more involved than that, but I think what we have to look at is we've got these losses. If we were going to sell all our bonds, we would realize those losses. So we would either realize them by selling them or we have to do an impairment if we were going to sell them. Our position is we buy and hold to maturity. So as long as \u2013 when maturity comes they pay off the bonds, then if the market value is half the par value for that, it really doesn't make any difference. So when we are \u2013 when we are looking at this, we are trying to see what the net realizable value is going to be of the bonds and there is \u2013 indicates Lehman obviously going into bankruptcy there we are not going to recover the full value. We are going to recover something, but not the full value. But when looking at other bonds that maybe \u2013 again, their market price maybe 50% of their book, well, that's more of a sign of the market. If we were going to sell today, we would get $0.50 on the dollar, but we are not going to sell and as long as their fundamentals look good and we don't see \u2013 it looks like they will go into bankruptcy, we are not going to do other than temporary \u2013 in our minds it's not are their temporary impaired and we're not going to write it down.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "", "Regardless of the age at which those are I guess that in your mind at an unrealistically depressed price?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "", "So let's go under the CDO. You fair valued the CDO down about 80%. Two questions. One, can you remind us of the underlying collateral of that CDO and given that that's not a single entity that you can determine whether or not they are going to go to bankrupt \u2013 become bankrupt. What is the test to decide whether or not that $100 million of unrealized loss would become considered other than temporary?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, the underlying collateral on those securities are, as I mentioned earlier, trust preferred issued by banks and insurance companies, primarily \u2013 I think there is a small amount of other. We have a pretty high tranche in our stress testing, it would be substantial defaults before if we get to the point where it would affect our tranche. So but when you put that out to different brokers, what would they pay for those at particular time or what would people pay for them, again, the market is affecting it. But when you are talking about whether we are going to recover our value at this point we think their money good.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "", "The A minus rating on that CDO was that the original rating or is that I guess current rating?", "Gary Coleman", "No, that's a current rating.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "", "Has that been marked down over the last year in terms of rating downgrade?", "Gary Coleman", "No, I don't believe it has. Again, there is \u2013 we have got \u2013 there is three or four and as I mentioned the lowest is BBB, but overall they are A minus.", "Dan Johnson \u2013 Citadel Investment Group", "", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, those are our comments for today.

(Operator Instructions)  At this time, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew.

Some of my comments or answers to your questions this morning may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.  Accordingly, please refer to our 2008 10-K, which is on file with the SEC.  ", "Net operating income for the second quarter was $126 million or a $1.53 per share a per share increase of 6% from a year ago.  Net income was $114 million or $1.38 per share.  Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.9% for the quarter and our book value per share was $41.74.  On a GAPP reported basis with six maturity investments carried at market value, our book value was $31.70 per share.  ", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 2% to $415 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $111 million, life insurance net sales were $85.5 million up 12% from a year ago.  At American Income, life premiums grew 5% to $125 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $41 million.  Net life sales increased 19% to $33 million.  ", "Our producing agents at American Income grew to 3,822 up 36% from a year ago and up 24% since the first of the year.  I would also point out that without the impact of the currency conversion our sales at American Income would have been up 23% for the quarter and premiums would have grown by 8% for the quarter. ", "But for the quarter American Income contributed 30% of our total underwriting income and as our most profitable distribution system.  I'm pleased with the progress of American Income and I believe it is on track to see continued double-digit growth in new sales for the foreseeable future.  ", "In our direct response operation, life premiums were up 5% to a $135 million and life underwriting margin grew 13% to $34 million.  Net life sales increased 9% to $34 million.  Sales results in direct response were in line with our expectations and we continue to expect to see mid single-digit growth for the balance of this year with a $15 million to $20 million reduction in our acquisition expenses.  ", "Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $75 million and life underwriting margin was down $13% to $15 million.  Net life sales for the Liberty National traditional offices grew 4% to $13 million for the quarter and the producing agent count was 3,259 up 5% from a year ago but down 8.5% for the quarter.  ", "Net life sales for the UA branch offices, which are selling Liberty National products, were up 53% to $2.5 million.  Life underwriting margin at Liberty National continues to be impacted by a deterioration in our first year persistency on our non-payroll deduction business.  We have taken steps to reverse this trend, but it will take several quarters before we start to see improvement in the Liberty National underwriting margins.  ", "We've also been experiencing negative trend in our first year agent retention at Liberty National.  We have spent considerable time and effort analyzing this trend and believe that we have identified the causes and we will implement solutions during the third quarter to reverse that trend.  ", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 13% to $212 million and health underwriting margin was down 12% to $38 million.  Health net sales declined 48% to $20 million.  With healthcare reform legislation being a priority for the Obama administration, we are more convinced than ever that the market for individual primary health coverage is a dying market.  We continue to believe our decision to de-emphasize this market was the correct one.  ", "On a brighter note, our supplemental health sales at Liberty National and American Income, which have much higher margins, each grew 15% for the quarter.  Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $45 million and underwriting margin was $5 million for the quarter both in change from a year ago.  Underwriting margin from our annuity business was $5 million for the quarter versus $1 million a year ago.  ", "If our account values on our annuity business remain at second quarter levels with anticipated lapses, we expect an underwriting loss of $1.2 million for the second half of 2009.  If account values increase 10%, I'm sorry if account values decline 10% that estimated loss would be $6.6 million.  ", "If those account values increase 6%, which would be equivalent to a 980 S&P index, we would expect a gain of $1.1 million for the balance of the year.  Administrative expenses were $39.8 million for the quarter up 4% from a year ago.  For the full year, we continue to expect administrative expenses to be flat with 2008.  ", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.  ", "Gary Coleman", "", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital, first, the investment portfolio.  On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as a June 30, 2009.

Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB compared to A- a year ago.  ", "During the quarter, we charged realized capital losses for other than temporary impairments on four bounds.  The total charge was $38 million pre-tax or $17 million after-tax.  Year-to-date impairment charge of realized capital losses are $85 million pre-tax or $58 million after-tax.

Of this year-to-date increase, $554 million occurred in the first quarter and the remaining $128 million in the second quarter.

As an asset type 79% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 15% is in redeemable preferred stocks.  All of the $1.5 billion of redeemable preferreds are considered hybrid securities because they contain characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

In the second quarter we invested $246 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the utility and industrial sectors.  We invested an average annual effective yield of 7% an average rating of A-, and an average life of 17 years.  This compares to the 7% yield, A+ rating, and 22 to 33-year average life of bonds acquired in the second quarter of 2008.", "We held extra cash during the second quarter due to the uncertainty regarding commercial paper and long-term debt market.  At June 30, we had $968 million in cash in short0term investments, $343 million in the parent company, and the remainder in the insurance companies.  With the successful issuance of commercial paper outside the federal program and the $300 million debt issuance in late June, we no longer see the need to hold so much excess cash.", "We are currently in the process of investing the extra cash but the supply of bonds is more limited than in the past.  As a result, we have temporarily relaxed our objectives regarding tenure in order to have a larger supply of bonds to invest in.  Since June 30, we invested $213 million at an average yield of 6.7% and an average life of 13 to 17 years and an average rating of A.", "Next, I would like to discuss the August debt maturity, commercial paper, and capital and liquidity.  In August, we have a $99 million senior debt issue that matures.  Our preference all along has been to refinance and in late June we issued $300 million of senior notes.  From the $298 million in net proceeds, $99 million will be used to fund the August maturity, while the remaining $199 million will be available for other needs.", "On our last analyst call we announced that we are negotiating a new two-year term loan credit facility as an alternative source of funding the August maturity.  We were able to reach an agreement with our banks for $145 million facility that was slated to close in the last week of June.  However, with the improvement in the public debt market we chose to issue the senior notes instead.", "Commercial paper outstanding was $238 million at June 30 compared to $273 million at March 31 and $305 million at year-end 2008.  On June 5 Fitch lowered its rating of Torchmark's commercial paper from F1 to F2.  Due to the downgrade, the company is no longer eligible to issue in the federal CPFF Program.

In addition, investor demand continues to be more than adequate to meet our commercial paper needs.", "Regarding RBC, as previously indicated, we intend to maintain our RBC ratio at around 300%.  In the first quarter we announced that we were suspending our share repurchase program.  The program will remain suspended in the near future due to the continued uncertainty in the general economy and the likelihood of additional realized losses in rating agency downgrades of our fixed maturities.", "Now regarding RBC sensitivity, if we have no more net realized losses or downgrades for the rest of the year, we would need to put $175 million back into the insurance companies to maintain the 300% ratio.  We have performed stress tests under several different scenarios regarding impairments and downgrades for the remainder of the year.  In one scenario we assumed that impairments in the last half of the year are 1.5 times the first half's impairments and that downgrades for the last half of the year at the same level as they were in the first half.", "Under this severe scenario, we would need to put approximately $350 million into the insurance companies to maintain the 300% RBC ratio.  We don't expect to have this level of realized losses and downgrades in the second half of the year, but if we did, we have the liquidity at the parent company to maintain the 300% ratio.", "Between cash on hand and pre-cash flow in the last half of the year, the parent company has $325 million of available cash.  In addition, we have additional commercial paper and/or bank line capacity of $160 million.  These two sources give us a total of $485 million of readily available funds well in excess of the amount that we believe will be necessary to maintain the 300% RBC ratio.  In addition, other sources of liquidity such as increased credit facilities, debt issuance and inter-company financing could provide another $1.2 billion of cash.  ", "Based on the results of our stress testing, the available liquidity and the temporary suspension of share repurchases we believe that the parent company has more than sufficient liquidity to offset the impact of further realized losses and downgrades on the statutory capital of our insurance companies.", "Those are my comments.  I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "As a result of higher debt costs and lower margins at Liberty National, we are lowering our operating earnings per share guidance for 2009 to arrange a $5.93 to $6.08 per share, which assumes no share repurchase for the balance of the year.

I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar - JP Morgan", "", "Jimmy Bhullar - JP Morgan", "Mark, you spoke briefly about Liberty National.  The agent count there had been growing at a steady pace that declined sequentially.  If you can talk about what you think is causing that, what your outlook is for the rest of the year.", "And then secondly, Gary, if you could talk about just your free cash flow outlook for the rest of the year.  And just on buybacks, it doesn't seem like buybacks are likely this year, but what would you need to see next year to resume buybacks, whether it's a decline in investment losses or stability in the environment overall, if you could just discuss that.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, first off at Liberty National, Jimmy one, we made some changes back in May to improve the quality of the business we were writing and that did have some impact on the agent turnover.  But, as I mentioned in my comments and looking back at the agents we've hired in the last year, our first year turnover of new agents is at an unacceptable level.  ", "In fact, comparing it to American Income we retained more than twice as many agents for a full year than what we have been seeing at Liberty National.  We've done a lot of work to analyze that and we believe we have solutions for that, and those will be implemented in the very near future.", "So I expect to see a turnaround third quarter we may see some continued decline in the agent count.  I'm not really sure with the short-term impact, but I do believe that going forward we will see renewed growth there.  And I believe strongly that our retention of those agents will be better and also that the quality of business we're writing will be better.  But it may well be the fourth quarter before we see those numbers increase significantly. Gary, do you want to take the second piece?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, from our free cash flow for the year, we have $45 million in house right now and there will be another around approximately $80 million coming in the rest of the year.  As far as what it will take to resume share repurchases, I think we do want to see, I think you mentioned it we want to see some stability in terms of the investment portfolio and also, not only impairments, but downgrades.", "We have seen improvement in the second quarter in the downgrades to the effect on our RBC for downgrades in the second quarter is about half of what it was in the first quarter so we hope to continue to see improvement there.  I think once we're comfortable with where we stand in terms of impairments downgrades then I think we would be open to start share repurchase program again. ", "Mark McAndrew", "I would emphasize that to you, Jimmy.  What happens in the next couple of quarters will have a big impact on that.  As Gary mentioned in his comments, we're looking at $325 million of free cash at the parent right now.  It's something we'll take a look at between now and the end of the year but, obviously, downgrades and impairments are going to have an impact on that because it will impact the free cash that we have for next year.  ", "So as we get closer to the end of the year and we see how much available cash we have for this year as well as what our expected free cash flow is for next year, we'll have a better idea.  But we definitely won't be buying back any in the third quarter. ", "Jimmy Bhullar - JP Morgan", "Then finally on the health business, like the sales have, obviously, been pretty weak, is there a chance that they improve?  And there had also been talk about maybe Med Advantage reimbursement rates being cut, given the Democrat control of Congress, does it seem like there's any move in that direction.  Just would be interested in your views on that. ", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, I think as far as the Medicare Advantage rates being cut, I think that's a very high probability because even without the Medicare or the Healthcare Reform Legislation that's in Congress now, they've already earmarked some cuts to just pay for the changes in the physician reimbursement in the Medicare program.  ", "But they fully intend to, everything I've seen, they intend to cut those reimbursement rates back to be at least equal to traditional Medicare over the next three or four years.  I haven't seen any numbers on dis-enrollments for 2010.  I've heard at least rumor that there's going to be a significant number, but I don't think any of those numbers have been made public at this point.  ", "So I don't know when but I think the Medicare supplement market will come back over the next year to two years.  I don't know that it will be what it was at our peak, but I don't intend to get back into emphasizing the under age 65 primary coverage individual health insurance marketplace.  I just don't think there's a future in that it's also very regulated, very volatile and as we're seeing right now, it can be regulated away by an act of Congress and it's just not a market that we really want to be in. ", "And in fact if we were still writing the level of business we were writing a year or two ago, I would be very concerned about our [DAC].  So we're comfortable that the products we're marketing today, the worksite, the truly supplemental products that we're marketing at Liberty National and American Income are not going to be effected by the Federal Legislation.  But we will continue to de-emphasize that under age 65 primary coverage market place. ", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, I'd like to add one thing back on the cash mentioned $125 million from free cash flow we also have the $200 million excess debt proceeds over what's going to be required for that August maturity.  So the total of the $125 million free cash flow plus that $200 million is the $325 million of available cash that I referred to earlier.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JP Morgan", "And the most you expect to have to put down under a stress scenario, I think, is $350, right? ", "Gary Coleman", "Right. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Colin Devine - Citigroup.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "A couple questions, first markets seems, at least to me I'm hearing a bit of a different tone with respect to the commitment to maintaining the RBC ratio at 300.  And I certainly had the impression, and perhaps I'm mistaken, last quarter that if a downgrade happened you weren't really going to try to defend it by boosting up the RBC ratio.  Has there been a change in your thinking on that, is question one.  And then I guess I missed it but I didn't catch what you said was the problem with agent retention that you've identified and are now taking steps to correct.  What was causing that high turnover? ", "Mark McAndrew", "First, on the 300% RBC we've always managed to a 300% RBC, not that there's any requirement to maintain that, we've tried to manage to that level of RBC strictly to maintain our ratings.  But what we found is some of our rating agencies have changed their criteria.  And in fact we saw that we were downgraded even though we felt comfortable that we could maintain a 300% RBC and we kept our debt-to-equity at an acceptable level. ", "So I don't know that there's any magic about the 300% RBC.  But we have the ability to do it, that's something we're still going to evaluate through the balance of the year.  And I can't really say at this point for certainty, whether we'll put the money back down into the insurance companies or buy bonds out of the insurance companies to maintain the 300% RBC or we may let it slip a little below that.  But we do have the ability to maintain that RBC ratio if we choose to.  ", "Colin, what was the second part of your question?  Oh, on Liberty National?  There's a number of changes that we're making but actually one of the changes for new agents that we've hired, for their first I believe eight months, we set a bonus threshold of $950 a sales week.  And then at, I believe, beginning in month nine, we started raising that bonus threshold up to $1,450 a week, which is over a 50% increase.  And in looking at the agent retention beginning in month eight, nine, ten, the turnover actually increased significantly when it should be improving. ", "What we see at American Income is actually each month that goes by our agent retention improves.  And I think one of the big reasons is because we're raising that bonus threshold.  And that's something that we've already changed, we just changed it here in the last couple of weeks.  And I expect that is one of the changes we're making to improve that bonus threshold, but we're making some or to change the retention we are making some changes in our management compensation too, to better reward the retention of the agents, not just the recruiting and initial training.  ", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citigroup", "Then one quick follow up, you have obviously chosen some very strong success in life sales, records for the first half again.  How much longer can you keep this pace going? ", "Mark McAndrew", "I don't see that there's no reason why we can't maintain it indefinitely.  Again, as I've mentioned on several calls, that we don't believe that the economy affects it, even at Liberty.  I can't blame that quality of business or slowdown of the growth on the economy.  ", "American Income, there growth is accelerating.  I'm sure we'll have some bumps in the road in the future there, but there's no reason why we can't double those sales.  In fact, that is our goal over the next few years to double those sales.  Direct response, we've actually been conservative in our distribution this year in an effort to improve our margins there, but it's grown dramatically over the last 25 years.  ", "I don't see any reason why it can't continue to grow and I think the prospects for Liberty are much better going forward than they have been.  I don't see an end to it.  I think we can continue it indefinitely.  I still say that the middle class individual life insurance marketplace, the blue-collar marketplace is the most underserved marketplace out there.  ", "There's very little competition in that marketplace and it's a huge market.  And [inaudible] did a study a couple years ago that 74% of the people acknowledged that they didn't have enough life insurance in that marketplace.  So I think it's something we can continue indefinitely.  ", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Is the metric you want to be judged on your ability to grow the in force? ", "Mark McAndrew ", "Ultimately, I'd really prefer to be judged on by growing the bottom line. ", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "But in terms of what's going to lead to the bottom line growth, because that's the one that still seems to be struggling a little bit.  The sales are there but the in force a little bit slower than it was a few years ago. ", "Mark McAndrew", "No doubt because we basically went through a period of declining life sales and we turned that around, and we still have some quality problems at Liberty we have to fix.  Actually we're getting penalized by the Canadian dollar at American Income where we'd be seeing somewhat better growth.  But no doubt, if we're going to continue to get bottom line growth we've got to get better top line growth.  And if we continue the double-digit growth in sales, the premiums, we'll grow at a faster pace, but it will take time to get there, yes.

Given the comments about life sales and you're view that the favorable trends continue. And then I guess on the health side the offset of de-emphasizing the under age 65 with it seems like more optimisms from you on a Med Sup rebound than what I've heard in a very long time.  ", "If we think about just that the premium growth expectation longer term Torchmark, what do you think we should be looking at and then I have a follow up.  It doesn't have to be anything specific it can be three to five, five to seven, three to seven whatever you want.  ", "Mark McAndrew ", "", "Well, I don't think we'll see any significant change for the balance of this year, Ed.  I mean I think on the life side still I think we're projecting 2% for the balance of the year.  And a lot of it does have to do with how quickly we can get Liberty National back where it should be getting growth and improving the persistency of that business.  ", "It's just impossible for me to say, Ed, going out three to five years what kind of premium growth we can expect to see there.  I can work something up and have more detail on that next call, but I'm just not prepared to give a three to five year projection there.  Sorry.  ", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "But I mean it's fair to say that your assumption is that if the life sales trends continue it should be meaningfully better than 2% shouldn't it?

Well, you can take it, and I don't have the numbers right here in front of me, but you can take our total life in force.  ", "And you can look at what we're selling today that's achieving 2% growth and it's not a difficult calculation to see in order to that to 5% how much in additional sales would we have to have, because we would basically take 3% times our in force and that's how much we would have to gross sale to get it to 5% growth.  ", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "", "The follow up question, about what about just generally on the health I mean how should we think about if you're looking at what your earned premium in force is today and conflicting trends, I mean how do we think about how earned premium in force might be if we look out?  I mean I understand it's difficult but it's just something \u2013  ", "Mark McAndrew", "", "You have to look at it in segments.  The underage 65 primary coverage product is falling off very rapidly, but that will taper off as more and more of that falls off.  The Medicare supplement business even with very low level of sales is declining very slowly, and actually if you look at the other products the work site products at Liberty National and the products at American Income we're seeing growth there, and those are the high margin products.

And, as you say, that has been a really stable block over the years.  The persistency on that product is really good, but you do have to look at it in segments.  And the underage health product, particularly the one we sold in the last few years, really did fall off the books at a pretty good clip but the Medicare supplement is just a real stable block for us.

And secondly, could you talk a little bit about what you're doing in direct response in American Income?  I mean the sales continue to be real strong there and what is leading to that success?

", "Mark McAndrew", "", "If I look on the marketing side, the direct response as I always said it is a constant challenge to find ways to do things better and we've been doing that since 1985 we have seen steady consistent growth in that market.  We continue to find ways to do things better.  ", "Again, I mentioned one segment of our market place we found that actually lowering the rates that we charge improved, not only response rates, but improved persistency resulting in lower acquisition cost, higher profit margins even though we lowered the premium.  And that's contributing to the growth in net sales that we're seeing now and that will actually be reflected in improved growth in premiums going forward because of the improved persistency.  ", "We test things every quarter and we're seeing packages that are performing significantly better in some of our segments.  They're not all of the segments of our direct response or not growing at that pace, but we continue to test and we continue to find ways to do things better.  We have a very talented group of people and we have a long track record of growth in that marketplace.  ", "At American Income, there have been a number of changes we've made over the last few years that we're now seeing a positive benefit to.  One of the changes we made was we've been taking responsibility for generating the local union endorsements and the sales leads at American Income, which we've seen significant increases in the number of leads we've been able to generate.  ", "It's also allowed us to add what we call SGA's, which are the field management people out there as far as by adding those we've got more people out there building sales organizations for us.  We've made some very positive changes in the management compensation and in the agent compensation.  We have improved our agent retention at American Income, but also we've provided much more incentive at American Income, not only to recruit and train agents, but retain those agents.  ", "So it's just all the pieces are finally falling into place there.  It's taken us actually some time to get all those things put together, but it is on a very good track right now.

It would be difficult, but I expect it to continue to increase at a very good double-digit clip going forward.  It's impossible to predict exactly where we'll be a year from now, but there is no reason why we can't continue to grow the agents and grow the sales at this pace.

", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "With your sales as strong as they are up 12% year-to-date on the life side and with the in force growing much more modestly, as we've discussed earlier in the call, while we discuss that there has been an issue with lapsation, customer retention and agent retention at Liberty.  What is your sense in general about customer retention across the Torchmark businesses?  Is it about the same as it has been or has it been increasing?  ", "Mark McAndrew", "", "On the life side, Eric, at American Income or direct response we've seen no significant change in the lapsation rates on our business.  Again, American Income, even though we were reporting 5% growth in premiums other than the currency conversion because we write a fair amount of Canada.  It would've been 8%, which would've been more in line with what we would've expected and what we projected at the first of the year.

But direct response actually, again, we're seeing positive trends in our persistency there.  On the new business we're riding as a result of the rates we're charging. And we haven't seen any significant change in our renewal year lapse rates.  So, again, we still don't see the economy impacting us in that regard. ", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Two more quick ones, I want to go back to Colin's question about the risk-based capital and the rating.  I understood your answer that your response that you have historically kept your life company's at that certain risk-based capital ratios, but I wasn't clear on the issue of the rating.  You suffered the short-term ratings downgrade, but you're still reasonably highly rated from S&P.  Suppose you were downgraded?  What is your latest thinking on your willingness to take that and whether it would matter?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well that something that before we make that decision, we're going to be talking to all the rating agencies again, and getting feedback from them, because there have been some changes and they've gotten a bit more conservative as far as what we need to do maintain our ratings.  It's just something that I can't answer today, whether we'll be at 305 or at 290.  ", "Again, there's no requirement that we do that, but we have the ability to maintain the 300%.  One of the things we're looking at is actually buying some of the below investment grade bonds out of the insurance companies to try to keep the RBC up without incurring the loss.  And that may be something we do, but we just haven't decided at this point exactly where we'll be at year-end.  We'll be able to get a better idea at the end of next quarter.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "If I could just interject, my question was more oriented marked towards the rating and less towards the RBC.  It sounds like you want to defend the rating, irrespective of what that means from a RBC perspective.

Again, we don't want to be downgraded we want to maintain our ratings or improve our ratings, but we still have to look at what it costs us to do that.  And, again, our marketing is not real rating-sensitive and I think we've issued all the debt we're going to need to issue for quite some time.  So the ratings are not critical to us. ", "Gary Coleman", "", "Eric, I would add that from a [dead rating] standpoint, we'd rather keep the ratings where they are.  For example, our RBC would have to, I think, go below 250, but if for some reason we got downgraded in commercial paper rating to below \u2013 we have a number 2 rating with Fitch and Moody's.  If we got downgraded below that, that might drive up the cost and the ability to get as much commercial paper as we would need.  ", "Now on the other hand, we could maintain a lower level of commercial paper than we do, but I think it's an extreme going down below say 250 we would want to avoid that.  But, as Mark said, we've always maintained around 300.  I don't think that if we were 290 that makes that much difference, but I guess our point was its our intend is to maintain the 300, and we really believe we will be able to do so.

", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "A couple quick just data points, I think you mentioned that there's $325 million of cash at the parent company.  Was that at June 30th?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes.", "", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "And is that assuming that the August debt maturity is repaid or will that fall by the 99 million when you repay that debt?", "Gary Coleman", "", "The 325 is after the payment of the August maturity.  ", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach ", "", "Does that 325 include the dividends up from the subsidiaries for the balance of the year?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, it does.  It's on hand today, we've got $343 million, but we're going to have to use $100 million of that to pay that August maturity.  So take 200 out of that leaves $143 million and we got another $81 million coming in free cash flow for the remainder of the year.  And that gets to the $325 that we said we'd have available for the rest of the year.", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "Is the $80 million or the $81 million that you mentioned of free cash flow for the remainder of the year, that seems low relative to your typical target for free cash flow if I annualized it.  Is that just because there's an assumption for investment losses in there or\u2026?", "", "Gary Coleman", "", "No, there's not.  The cash flow is weighted toward the first part of the year.  We said coming into the year\u2026", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "Okay, got it.  So that's not necessarily earnings based, got it.", "Gary Coleman", "", "No, it's 2008 statutory earnings.  ", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "Then just to come back to risk-based capital for a moment.  I understand your comments and the rating agency is moving seemingly unendingly the bar for everybody, including Torchmark.  But just hoping we can maybe level set just a little bit, I guess you don't calculate it necessarily formally each quarter, but could you give us a sense where you were at June 30 understanding that there was still substantial cash sitting at the holding company that could be pushed down if you so desired.", "Gary Coleman", "", "John, I really can't tell you where we'd be at June 30, we don't calculate it quarterly, but I will say this that, even though we haven't calculated quarterly, I expected going back in the past that June 30 has always been much lower or essentially mostly be a lower RBC than we end the year with.  The reason being is that 75% of the dividends go out of the companies in the first six months of the year when less than half of the earnings have come in.  So even forgetting about any kind of a loss\u2026", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach ", "", "There's the mismatch on capital.", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, there was a mismatch there and so it almost has to be under 300%.", "John Nadel \u2013 Stern, Agee & Leach", "", "Then if I think about it just one last one is the impairments or OTTI that you've taken or OTTI and realized investment losses that you've taking year-to-date.  Have the amounts been consistent on both a GAAP and [STAT] basis, or has one been treated differently than another?", "Gary Coleman", "", "No, the same for GAAP and [STAT].  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Finkelstein - FPK.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "I wanted to ask one further question on the health business.  I think you delineated between worksite and individual in the underage market, if I caught that correctly.  And I guess what I'm curious about is what are the relative premium levels between those because I think you said that the worksite should be more stable in the individual health or the individual site sounds like it's almost going to zero over time.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Mark, we've can get you details of that, but I just don't have an accurate breakdown by line of business in front of me this morning, but if you'll call Mike Majors after this call, we'll be happy to give you a breakdown on that.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "", "But I mean just to clarify, is it true to say that the worksite you're seeing stability in whereas the individual site is really what the major tail off is occurring.  ", "", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, the worksite has been very stable, yes.  And now, if I go to Liberty National, their total sale is 45% is coming from worksite, so it's a significant block of sales at Liberty National.  But I wouldn't lump all individual health sales into the same boat.  It's the underage 65 primary coverage products, which has been the bulk of our sales for the last seven or eight years.  ", "We've always had some truly supplemental products, cancer, some specified disease products, and some accident products and just some hospital indemnity type products that the persistency on and profitability on those products have always been good and we will continue to offer those products at American Income and Liberty National.  ", "But the primary coverage where it is people's primary health insurance, that is being targeted by the Obama administration and both Democrats and Republicans are saying that is a bad marketplace.  That you've got a guarantee issue can't exclude any preexisting conditions.  I do believe that they will raise loss ratio requirements and it's a market that we do not intend to be in and I think its going to come down to eliminating the agent from any individ8ual health insurance sales, at least primary coverage.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Just a quick investment question, on the CDO portfolio it looks like you took $20 million of hit looking at the change in the insurance cost basis, are the remaining $89 million, are they all still fully cash flowing as of today?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, Mark, they are and of those, there's three left that we haven't impaired and two of the three look very solid, one of them we've still got a margin there and that's one there could be developments later on, but right now we've got an adequate margin there.  The other two, we're in very good shape.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "What's the value of the one that you said could have some issues down the road?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, the value of it is $50 million, but when I say there could be an issue, I don't think there's an issue collecting principle, there could be an issue down the road as to whether we collect all the interest.  If that happens, if the collateral is not sufficient to collect all the interest, we would have an impairment but it wouldn't be a sizeable impairment, as if we were not going to be able to get all the principle.  But I want to emphasize where we stand today, the latest collateral information we have, we still have a margin there.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Just a follow-up on Gary's stress scenario with the RBC, in the instance where there'd be one times the rating stress in the second half that we saw in the first half and then you had to put $350 million down, what would be the required capital level at year-end that would get you into that 300% RBC?", "Gary Coleman", "It'd be about $1.2 billion.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "What, $1.2 billion in the denominator?", "Gary Coleman", "No.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about what capital would we have to be.", "Mark McAndrew", "The required capital would be a third of that.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Mark's right.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "I got one other numbers, so I guess the enumerator at one point is that we'll go back on.  Then, Gary, you also made some comments about commercial paper just kind of, maybe you could manage to a lower level.  I guess my question would be what would that level be in the stress scenario?  To put it another way, how much CP could you do without and still manage in the stress scenario to the 300%?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Well, we're at $238 million right now.  At the $350 million, we might have to move that up to $250 million in commercial paper, if we had to put $350 million down in the insurance companies, but again that's under, we don't expect that situation to happen.  I'm not sure, does that answer your question or...", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Well, it does.  I'm just trying to get an idea.  I mean maybe the broader question is there any kind of near-term plan to reduce the amount of CP that's outstanding and that continues to get issued?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think you'll see us probably reduce the commercial paper somewhat.  Now, we'll always maintain a commercial paper program and, in my mind, that means we've got have at least $75 million to $100 million out or you lose interest at the dealers.  ", "Mark McAndrew", "And at least until we get our existing cash fully invested, it's kind of silly to continue to draw on commercial paper, but as Gary mentioned, right now commercial paper is only costing us 90 basis points.  So once we feel like we're fully invested in the cash we have on hand, it's still a very low cost of financing day-to-day operations versus sitting on a bunch of cash.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "The $325 million of available cash, that is before the bank line and any other inter-company source is that correct?", "Gary Coleman", "That's correct.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "", "I'm going to microscope the cash position just to make sure I got the numbers right.  Cash in short-term, I think you said was $968 million at the end of the quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "And you've moved $213 million down into bonds from that it in the third quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, that's correct.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "What's your target cash position at year-end where you'd like to be?", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, I think it'd be around $100 million and we don't, it's not that we're targeting $100 million, but there's always a little bit of a lag in terms of cash coming in and when we get it invested, so it would be somewhere in that neighborhood.", "Mark McAndrew", "Historically, Bob, our target has been basically to not hold cash and that's what we've used commercial paper for is to manage our short-term cash fluctuations.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So you got at least $600 million plus the generating free cash flow in the second half to get invested at 7% that's yielding less than 1% now?  What are you yielding on the cash?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, right now we're getting about 6.5%.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "On cash?", "Gary Coleman", "No, not on our cash, on our investments and so we're...", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "No, I was asking about, I'm trying to get the leverage in investment income.", "Gary Coleman", "As far as on the cash, it's about 15 to 20 basis points.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So we've got a 650 basis points pick up on $700 million that you're sort of annualized that you're under-earning right now?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, now remember $100 million will be going to pay off debt here in August.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "But you have free cash flow, too, so that should offset that.  Just sort of how much are you under-earning currently trying to figure out investment income is clearly depressed, but having nearly $1 billion earning 15 basis points, and you can get a lot of that toward 7% yields before too long, you think, before the year-end?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, again, as Mark mentioned, the $700 million but take of $100 million for that August maturity, that's $600 million and it's going to take us for sure through the third quarter and midway through October, probably, to get all that money invested.  In addition, the insurance companies have cash flow coming in that will be invested, so we think in the last half of the year we're going to be investing about $1.3 billion.", "But of the $600 million, you're right, right now we're earning the 15 to 20 basis points.  As we get that invested, we will pick up the additional that you were talking about but it will be spread over the next quarter and a half.", "", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So it looks like $0.25 to $0.30 annualized sort of run rate compression from just excessive cash, just ballpark in the numbers.  In American Income, I mean you're getting, if the sales double in the next two to three years, if you're achieving your optimistic outlook there, can we look for your overall underwriting margins in life to widen because you're growing in your highest margin business?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, that would be a fair assumption that American Income having the highest margin, if it becomes a larger and larger piece of the total that it would bring the overall up.  But Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income, will shoot me for if I let you get by with saying we'll double it two years.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So, two or three years.", "Mark McAndrew", "I think his goal is to double it in five, which is I think is very doable and I think it might actually be a little before that, but his official goal is to double it in five years.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "But you've got 36% growth in the agents so this is your lag between new hires being productive and didn't you say you were sort of rolling out some new products, too, that...", "Mark McAndrew", "We will, although that's going to be over the next six to nine months.  Again, yes, we are.  Here in the third quarter we'll be introducing a new sales presentation that's on a laptop computer with some new term products, but we're going to be very careful about introducing that.", "Again, some of the quality problems at Liberty National coincided with that change because the agents stopped collecting initial premiums when we went to the electronic app.  We're going to be very slow to put that out because we want to make sure that it adds to our marketing efforts and doesn't cause problems.  So I guess I will be a little less optimistic there because we are going to take our time in introducing that, but that will start in the third quarter.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Does a 33% sequential growth in book value have any impact on rating agencies discussions or is it just strictly RBC calculations and seeing the market sort of come back and flow have any impact on the world?", "Mark McAndrew", "I guess my answer to that, I'll let Gary answer too, but my answer, Bob, I think the rating agencies have become very quick to downgrade, but I think they'll be much slower to upgrade.  One would think, if our book value gained that much in a quarter that you might start to see that, but I think it's going to take some time.", "Even when I look at some of our below investment grade bonds, we're seeing the market values of those bonds double and more, but yet the ratings are not being upgraded.  I think the rating agencies are going to be slow to upgrade.  They're going to have to see an extended period of time improvement before we start seeing any significant upgrades.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "It probably does impact your commercial paper costs and how the banks view you, I would think, on how they lend.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think we were issuing a lot of that paper before they saw the fact that their unrealized losses had improved so much, and probably everybody expected that.  But, yes, I think it probably helps a little bit.  With the rating agencies, it does help.  That's one of the things that's on their radar.  But also they're looking at possible future impairments.  They should know better than anybody about the future downgrades.  So I agree with Mark.  They probably view this as positive development, but I don't see them making a change for a while.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just wanted to come back to the comment on the health insurance side about the under age 65 primary coverage business.  Mark, I think you had mentioned that's been the bulk of your health sales over the last six or seven years?", "Mark McAndrew", "At United American, that's true.  Yes.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "If you can give me rough estimates that'd be great, but if I look at your total annualized in force health premium of $800 million plus, I think the comment earlier was $400 million or so was med supp.  Should I assume most of the remaining $400 million plus would be this type of product?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, it's not that much because, again, you can take the business at Liberty National and at American Income.  There's significant blocks of business there that are not that product.  We can get a better breakdown.  We can provide a better breakdown.  Anyone who would like to see by product line what our in- force looks like, we'll be happy to put that together.  I just don't have it here in front of me.  ", "But now it would be, if you looked at what was the United American block of business, that's where all that business is.  Most of the Liberty National is truly supplemental products, cancers, specific disease, hospital income type products that are sole payroll deduction.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Yes.  I would say that product was a significant part of the sales.  But it also, particularly the one that we've sold since 2005, also had much higher lapse rate than what we anticipated.  So that's the one that was really also falling off the books.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So if I look at the, just looking at your supplement, United American total I believe this is health insurance premium collected year-to-date $185 million.  It's going to be that large part of that number, but that's six months, obviously.  So that would be the right number to look at for that product?", "Mark McAndrew", "It really will be.  If you would like an accurate breakdown of the in force, rather than speculate on or approximate what those numbers are, we can provide as of June 30 a breakdown between the different product lines.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Yes, because there's differences in how much med supp business is in either line, too.  So I just want to make sure that I'm talking about the right\u2026", "Mark McAndrew", "Again, anyone who would like that information, by all means, call Mike Majors.", "Gary Coleman", "Mark, we can put it on the website.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I think that would be very helpful just because if we're really looking at a runoff of that block, it would be good to know \u2013", "Mark McAndrew", "We'll put that on our website and we'll get some historical numbers, too.  So you can better estimate the trends.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "There will be difference in how it runs off depending on what's in there, yes, definitely.", "Mark McAndrew", "We'll try to do that here this week.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That would be great.  Is there a meaningful difference in margins of that business or is it roughly the same as the other health products?", "Mark McAndrew", "That health product has the lowest margin of any of our health products.  It has much lower margins than Medicare supplement or any of the worksite products, or any of the cancer or specified disease products.  You want to comment, Rosemary?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Yes, I do.  It has lower margins because of the persistency differences.  So that's really the summary of that.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So that would have been associated, I assume, with an acceleration of [DAC], but not so much on the loss ratio side just on the acquisition cost.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Well, it'll impact both.  If you have increased lapses on a health product, it will impact both the loss ratio and the amortization, but they don't offset.  So all in all, you're still going to have a negative to your profit because it's going to impact [DAC] more than it's going to actually serve.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.  So the higher the lapse rates the more selection you see, as far as on the claims side.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Mark, would you say beyond that specific product Obama healthcare reform isn't having a meaningful impact on the remaining health insurance?", "Mark McAndrew", "When I look at the legislation that's out there and just what they're defining as health insurance, it does not include our other products.  It has no impact on Medicare supplement or the truly supplemental products that are being sold in the workplace.  No, we don't believe that it will have any impact on those products.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Last question, the comment that I think Gary made about considering buying some of the high yield life sub, would you own that at the holding company or what exactly are you contemplating there?", "Gary Coleman", "What we would do, Tom, is buy the bonds out of the insurance company and we would buy them at amortized cost.  There would be no gain or loss to the insurance company, and then we would hold that asset, those bonds, at the holding company.", "Mark McAndrew", "That will help our RBC, but it will also increase the statutory earnings that we would have available to dividend out next year.", "Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So it would be sort of swapping cash with high yield bonds. ", "Gary Coleman", "What we would do is we would put cash in and invest those in securities that are higher rated above the categories that where you have the high risk charges.  Either that or we would invest that money at the holding company and then put those bonds down into the insurance companies.  We could do it either way.", "Mark McAndrew", "Because it comes down to, we still believe that the vast majority of our below investment grade holdings are money good.  In fact, we currently believe they're all money good.  And I know we were asked last quarter should we not be selling some of those off to improve the portfolio, and that's interesting.  That's something we looked at prior to the call was that the bonds that were below investment grade at the end of March, we've had gains of $150 million for the quarter.  ", "But even within that group, the financials, our holdings there, it would have been a very bad decision to have sold off a significant number of those bonds.  In fact, it's interesting, you can look at I use Bank of America as a classic example, at the end of March, we had a $39 million unrealized loss in Bank of America bonds.  They were rated BB+.  ", "At the end of June, they were rated BB, which they received another downgrade, but yet our unrealized loss went from $39 million down to $14 million in three months.  So we still believe that the vast majority of these bonds will not default and we tend to hold them, but we think it would definitely help our RBC to hold them at the parent instead of at the insurance subs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "I wanted to ask a couple of questions about how the economy might or might not be impacting your business and kind of how it might impact going forward.  First of all on direct response, obviously advertising demand is way down very soft media market.  Is that translating into any lower media costs for in the direct response business?", "And then my other question has to do with agents recruiting.  You've had this tremendous momentum to go to American Income, but it has been in the context of a soft economy and rising unemployment.  You seem pretty confident about maintaining recruiting momentum going forward.  But I'm just wondering if we should maybe temper that confidence a little bit with the idea that as unemployment comes down at some point, that recruiting will be a little tougher. ", "Mark McAndrew", "Well first on direct response, again, if you look at what the markets were in and the direct mail side of our business, which is roughly 45% of our sales there, there's no change.  In fact, other than postage increases, the costs can go up.  But there's really no, the economy does not result in savings other than we might be able to buy paper at a little lower cost because we do everything in-house.  We do all of our printing and manufacturing and envelopes.  ", "But on the insert media side, which is the balance of that, and segments sure, we've seen some costs come down.  We've been able to negotiate some better rates.  When I look at the $15 million to $20 million of savings that we're going to see or the reduced acquisition cost, we're really not assuming anything as far as a lower cost per piece distributed.  It's really just cutting back on some of the marginal volume that we've been doing.  Now if I can recall, what was the second part of your question?", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Whether the relationship between the soft economy, rising unemployment, and agent recruiting and how that dynamic might change going forward.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, there's no doubt that there's more resumes out on these Internet sites, but we never had a shortage of people to recruit.  If unemployment goes back down in the 5% to 6% range, which I don't think that's going to happen in the short-term, it could have some impact.  But there's still no reason why we can't grow our agency force double digits indefinitely regardless of the unemployment rate.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Mark, I don't think there was a comment about why the reduction in EPS guidance.  I was just wondering if you could focus us on marginally what changed in your view from 1Q to 2Q, or was that more just a reflection of the high cost of the debt issued during the quarter.", "Mark McAndrew", "That's the single biggest thing, John, was three months ago we did not anticipate borrowing $300 million at 9.25%.  We knew we had to cover $100 million, but if we had gone with a two-year credit line, the cost of that was only going to be I think it was less than 5%l, and we ended up borrowing $300 million at 9.25%.  So we did not anticipate that three months ago, and that additional debt cost is really the biggest difference.  You want to comment, Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "The only other thing, John, I would add is that the holding the extra cash we think that is about $4 million less investment income that we're going to have than we thought we would back at the end of March  Those two are the biggest items.  ", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Then the last one I wanted to follow-up on, Gary, in response I think it was to Randy's question earlier, about the stress case that you walked us through in your prepared remarks I think it was impairments at 1.5 times the level from the first half in the second half?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "And then I don't recall the stress that you put on the below investment grade.  Was it increase at the same pace that it did in the first half?", "Gary Coleman", "That the downgrades in terms of the effect on capital would be as great in the second half as it was in the first half, although, in the second quarter, the effect was about half of what it was in the first quarter, we went ahead and assumed the full six month downgrade in the second six months.", "Mark McAndrew", "Gary, is it safe to say that the downgrades have more of an impact on the RBC than the impairments at this point because most of the impairments are coming from the below investment grade.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, to a certain extent some of those impairments are coming from bonds that are already impaired, that are already not admitted for statutory purposes.  So, yes, the downgrades would have a little more impact.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Bonds that are not admitted or just already have such a high risk charge?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, once they get through there's percentages of Class 6 assets, there's percentages of Class 5 and 6, there's a percentage of Class 4, 5 and 6.  If you exceed those percentages, then you have to not admit the excess.  ", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Have you crossed over that threshold yet or does the stress case?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, we have just slightly as of June, but my point is, is that once you go past that, then really the impairments are \u2013 now you could have impairments come from bonds that haven't been non-admitted, and that would have a direct impact.  But if it comes from the lower classes, some portion of those may already be non-admitted.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "So then in sort of direct follow-up to your response to Randy, I think, Gary, you mentioned that the denominator under that scenario would be around $400 million.", "Gary Coleman", "John, it's $445 million.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach", "I was going to say that because your denominator was 370 or thereabouts at year-end '08 it didn't seem like that was enough of a move.  ", "Operator", "There are no questions in the queue.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.  ", "Mark McAndrew", "Well those are our comments for this morning.

Please note this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast.", "At this time I will turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead Sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Hutchison our General Counsel, Rosemary Montgomery our Chief Actuary and Mike Majors Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of my comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly please refer to our 2008 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the quarter was $122 million or $1.48 per share, a per share decrease of 2% from a year-ago. Net income was $101 million or $1.22 per share. Excluding FAS 115 our return on equity was 14.6% and our book value per share was $42.82, a 13% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity, investment period of market value, book value was $39.92 per share.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 2% to $414 million and life under writing margins increased 3% to $111 million. Life insurance net sales were $82 million up 9% from a year ago.", "At American Income life premiums were up 6% to $128 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $43 million. Net life sales increased 14% to $32 million. Producing agents at American Income grew to 3,929 up 36% from a year ago.", "Due to first three quarters of this year life sales at American Income have grown 16%. I believe it\u2019s on a very good growth track and has good momentum and we expect to see similar sales growth to continue throughout 2010.", "In our Direct Response operation life premiums were up 5% to $133 million and life underwriting margin grew 12% to $33 million. Net life sales increased 10% to $33 million. Sales results in Direct Response were somewhat better than expected through nine months our Direct Response life sales are up 10% while achieving a $15 million reduction in our acquisition expenses.", "We currently expect to see comparable sales growth for 2010 while keeping our expense level close to the 2009 level.", "Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $75 million and life underwriting margin was down 23% to $14 million. Net life sales for the Liberty National offices declined 12% to $11.4 million. And the producing agent count down to 2693. Net life sales for UA Branch Offices grew 84% to $2.7 million for the quarter.", "Significant changes were made during the third quarter to address the persistency and profitability of the business being written at Liberty National. These changes have improved the quality of the new business but we anticipate a continued decline in our sales and producing agent count during the fourth quarter.", "We expect this decline to reverse in the first quarter of 2010 and expect to achieve double-digit growth in life sales at Liberty National during 2010.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 13% to $200 million and health underwriting margin was down 15% to $36 million. Health net sales declined 39% to $18 million.", "We believe the level of our health sales is close to bottoming out and currently expect 2010 health sales of around $70 million. With the announced dis-enrollments of over 600,000 Medicare advantage participants, we expect to see an improvement on our new Medicare supplement sales as well as Part D, although it is too early to predict how much improvement we'll see.", "Premium revenue from Medicare Part D was $48 million for the quarter, a 15% increase, while underwriting margin declined 11% to $6 million. Through nine months Part D sales have grown 29% to $16 million. The underwriting margin from our annuity business was $1.2 million for the quarter versus $300,000 a year ago.", "Administrative expenses were $37.4 million for the quarter down 2%. Year-to-date our administrative expenses are up less than 1%. For 2010 we anticipate administrative expenses to grow in the 1 to 2% range.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital.", "First, there are several positive developments in the third quarter, net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio are $396 million, a decline of $1.8 billion from the peak of the $2.2 billion at March 31st, 2009, and the lowest level since year-end 2007.", "In addition, we improved the overall quality of the bond portfolio by reducing below investment grade bonds by 23% to $946 million, and we bolster the capital to insurance companies by contributing a $125 million of cash from a parent company to the subs. The first two items the reduction of the unrealized losses and the reduction of below investment grade bonds are interrelated.", "In previous quarters we chose not to sell below investment grade bonds because we generally buy and hold and any under valuations were such that we felt that we would receive a better risk adjusted return by holding them.", "Due to the significant improvement in valuations in the third quarter, we determined that for certain below investment grade bonds we would get a better risk adjusted return by selling them. Thus late in the quarter we sold $315 million of below investment grade bonds. To offset the tax losses from these sales, we sold $443 million of investment grade in NAIC Class 2 bonds. Because the sales occurred so late in September, very little of the proceeds were reinvested as of September 30th.", "On the balance sheet, these proceeds are included in cash, short-term investments, and receivables from the sale of securities. We are currently in the process of investing these funds in investment grade securities.", "I will include the impact of this portfolio repositioning in my comments on the investment portfolio liquidity and capital. First, the investment portfolio on our website are three schedules that provide some information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2009. They're included under supplemental financial information in the financial reports and other financial information sections of the Investor Relations page.", "As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $10.1 billion including $9.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs combined equities, mortgage loans and real estate are $33 million less than 1% of invested assets. As the $9.4 million of fixed maturities $8.5 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus.", "The low investment grade bonds are $946 million, and once all of the sales proceeds from the portfolio repositioning are invested will be 9% of fixed maturities. This compares to the $1.2 billion of below investment grade bonds and 13.1% of fixed maturities at June 30, 2009.", "In addition, the ratio of below investment grade assets to equity excluding FAS 115, is 27% compared to 36% at June 30.", "Overall the total portfolio is rated triple B plus the same as a year ago. During the quarter we charged realized capital losses for other than temporary impairments on five bonds. The total charge was $51 million pre-tax or $31 million after tax. Including the net gains on asset sales net realized capital losses for the quarter were $25 million dollars after tax.", "Year-to-date realized capital losses of $78 million after tax, for further information regarding impairments see the schedule on our website entitled summary of net realized investment losses.", "Now I would like to discuss the asset types within our fixed maturity portfolio. 75% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 15% is in redeemable preferred stocks. All of the $1.4 billion are redeemable preferreds have a stated maturity debt and other characteristics that make them look like debt securities. And to date all scheduled interest payments have been received. None of these securities are perpetual preferreds. The remaining 10% of the portfolio consists primarily of municipals and government related securities.", "Our CDO exposure is down to $61 million and two securities were the underlying collateral is primary bank and insurance company trust preferreds.", "Now to conclude the discussion with investments, I\u2019ll cover the investment yield. At June 30, 2009, we had $625 million of cash in short-term investments in the insurance companies. We had accumulated the cash in the second quarter because of the uncertainty regarding the commercial paper and long-term debt markets. With the $300 million of debt issuance in June and stabilization of CP market, we invested this excess cash in the third quarter along with our operating cash flow.", "In the third quarter we invested $957 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual affective yield of 6.4%, an average rating of A, at an average life of 13 to 19 years.", "This compares to the 7.3% yield, A minus rating and 21 year average life of the bonds acquired in the first six months of 2009. The lower third quarter yield was due to us relax in the tenure of our investments in order to have a larger supply of bonds to invest in.", "Although we invested the excess cash from June 30, we ended the third quarter with excess cash due primarily to the portfolio repositioning. At September 30th we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, short-term investments and receivables from sale of securities. $940 million in the insurance companies and the remaining $150 million in the parent company.", "We are in the process of investing the extra cash to insurance companies but will probably not have it all invested by year-end because of the already limited supply of bonds currently available, and the usual slow-down in the approaching holiday season.", "Since September 30th, we have invested $282 million at an average yield of around 6%, average life of 14 to 22 years, and an average rating of A.", "For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.97%, the same as it has been for the last eight quarters. However, the portfolio repositioning in late September has reduced the portfolio yield, because the $758 million of bonds sold, had an average yield of 7.23%. As a result, the overall yield on the portfolio is now about 6.88%. And once the excess cash is invested, we expect the portfolio yield to be around 6.85%.", "Now, regarding risk based capital, as previously indicated we intend to maintain our RBC ratio at around 300% level that we've held in the past. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but it is sufficient for our companies, in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Entering 2009, our consolidated RBC ratio was 329%, by June 30th the ratio had fallen to 245% due to bond impairments and down grades and disproportionate share of dividends to the parent company during the first half of the year. In the third quarter we took step to improve the RBC ratio.", "We increased the capital insurance companies, by having a parent company contribute to $125 million of cash, and that committed to contribute another $50 million in the fourth quarter. We reduced required capital by approximately $27 million by selling below investment grade bonds as a part of the portfolio repositioning. Additional benefit of the repositioning is that our class 3 through 6 bonds are well below the regulatory limitation both in total and by individual class.", "With these enhancements and assuming no impairments or down grades in the fourth quarter, we estimate that the year end RBC to be around 313%, which means that we would have approximately $55 million of capital over that is required for 300% ratio. We performed a stress test assuming the following in the fourth quarter. Impairments of $30 million after tax, and assumed down grades on our bonds that are O-negative watch and outlook that result in down grades equal to the quarterly average during the first six months of the year. Even though down grades in the third quarter had an immaterial impact on the required capital.", "Under this severe scenario, RBC would be approximately 290% and we would need to put in additional $50 million into the insurance companies to reach the 300% level. We don't expect to have this level of realized losses and downgrades in the fourth quarter, but if we did, we have more than sufficient liquidity at the holding company to maintain the 300% ratio.", "At September 30th, the parent company had $150 million of cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter will add another $50 million. But as mentioned the parent will use $50 million to purchase surplus notes from the insurance companies in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect parent company cash to remain at $150 million at year-end. In addition, we estimate that free cash flow for 2010 will add another $210 million to $230 million to parent company cash. In addition to the cash of the parent company, we have other sources of liquidity, such as debt issuance and credit facilities and inter-company financing that could provide another $1.2 billion of cash.", "So based on the results of our stress testing, the cash held at the parent company, and other liquidity sources, we believe the parent company has more than sufficient liquidity to offset the impact of further realized losses and down grades on the statutory capital of our insurance companies.", "Those are my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. As a result of bond sales in the third quarter, which Gary mentioned we are revising our guidance for 2009 to a range of $5.90 to $5.95 per share. For 2010, we currently anticipate operating earnings per share to be between $6.05 and $6.25, assuming we do not reinstate any share repurchase.", "Those are my comments for this morning. I will now open it up for questions. David?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thanks. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Good afternoon, everyone. You guys are good poker players, you never sound excited or nervous, but the body language I assume is that you feel lot better about your capital position 6/30, given the financial markets in the third quarter. Is that a fair assessment?", "Mark McAndrew", "I think that's a fair assessment and versus where we were six months ago when our unrealized losses come down $1.8 billion, we have to feel pretty good about that.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. You throw the share repurchase as you're ignoring it which sort of means that you think it's at least theoretical possibility in 2010. What are the benchmarks that we should be looking for that would make you feel comfortable to resume your share repurchase program?", "To put it another way, if you execute your plan and impairments are downgrade and are in line with what you're thinking, what is the soonest you could consider buying back stock?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, we're not in a position to make any commitment there, yet, Bob. It is something that we'll continue to monitor each quarter and discuss at our Board meetings, but it is a little premature to try to set a date. Obviously things that will impact it will be what future impairments and downgrades are, although, we believe the worst of that is over, and other potential uses for the cash. So, I just can't predict right now when that might occur.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Direct Response coming in above where you thought it was, is that anything related to the economy not being as bad as you feared, or something from an execution point of view?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, it's a little bit of both. Actually we started to see some of our response rates increase which I think has a little something to do with the economy. That was the only segment that we felt like the economy had some impact on. But overall a number of the tests that we performed earlier in the year, we were able to roll out with, and the results have been good, and I'm very optimistic about where we're headed next year.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We go next to the line of Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, you touched a little bit on some of the things at Liberty, but I guess I didn\u2019t quite come away with an understanding of what's happening there in terms of why you're still challenged and what sort of compensation and other changes you made there. So could you kind of give us a little \u2013?", "Mark McAndrew", "Sure. Well, as I mentioned last quarter, we saw some significant deterioration in the persistency of the new business being written over Liberty National over the last year. And they're very closely tied into when we went to electronic application and laptop sales presentation. Part of the problem there was, as we went to the electronic application, we no longer required the agent to collect the initial premium on these sales. We didn't have adequate controls in place to really guarantee the quality of the business we were writing.", "So we have made some changes, and we've tied management's compensation more closely to the overall persistency of the business being written. We've delayed paying agents until after that first premium payment clears the bank, and so that we know we have a good bank account, there is money in the account. So we've made some changes. We anticipated when we made though, that some of the agents and some of the managers who had quality issues that were below our standard, that we would see some turnover there and we have.", "Again, it was planned on, and we'll continue to see a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, but we think we've made the changes necessary to improve the profitability of the business, and we believe by the first quarter of next year we will be in a position to start seeing some good growth there again.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay. That's helpful. And next for Gary. Gary, you give us a lot of information around things sort of impacting portfolio yield. I guess the answer to my question maybe embedded in what you already given us but maybe you can help me out.", "If you want to think specifically about the kind of the cost of the portfolio repositioning, either in terms of yield or dollars, can you isolate what the cost of that expected to be essentially?", "Gary Coleman", "Our portfolio yield has been or last several quarters 6/97, and now just snapshot of the portfolio as it is, it is down around 688. So it costs us 10, 11 basis points.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, Gary, as Mark said , it is hard to know when you get back to share repurchase mode, but when you kind of clear the credit crisis a little further and kind of get back in that mode. Are you likely to kind of get back to the fairly straightforward way that you kind of managed capital and cash flow historically? Historically, you pretty much pulled the regular dividend, serviced the holding company and bought back stock and it was pretty straightforward.", "Are you likely at some point to kind of get back to that kind of technique, or are you likely to need to kind of manage holding company a little differently going forward based on what we've experienced in this cycle?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Jeff, we want to make efficient use of our excess cash. Although, it is something that we're more open now to looking at potential acquisitions, and as a credit markets continue to improve and open up, that's a possible use for that excess cash, too. So, it's really impossible to say right at this point just how we'll use our excess cash next year, but we will try to use it as efficiently as possible.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "I guess part of my question was about the holding company, historically, you didn't carry a lot of cash at the holding company. As we get beyond this crisis, can you get back to that mode, or out of prudence will you carry a different level that going forward?", "Gary Coleman", "Jeff, one difference for the \u2013 I think we can get back to that, maybe we leave a little more cushion there, although, we came into the year at 329% RBC. We'll be a little more careful from that standpoint. I think one difference you may see is that the cash may not come up to the holding company as quickly. We may \u2013 in the past we never managed RBC ratios at particular quarters and that's become more of an issue.", "You may see more of a spreading of the cash out over the year as opposed to bringing it out in the first half than second half.", "Gary Coleman", "Jeff, short-term, as far as 2010, I will have to say we will be a little more prudent as far as holding some cushion at the holding company level.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Great. Okay. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed Spehar with Banc of America.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Thank you, good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on free cash flow for 2010, Gary, I think you said 210 to 230, which is a lower number than what I would think is a normal free cash flow numbers. So can you explain that a little bit more? Does part of that reflect holding more of a cushion at the holding company or what's going on there?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, part of it is, again from this year's earnings and the impairments that we had this year are holding down the earnings for this year. And that's \u2013 and also the new business, increased new business, where Liberty is going to hold their earnings down a little bit. But we will hold a little extra cash. We're just not sure how much. That's why I'm giving you a range.", "And it's really kind of early to give a range because I haven't even seen our third quarter numbers. So, I try to be conservative with that. We'll have a better idea of free cash flow when we get into the fourth quarter. But the single biggest factor Ed, was the impairments we had during the year.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Can I follow up on that? Because there seems to be some \u2013 it seems unusual to hear about statutory dividend capability capacity being limited by impairment s because I think statutory dividends are a function of prior-year operating gain or 10% of surplus and it's either greater-than or less-than when you look at the state. So why \u2013 and there is some confusion about this net earnings limitation which I'm not sure, I mean there is different opinions on this sort of related to Nebraska regulation. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more on that.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Nebraska standpoint, it was different than say, Delaware, Nebraska requires \u2013 you take your operating earnings less any loss, if you have losses you have to reduce the losses on it, and that's different.", "In Delaware it is operating earnings and in Nebraska it is operating earnings and if you had realized losses you have to deduct that.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. And then I guess the \u2013 maybe I'll follow up with you on that because I want to talk a little bit more about the specifics, because it seems like \u2013 it is unclear to me that that's the approach that makes sense given that you're a life company. I know there is some controversy about this Nebraska wording. But I wanted to ask you about the guidance for 2010, and I'm sorry if I missed this.", "But the wider range, little bit wider range, is it because we're early on here or is it specifically related to sort of uncertainty about how quickly you reinvest cash or share buyback I don't think is included in that number. But can you give us a little bit about maybe in terms of why the range is wide?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that is typically what we've done in the last couple of years, anyway, Ed, we started out the year with a little wider range and then we narrow it as the year goes along. Although, there is still some uncertainty there, and I would have to say there is some conservatism built in there, as far as particularly on both the investment income side as well as underwriting margin side.", "But Gary, you can on the investment side, we've assumed that we're basically investing funds at 6% for the entire year.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Yes, that's correct.", "Mark McAndrew", "But it's kind of a normal \u2013 this is typical of what we've done in the last couple of years, Ed.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with FPK Research.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "Hi, couple of quick sessions here. I guess, firstly, why the rationale of issuing a surplus note rather than just doing what you're doing with 125 and just putting another 50 in the stack company?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think it gives us a little more flexibility. Also it helps us from the tax standpoint. It generates \u2013 we need non-insurance company income, and so, the sales from that standpoint it's \u2013 and it gives a little flexibility in terms of, that money could be paid back at certain points in time.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "Okay. And I guess just thinking about 2010 and even beyond 2010 into 2011, I mean obviously the primary health block is in essentially in run-off. The in force is down to 129. How much do you estimate the earnings impact from that business essentially from here going to zero in terms of whether it is operating earnings or EPS, or what have you?", "Gary Coleman", "Mark, I guess that is another way you can look that is the in force on the hospital/surgical block is down to 129 million and Rosemary, our profit margin on that business\u2026", "Rosemary Montgomery", "The underwriting margin on that business is probably around, I would say around 6%, 7%, and based on, assuming that there is no further persistence deterioration, we would expect that to hold.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "And that is pretax.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Yes", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "So, you can kind of see the potential impact there that\u2019s in run-off mode.", "Gary Coleman", "Again, that's 16% of our total health enforced premium. One of the things on the Medicare supplement side, that\u2019s still, we saw 457 million Medicare premiums on the books which is 55% of our total and it declined by just over 1% in the quarter. And I think with the Medicare advantage disenrollments and the potential for there is going to be two new standardized Medicare supplements plans coming up next year. I'm cautiously optimistic that we can start seeing some growth in the Medicare supplement side.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "Okay. I guess, just one final question on the run-off of the primary health block. I mean, is it 6% to 7% goes to zero and no additional overhead expenses go to the other businesses, therefore the margin on the other businesses get hit because of a lower premium margin or can it literally go to zero and literally no changes in the margins Med sup and the other health businesses?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Are you asking if they're independent? Because I think I would say the answer is yes. But if that block entirely runs off then I would expect the Medicare supplement profits that we're still seeing would hold.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "Right. Okay. And then just one final question on capital. I understand you're going to kind of hold to a more normalized RBC throughout the year. But is that number going to call it 300% or are you going to target at little above that as a stack company?", "Gary Coleman", "I think the proprietary it maybe \u2013 we have a little bit of a cushion there. It is going close \u2013 we're not going to go up to 400%, closer to 300%, but we'll try to maintain a cushion.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "At the stack company.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Mark Finkelstein \u2013 FPK Research", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Hi, good afternoon. Mark, if we could, can we revisit the discussion with Jeff on L & L, so I understand what is going on here? The problem was you move to laptops agents no longer collected the initial premium. How are you getting initial, well, presumably you got it by hand the first time around, but how do you get it after this change, how were you suppose at the beginning of wire transfer?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I mean, for a number of years the primary payment mode has been automatic withdrawal from people's bank accounts on a monthly basis. So when we were dealing with paper applications, the customer wrote a check for the first month's premium, so we knew we had the first premium payment as well as from the check we knew we had good bank account information.", "Now, when we went to electronic application, we were drafting out of the people's bank account the first premium payment and a lot of it was just incorrect bank account numbers. We would have to go back and forth.", "But one, now we're making sure, a big change which is making sure that that first premium payment clears the bank before we advance commissions or pay bonuses and that had immediate impact.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Is the issue, I mean, you said wrong numbers, but is part of the issue some type of buyer's remorse, and would hand in half (inaudible) and now people pay him and then the transfer would just never be made because the purchaser had remorse.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I am sure there was some of that. It's impossible to quantify why the initial payments weren't clearing. We just know we saw a significant deterioration coincide to the time with moved to electronic application.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "You said that you've tied \u2013 you're not going to pay until the check clears I guess or until wire transfer is made and you tied the management to bonuses and pay to persistency. Any steps to make sure that that first payment comes in?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, there is too. We again now with electronic application, because it is electronic funds transfer. We're processing that within 24 hours from the time the application is transmitted to us. So we only had to delay payment for a few days. But, no, we're now making sure that if the initial payment does not clear the bank, the agent is not paid for.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Very good. If I could, you mentioned Medicare disenrollment, Was that a, I couldn't quite hear the number, was that 600,000?", "Mark McAndrew", "It's just over 600,000, I think somewhere 630,000, or somewhere in that range.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "And then maybe, Rosemary or somebody can comment on how the Part D bidding went for you guys this time around.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "The Part D bidding was fine. Our plans were approved. Our bids were accepted. We're going to generally be selling the same type of plans next year that we've had in 2009. The premium is going up a little bit by I would say approximately $3 a month.", "We also made some changes in our co-pays, but it's basically business as usual there, plus same profit margin that we have anticipated going into next year as we had for this year as we had for this year.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. In enrollment you guess it would be about the same or do you pick up some LIS maybe?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Well, we\u2019ve really picked up a real small region, Delaware, DC and...", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Okay.", "Rosemary Montgomery", "So, that will probably be about the same.", "Mark McAndrew", "Although\u2026", "Rosemary Montgomery", "That\u2019s the region we had.", "Mark McAndrew", "On the individual side, I would expect to see some improvement there, just because of the 630,000 Medicare Advantage disenrollees, some of those people have the Part D coverage with Medicare Advantage plan. So, again we know where those disenrollees are occurring, and we've already developed mail links and print ads to target those areas and so hopefully we'll pick up some of that business also.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "Okay, good point. All right, thank you guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Thanks. Just a question on investment yields. I think in a conversation here you were talking about targeting 6% new money yields in 2010 with kind of the money that needs to be reinvested. Did I hear that right?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Randy, you did. The reason we used the 6% is that's what we're \u2013 we've invested in so far this quarter. We actually think the rates may be higher than that. At least maybe toward the end of the year, but we settled on six because that is what we're investing in now.", "Mark McAndrew", "It\u2019s not so much that we're targeting 6%, Randy, it's just that we've used in our projection. We hope to beat the 6%.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "And what's the mix of assets that's generating that kind of yield on a current basis?", "Gary Coleman", "When you say mix of assets, you mean as far as \u2013", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "You know, as far as credit, investment grade corporate, high-yield corporate. Are you doing any other structured stuff?", "Gary Coleman", "No, no structured stuff. It is going to be in corporates. Investment grade corporates and we'll confine it to that. What may change is that, Randy there are fall to liabilities that are very long-term. We like to invest long because to match those [ph] liabilities. What we've seen though is, right now there is limited supply of bonds available.", "For some reason we're \u2013 we're not seeing long bonds at the yields we would like. So, for \u2013 right now we're investing a little bit shorter, and if we don't get the 6.5% of the long-term basis that we're looking for then we'll probably should shorten up a little bit, but we expect that it will get back to, again, the investment grade, corporates and generally 20 year maturities. Right now it\u2019s a little bit less than that, thus we expect to get back to that at some point.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Great. And just one more if I could. As far as thinking about how the model the overall investment yields for the company, as there's a newer piece coming in, what would you expect that to kind of have downward progression into second or third quarter of 2010, or would it be flatter? Or it just kind of some timing of when you think that the overall yield might trough would be helpful for getting to the guidance number on 2010?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, we're at \u2013 I think we'll end the year; our portfolio yield will be around 685. If we invest at six next year, we have quite a bit of money to invest, that could get down to around 670 by the end of the year. So the average would be there to beginning and the ending.", "The difference is, though, if we invest at 6.5 to 50 basis points more, you don't see that much of a decline in the yield. So it's going to \u2013 again, at 6% we would go from around 685 to 670, invest at 6.5% and then maybe 685 to 680 or a little above.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Okay. And so one more \u2013", "Gary Coleman", "Those last numbers I gave you, 670, that\u2019s what the portfolio yield would be at the end of the year, so for the year it would be the average of 685 and the 670.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Right. Got it. Just one more question. So there is a range obviously on 2010, and earlier, Mark, you said there is combination of underwriting and investment yield conservatism. But wouldn't it be mostly be investment yield conservatism between the 6 and 6.5 or better?", "Mark McAndrew", "That\u2019s a big part of it, yes.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "All right. Fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Eric Berg with Barclays Capital.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. Good morning to everybody in Texas. So you announced to the world that essentially nobody is going to get paid any longer until the check clears and that's very clear and it makes complete sense to me, but is it possible that, that alone is leading to this very significant drop in first year agents at Liberty? And then I have a follow-up? Or other factors that we need to be sensitive to?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, that\u2019s basically the change is in the compensation that we made really because of the current decline there. But, again, we expect that to be basically a run out here in the fourth quarter and turn around in the first quarter.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Question, agent count, it looks like there has been a big drop as well in the agent count at the UA Branch really continuing. Can you remind us why that is happening and what\u2019s being done to address that, if you want to \u2013 is in fact that is a problem. I shouldn't presuppose it is a problem. But what\u2019s behind that one and what\u2019s being done to correct it if in fact that's your goal?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, the cause of it is still \u2013 it's very difficult to move agents who have traditionally written health insurance into writing life insurance. And as we continue to convert more of those offices, we've continued to see a decline.", "Now, that, for example, I'll just say at the end of the second quarter, we had converted 44 of 78 UA offices to the Liberty National products and basically transitioned them to write more life and supplemental health.", "During the quarter we moved to 11 more offices over, and as we continue, we're now down to \u2013 there's only 18 UA offices that have not been converted. So we'll continue to see some drop-off there as those offices are converted to Liberty National.", "It\u2019s difficult to teach agents a new market play. So, the trick is, we've got to hire more new agents and train them how to write life insurance in the supplemental work side products. And we're continuing to push that and try to incentivize the recruitment of new agents. So that should be completed here in the next couple of quarters.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Last question, Mark, is purposely meant to be broad and I'll preface by saying that I understand that your answer to my question is going to be necessarily \u2013 will have to be heavily caveated, but realizing that there is so many changes taking place in healthcare, I would like to know, what do you think two to three years from now, whatever, look into the distance and make your best guess, what\u2019s the complexion of your health business is going to be. Is it going to be Medicare supplement business, is it going to be limited benefit business? Where is this business from the 30,000-foot level, where is this business headed? Where will it settle down three years from now in terms of its complexion?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. My feelings about where health insurance is headed is you're going to see a few large players basically take over the individual health insurance marketplace.", "I think as far as agents are concerned, I think you're going to see standardized plans with minimum benefits with significantly higher minimum loss ratios than what we see today. Those higher minimum loss ratios are going to make it very difficult for an agent to make a living selling individual health insurance, at least the broad benefit major medical type products. I think you are going to see it become more of a commodity.", "But on the bright note, I think a lot of those agents that are in that marketplace are going to be looking for a different marketplace to get into. I think right now, I think you will see a significant number of those agents move back into a Medicare supplement marketplace, with \u2013 because I think the Medicare Advantage plans, I think the 600,000 disenrollees this year is just the first of several years worth of disenrollees and with the new supplement Medicare plans coming out mid part of next year, I think there will be renewed interest in the Medicare supplement world.", "But as far as agents are concern, I don't see a long-term future in the major medical business. And I think a number of agencies who have been in that marketplace are seeing the same thing.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I guess just one clarification and then I'd like to do requeue if necessary, so that others can ask a question. Why was the high loss ratio, or higher loss ratios that you would see mandated loss ratios, can you clarify why would not make for an agent to make money, his commissions is a function of selling the policy, not how profitable it is at the company level?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, but it\u2019s driven by, for example, Eric, if we've got a 60% minimum loss ratio, that allows us 40% of the premium for profit and commission, acquisition expense. If they raise that to 90% minimum loss ratio, that only allows 10 points for profit administration, and compensation.", "Well, and it may not go to 90 but I would be surprised if it doesn't go to at least 80. You take that from 60 to 80, that basically squeezes out any compensation that's available, because the company still needs to make a profit and pay for their administrative costs.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I got it now. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.", "Mike Grondahl \u2013 Northland Securities", "Yes, Mark, can you talk little bit about your sales outlook for American Income in Direct Response as you're kind of looking at '10 and kind of the strategies you're going to employ there?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, at American Income, we feel like we've made the changes over the last two or three years necessary to really put us in a position for growth, and we have seen double-digit growth now for at least six quarters in a row.", "I feel very good about the track it's on. I don't see any major changes necessary there to continue the type of growth that we've been seeing. One, we're starting to look at trying to move \u2013 continue to move beyond just the labor union marketplace, and still writing middle income working class Americans, and we've got some people in our Direct Response operation trying to assist there to try to continue to grow that company even outside the union marketplace.", "But it\u2019s on a very good track right now, and I expect to continue to see strong double-digit growth for the foreseeable feature at American Income. The Direct Response, I am pleased with where we are at and we've had a number of tests that we have done this year on product pricing and packaging that have been very successful.", "Going into next year, we already feel pretty good about at least high single-digit if not low double-digit growth, and that\u2019s assuming that none of the additional test we do during the course of the year really come through and deliver better results. So we are ending the year, feeling pretty good about where it's that. But it\u2019s still a constant challenge in Direct Response. We have to constantly find better ways to do things to continue that growth. But I feel very good where we are going into the year.", "Mike Grondahl \u2013 Northland Securities", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Hey, good afternoon, everybody. So, just a couple of quick questions to go through risk based capital just a little bit more, and the free cash flow commentary just to make sure I have got this straight. So, year-end \u201808 the 329 RBC was roughly $1.3 billion of total adjusted capital and about $390 million of required capital.", "Gary, I think you mentioned a fall into around 245% or 250%, as of June, can you give us the comparable what the numerator and denominator sort of in a range was, with the vast majority of that drop driven by the denominator rising?", "Gary Coleman", "While we were at 12/31/08, it was a $1.281 billion of capital and $1.389 [ph] of required capital, and where we were at June, we saw a decline in capital due to impairments and we also believed the biggest impact was the increase in the RBC, and it was up about a little over $50 million.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. So the denominator was up about $50 million, the numerator would make up about the rest?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. And then Joe, as you sit here and look forward under your scenario on the December year-end \u201809, getting back to that sort of \u2013 I think you mentioned 313% was your internal estimate based on some of these movements and expectations, what\u2019s the composition then, like if we level \u2013 if we take that forward from June to December, I guess, I would have to imagine that the vast majority of the improvement there is actually coming from the increase in the numerator with the injections down?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that\u2019s the greater part, but we have also reduced the denominator, as I mentioned with the sales \u2013 and of course \u2013 we are going to have investments in the fourth quarter, we factored that in. But, we are reducing the required capital \u2013 or the risk based capital, but the bigger impact is $175 million of cash that we put in.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "That's going in on the numerator. Okay. Okay. And then how about retention of earnings, is that playing a major role here, are you still dividending under your normal scheme up to the holding company?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, it\u2019s a normal \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed anything there.", "Mark McAndrew", "Although, next year, Gary, as we talked about, as you mentioned, we will probably spread the dividends out more evenly during the year, just to maintain that RBC during the course of the year.", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s for next year. I thought you were talking about what we had done this year.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Yes. I know. I appreciate the commentary about next year. Yes, it\u2019s helpful. Okay. And then I want to do come back to, Ed, I think, was pushing back on you a little bit on the $210 million to $230 million free cash flow to the parent in 2010. Yes, I mean, that\u2019s definitely below your normal historical level. I understand earnings, maybe a little bit more conservative, maybe they are pressured a bit by net investment income, but I mean, is that \u2013 is that 210 to 230, is that purely driven by the level of statutory earnings in calendar year 2010 or is some of that carryover from 2009?", "Gary Coleman", "No, actually the dividends that we\u2019ll take from the insurance companies in 2010 will be based on 2009 earnings.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Yes.", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. So that\u2019s \u2013 we are also going to see a little bit of increase in our interest expense because we issued a $300 million debt in June.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Got it.", "Gary Coleman", "But, really I cautioned you on the free cash number. Again, I don't have our third quarter statutory, and it\u2019s really\u2026", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "It\u2019s just been early estimate.", "Gary Coleman", "An early estimate. I think it will be at least that much. And really my point in giving that number is that we feel like we\u2019ll have $150 million of cash at year-end, and then year-end \u201909, and then we think call it 230 \u2013 free cash next year or that will give us another $380 million of cash.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "In addition to that, John, within the companies, assuming no impairments we are going to generate about an extra $100 million of earnings over what we take out in dividends.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "That is down in the new life companies, is that right?", "Gary Coleman", "It has been in the life companies. And so\u2026", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "To get what the\u2026", "Gary Coleman", "There is an extra 100 million \u2013 that\u2019s going to be generated within the company that, you know, goes to capital, and if there are impairments, it can come out of that first before we ever even have to take any of the $380 million.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Got it. Back down. Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "So I think we are \u2013 I think we are in a very good position, and I think we\u2019ve got a lot of good things going for us here.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. And the other question is more on the business. Looking at the life insurance results, they are just watching a trend of commissions and acquisition expenses, you know, obviously realizing a couple of cases sales have been doing pretty well, but are commission levels in sort of absolute terms or maybe as a percentage of premium, percentage of new sales, are commission levels higher than they were maybe a year or two ago to the agent?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, at American income they\u2019re the same basically as they have been for 10 years.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "In the direct response side, we are not commissions \u2013 acquisitions and expenses, as I mentioned, in 2009 will be significantly less than what they ran last year. Liberty National, they are up, but they are up because the persistency of the business deteriorated. So we are deferring that over a shorter period of time over less premiums.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "It's not that we have raised commissions; it is because the persistency of the business deteriorated. We have to amortize quicker.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on that on the issue with respect to the \u2013 I appreciated your openness and your commentary about your controls over that \u2013 the \u2013 over those sales. Have you been able to recapture any of those commissions?", "Gary Coleman", "I don't have a number of some. But that 's \u2013 the agents who are writing the poor-quality business are really the agents that we\u2019ve seen turn over.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Yes. Okay. And so just get rid of them, and, you know, it\u2019s a cost, but it is a cost and we are done.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. Understood.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Colin Devine with Citi.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Hopefully, two final ones for you. First, you have talked a lot about book keeping more cash in the insurance operations, a little more cash liquidity at the holding company.", "What does that mean for your long-term ROE expectations? Are those going to be a little lower in the future than perhaps we have seen in the past? And then the second question, when do you think we are going to start to see the, sales growth you've had in the last, six or seven quarters, and life starts to flow through to moving the a lot of the (inaudible) little faster?", "Mark McAndrew", "You want to address the ROE, Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Colin, first of all, we've already seen a little bit of decline in ROE this year from holding cash. Again, the great bulk of that cash is down at the insurance companies and we are \u2013 we are now going to get that invested. Remember, I said, we were holding cash to the end of June and we got that invested in third quarter and also we did portfolio repositioning and we ended up with $700 million extra cash.", "But we are going to get that invested, and so we still have the cash as a holding company, and, you know, if we hold that, that will \u2013 that will have an impact on the ROE, but, you know, one thing to remember out of that 14.6 ROE that we were reporting, almost nine points of that come from insurance and operations. So we are going to have that, and I think that the ROE will stabilize, and I don\u2019t think you are going to see much of a climb from where we are now.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Sort of stabilizing more in a 14, 15 range, and stay there at 15 to 16, you enjoyed in the past?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think it can be between where we are now and 15. But, again, it has dropped down to 14.6 because we haven\u2019t got that money invested. We will get that invested and we will see the impact of that. On the life premiums, we\u2019ve been running roughly 2% growth in life (inaudible) with the sales projections we made for last year, for next year, we expect the life premiums to grow somewhere around 4% to 5% next year, so we\u2019ll start to see improvement in our life premiums next year with a continued growth of sales.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "What does that mean, then, for your thoughts about just sort of long-term nominal (inaudible) growth rate for Deutsche Mark?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that\u2019s where \u2013 we got to continue to obviously grow sales. If we are continuing to grow sales double-digit, the growth on life premiums will continue to accelerate. Now, it would take us to get it to say 10% growth \u2013 that would take us a couple of more years, obviously, to accelerate it from 4 to 5 up into that kind of range. But, as long as we can continue to grow sales double-digits, each year, that percentage grows in premiums should improve by a couple of percentage points.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Okay. So we should expect perhaps a little lower ROE, which reflects reality today, but perhaps somewhat faster or stronger organic growth? Is that a fair take-away for the outlook?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes. That's our hope.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ed Spehar with Banc of America.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Thanks, just one quick follow-up to John\u2019s question. Gary, when you said that these numbers, assuming you are going to keep \u2013 I think you said $110 million of statutory earnings down at the life company. Does that mean that when we are talking about this free cash flow number that it\u2019s \u2013 that it\u2019s not just, the \u2013 it\u2019s not the full dividend you would historically take up. It\u2019s, not 100% of prior year\u2019s earnings, it\u2019s two-thirds or something?", "Gary Coleman", "No, Ed, what I meant by that is our earnings next year, within the insurance companies, will be greater than what we are dividending out. Remember, what we are dividending out is coming from 2009 earnings. The earnings will be\u2026", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Right, I got it. Okay, I got it.", "Gary Coleman", "And that in itself will be greater, we think around a $100 million. So therefore, capital will go up just for that reason alone.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Right. And then \u2013 in terms of operating earnings, are statutory operating earnings, don\u2019t they sort of run about 100 million a quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 we are projecting it will be in or around $360 million for next year.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Just on an operating basis.", "Gary Coleman", "Right, on operating basis.", "Ed Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and we hope to be with you again next quarter.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Please note that this call is being recorded and is also simultaneously webcast. At this time I will turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark McAndrew; please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, Chief Financial Officer, Larry Hutchinson, our General Counsel, Rosemary Montgomery, Chief Actuary and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of my comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly please refer to our 2008 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $122 million or $1.47 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $113 million or $1.36 per share. Excluding FAS 115 our return on equity was 14.3% and our book value per share was $44.22 a 13% increase from a year ago.", "On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity investments carried at market value, book value was $40.87 per share. In our life insurance operations premium revenue grew 4% to $418 million and life underwriting margins increased 2% to $114 million. Life net sales were $81 million, up 5% from a year ago. At American income life premiums were up 11% to $132 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $43 million.", "Net life sales increased 24% to $35 million. Producing agents at American Income grew to 4,154, up 35%. I am pleased with results at American Income. We believe we have the processes in place to sustain long term double-digit growth and life sales as well as premiums and underwriting margins. We continue to test new ways to improve these processes to enhance our agent recruiting, training and retention as well as our policy persistency.", "In our direct response operation life premiums were up 6% to $133 million and life underwriting margin grew 13% to 35 million. Net life sales were down 3% to $30 million for the quarter but increased 7% for the full year. For 2010 we expect to see low single-digit growth in life sales during the first quarter improving to double-digit growth for the balance of the year. At Liberty National life premiums declined 2% to $74 million and life underwriting margin was down 26% to $14 million.", "Net life sales for the Liberty National offices declined 26% to $10 million and the producing agent count was down to 1,740. The decline in life sales and producing agents was greater than we expected during the quarter. While we have seen significant improvement in our policy persistency it will take us little longer to rebuild than I indicated on the last call.", "The sales and agent count numbers should stabilize in the first quarter and begin to show growth in the second quarter. We now expect low single-digit growth for the full year 2010. On the health side premium revenue excluding Part D declined 11% to $201 million and health underwriting margin was down 18% to $34 million. Health net sales increased 28% to $39 million due primarily to strong group Medicare supplement sales which are normally concentrated in the fourth quarter.", "We remain cautiously optimistic concerning renewed growth in our Medicare supplement sales, particularly in the second half of 2010. By June 1 we expect to introduce a new standardized Medicare supplement plan as well as reprice our existing products in many states. We believe we will be better able to compete not only with Medicare advantage plans but with other companies offering Medicare supplement products.", "Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $45 million for the quarter, a 4% increase while underwriting margin improved 16% to $6 million. Part D sales grew 69% for the quarter to $27 million, and were up 52% for the full year. Underwriting margin for our annuity business was $1.1 million for the quarter versus a loss of $8.8 million in the year ago quarter. Administrative expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 13% from a year ago. For the full year administrative expenses were down 3%.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital. First, investment portfolio, on our website there are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11 billion, including $10.2 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs.", "Combined RMBS, CMBS and mortgage loans are $38 million. Of the $10.2 billion of fixed maturities $9.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. The low investment grade bonds are $824 million, 8.1% of fixed maturities. We began 2009 with $712 million of below investment grade bonds 7.4% fixed maturities at that time. By June 30 the below investment grade bonds are grown to $1.2 billion, 13% of the portfolio due primarily to down grades of formally investment grade securities.", "In the last six months of 2009 there were no material down grades and we reduced below investment grade bonds through sales of $350 million and impairments of $76 million, thus ending the year with $824 million of below investment grade bonds. We expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 8.1% is still high relative to our peers.", "However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity excluding FAS 115 is 22% which is likely less than the peer average. Overall the total portfolio is rated BBB plus same as a year ago. During the quarter we charged realized caps losses for other than temporary impairments four bonds. The total charge was $25 million pretax or $16 million after tax including net gains on asset sales, net realized capital losses for the quarter were $15 million after tax.", "Year-to-date realized capital losses are $93 million after tax. For further information regarding impairments, see the schedule on our website entitled summary of net realized investment losses. Net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio are $456 million compared to $1.8 billion a year ago. They are $60 million higher than in September primarily because Treasury rates increased slightly more than spreads tightened in most of our sectors.", "Now I would like to discuss the asset types within our fixed maturity portfolio. 74% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 14% is in redeemable preferred stocks. All of the $1.4 billion are redeemable preferred stated maturity date in other characteristics that make them more like debt securities and to date all scheduled interest payments have been received none of these securities are perpetual preferred.", "Municipal bonds now comprise 10% of the portfolio compared to 3% a year ago. In 2009 we purchased $773 million of build America bonds. These are taxable debt securities issued by state and local governments who receive a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the required interest payments. Our BAB bonds are rated AA and have an average yield of 6.3%.", "Due to concentration considerations we do not expect to make significant investments in build America bonds in 2010. The remaining 2% of the portfolio consists primarily government related securities, our CDO exposure is down to $55 million in two securities were the underlying collateral is primarily bank and insurance company trust preferred.", "Now to conclude discussion of investments our recovery investment yield. We ended the third quarter with excess cash due primarily to the portfolio repositioning undertaken late in that quarter to reduce the amount of below investment grade bonds. At September 30 we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, short-term investments, and receivables from the sale of securities.", "In the fourth quarter we invested $879 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the municipal, industrial, and utility sectors. We invested an average annual effective yield of 6% and average rating of A, and an average life of 18 years to 23 years. For the full year we invested $2.3 billion at an average yield of 6.4%, rating of A and life of 16 to 21 years.", "For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.86%, compared to 6.97% yield earned in each of the previous eight quarters. The decline in yield is due primarily to the previously mentioned portfolio repositioning that took place late in the third quarter into a lesser extent the lower fourth quarter new money yield. As of 12/31/09, the yield on the portfolio is 6.81%.", "We ended the year with $590 million of cash in short term investments, $435 million in the insurance companies; and $155 million in the parent company. Now regarding RBC, as previously indicated, we intend to maintain RBC ratio at the 300% plus level held in past years. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Entering 2009, our consolidated RBC ratio was 329%, but by June 30, the ratio had fallen to 245% due to bond impairments and down grades and a disproportionate share of dividends to the parent during the first half of the year. In the last half of 2009, we took steps to improve the RBC ratio. We increased the capital of the insurance companies by having the parent company contribute $175 million, $125 million in the third quarter, and $50 million in the fourth quarter, and we reduced required capital by selling below investment grade bonds.", "Although we haven\u2019t finalized our 2009 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/09 will be in the range of 325% to 330%, this mean that we are approximately $125 million of capital in excess of that required to meet the target 300% ratio. In addition, assuming no impairments, we estimate that excess capital should increase by around $100 million in 2010 primarily, because statutory income will exceed dividends paid to the parent.", "Regarding liquidity, at December 31, parent company had $155 million of cash. In addition, we estimate that free cash flow for 2010 will add another $260 million of cash. As a result, the total cash available at the parent for 2010 will be around $415 million. In addition to the cash at the parent, we have other sources of liquidity such as debt issuance, increased credit facilities and inner company financing.", "Although we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need to tap these sources, they could provide another $1.2 billion of cash. Based on the $150 million of excess capital within the insurance companies at 12/31/09 and the expectation that it will grow in 2010, and the available cash and other liquidity at the parent, we believe there is more than sufficient liquidity to offset the impact on statutory capital of future realized losses in down grades.", "In 2010, we plan to utilize excess cash as efficiently as possible, but we\u2019ll be prudent in doing so. We plan to maintain a cash reserve at the parent and then determine the best use of the remaining cash after we\u2019re sure that our desired capital levels will be maintained.", "Those are my comments I will turn the call beck to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you Gary, the last year-and-a-half has been a difficult time for Torchmark and our industry. A number of tough decisions were made in the last year to ensure our liquidity insolvency at the expense of growth and earnings. I am pleased with the results we\u2019ve had during this difficult time and confident that the worst of this crisis is behind us. We can now refocus our efforts on improving our earnings growth.", "Those are my comments for this morning. Kayla, I\u2019ll now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Paul Ryan - Macquarie.", "Paul Ryan - Macquarie", "Its my first question on Liberty is thinking about where the problem exactly is, I guess to frame my question, if you\u2019re still hiring agents at the same rate and the question is, are you seeing new agents leave sooner than before the comp changes, or is it primarily the agents that were there in place when you made the changes?", "Mark McAndrew", "Paul, I would have to say, its sum of both. We made some changes in our compensation, really set higher standards for persistency in quality business being written and that did cause some increased turnover, particularly in agents who were writing poorer quality business, but also unfortunately the focus being on improving the quality of the business took some of the focus away from our recruiting.", "So in the fourth quarter our recruiting numbers at Liberty National were also down about 25% from where they were prior year. So we believe we made the changes that are necessary there. We actually had to close some office during the quarter, but we now are refocused on getting our recruiting backup and moving forward.", "Paul Ryan - Macquarie", "Do you expect that recruiting to come back towards the level it was before the changes in the near term?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, I do, by the end of the first quarter I expect our recruiting levels be back at prior levels.", "Paul Ryan - Macquarie", "Turning to the capital position, I guess if I add up what you have now plus what you\u2019re expecting to generate over 2010, around $640 million before any realized capital losses. So you say that, you plan to hold a cushion at the holding company. Can you hand if talk about how you will decide how big of a cushion to hold? When you\u2019ll start thinking about deploying some of that capital?", "Mark McAndrew", "We have a Board meeting here in two weeks, which that will be a topic of discussion. As Gary mentioned, we feel good about the capital that we have in the subsidiaries. Right now we have I think Gary said $125 million of excess capital there, and that should grow by another $100 million this year, so we think we have more than adequate capital in the insurance companies.", "So I mean it\u2019s something that we need to address that the $415 million of cash that we\u2019re going to have at the parent. I can\u2019t really say at this point how much of a cushion we will keep there, or exactly how much we might use for share repurchase or other uses at this point. Something we\u2019ll definitely be discussing in next Board meeting.", "Paul Ryan - Macquarie", "Do you think it might be difficult to ask you how to handicap it, but do you think there will be a chance you\u2019ll start share repurchases before the end of the year?", "Mark McAndrew", "It\u2019s hard to handicap that, but if I look at our capital situation and the excess cash that we have, we would definitely look for a good use of that cash between now and the end of the year. We don\u2019t need to hold $415 million of excess cash.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Grondahl - Northland Securities.", "Michael Grondahl - Northland Securities", "Could you just kind of take us through the growth initiatives you have for American Income and direct response and what you\u2019re trying to accomplish there on the growth side in 2010 and get us thinking a little bit about 2011 growth?", "Gary Coleman", "Mike, I shouldn\u2019t point out, and one of the reasons our life sales don\u2019t look quite as attractive this year as we monitor our sales and track our sales on a weekly basis. So we typically report 13 weeks of sales in our financials, which means about once every five years, we have a 14 week quarter, which the fourth quarter of 2008 was a 14 week quarter. So part of the only having 5% growth in our life sales this year is a poor quarter to compare with last year.", "We did have a 14 week quarter at fourth quarter of last year, so actually our life sales if I compare the same 13 weeks that we reported this year, we were actually up 12% versus the five, so we are continuing to see a very positive trend there. If I look at American Income, again, we\u2019ve been making changes there for the last two and a half to three years as far as taking control of the lead generation and some of the changes we made in our bonus compensation, and we feel very good about where it\u2019s at today. We went from 63 to 70 SGAs during the year.", "We increased our lead generation by 11% for the year, and it\u2019s really in a good spot right now. Some of the things we\u2019re doing, I guess the biggest thing we\u2019re doing. As I mentioned in prior calls, changing the sales process to a laptop sales presentation. We\u2019re taking this very slowly. We\u2019re introducing it with a handful of our SGAs at this point in time, but the early results are very good.", "We\u2019re getting higher average face amount, higher average premium, higher closing ratio, so I think that has the potential to continue to fuel growth. Although even without that we\u2019ve fully expected to see growth. We think we can continue to maintain the level of growth that we\u2019ve been seeing at American Income.", "Direct Response, I think we reported sales down 3%, again if I compare the same 13 weeks with 13 weeks a year ago was actually up 8.5% for the same comparable period. We\u2019ve got very good things going on in Direct Response. We\u2019ve had some very encouraging tests.", "Second half of 2009 with particularly in our packaging, we tried some packages where we\u2019ve had more personalization and a higher quality package, and it generates substantially 15% to 18% better response and the test that is we performed. Unfortunately we have to order new equipment and order the rollout with these new packages, and that equipment won\u2019t be installed until April. So I feel very good about the second half of this year and Direct Response should see double-digit growth in sales.", "First quarter, some of the cutbacks that we did in the second half of last year, we only expect low single-digit growth in the first quarter, but that growth will accelerate significantly in the second half, really in the last three quarters of the year. So I feel good about where it is. Although it\u2019s still a constant challenge to find new and better ways to do things. Based upon the results of the tests, we\u2019ve already seen. I feel very good about the growth that we\u2019re going to see in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "The Medicare Advantage disenrollees, you\u2019re thinking that could be sort of inflection point in the market behind sort of mid year new product rollout. What are you seeing from Medicare Advantage di-senrollees in the marketplace? How is Obama healthcare snafu play into that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Bob, that remains to be seen. I guess unless some of the estimates that I\u2019d seen prior to the election in Massachusetts were that the Medicare Advantage enrollments would go from $11.5 million to roughly $4.5 million over the next three years. I\u2019m not without healthcare reform or without knowing where healthcare reform is going to end up.", "I guess there\u2019s more question about just how many people will be disenrolled there and how that funding will be affected. I still think they\u2019ve got to reduce the funding from Medicare Advantage plans with or without healthcare reform, but it may not be quite as quickly. We still believe that there\u2019s a market there.", "We picked up a little bit of business but less than 1,000 disenrollees in the fourth quarter. We still believe that market will rebound, but again we\u2019re not making any wild projections of what we think that might be. So I guess I would still say we\u2019re cautiously optimistic.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "On the buyback you already have authorization, just a tactical question. Do you feel like you have to tell the investment world that you\u2019re buying back stock before you\u2019re doing it?", "Mark McAndrew", "I will defer to our General Counsel, but yes. Since we announced that we were discontinuing it, we have to get reauthorized.", "Larry Hutchison", "That\u2019s correct.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "So you would have to have a Board meeting first before you could begin to buy?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, that\u2019s correct, Bob.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management", "Just a quick question, the required interest on net policy liabilities and the income statement, it is going up on an absolute basis, but not quite as much as at least we had modeled and so it is not focus on a lot. I was wondering if you give a color on what\u2019s going on there and if indeed that is a slowing obligation?", "Mark McAndrew", "Rosemary, do you want to fill that one?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Well, the required interest for one thing we do split it out between what we have for the life and the health business versus the annuity business, since the annuity business is actually based on a credited rate that we declare monthly and so that can have a little bit of fluctuation to it, but the actual interest on the net liability is really pretty stable as I see it going through \u201809, at least for the life and the health business, and changing a little bit more than that for the annuity business, but still something that we see as a pretty stable number.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management", "So it\u2019s not something that would necessarily be trending down because of the low overall interest rate environment?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Not particularly, no.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management", "Because the in force block is so big relative to the new obligations?", "Rosemary Montgomery", "Right.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management", "Then if I could, just on the risk based capital ratio, to kind of understand maybe some of the drivers with Gary, how much rating drift impact was there in the fourth quarter or is there anyway to quantify that hit against the denominator?", "Gary Coleman", "Randy, there was very little in the fourth quarter, and what we gave in the last two calls we gave a best case estimate, worst case estimate, and our best case I think we said no down grades, and we saw that came true as we really had. I can\u2019t remember the exact number, but it\u2019s very small amount in the fourth quarter.", "So denominator didn\u2019t change that much. Now, what we did pickup a little in terms of the relaxation on the deferred taxes and statutory side, we picked up $40 million to $50 million there and then we had our earnings were a little higher, so more of the increase came, because we had more capital than we expected as opposed to lower change in the expected or the required capital.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Management", "Then just quickly on the commercial paper program. It looks like kind of a similar size to what it was in the third quarter. Do you intend to keep that size of program out there just to keep it marketable? Is that a fair statement?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, we\u2019re at $230 million of CP and to be marketable. We need to at least have $100 million out there. Now, we could reduce that somewhat. Obviously, we\u2019ve got enough cash at the parent company to do that, but the cost of that just keeps going down. The cost is about 40 basis points, and we\u2019re not increasing it. ", "We\u2019re just as money matures we just roll it over and with rates being so low, I don\u2019t see a need to reduce and now if we see rates going up, we\u2019ve got cash at the holding company if we need it we can pay that down.", "Operator", "With no further questions, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to your host, Mr. McAndrew.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel, and Mike Majors Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2009 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the first quarter was $127 million or a $1.52 per share, a per share increase of 2% from a year ago. Net income was $122 million or $1.46 per share versus $0.91 a year ago. Excluding FAS115, our return on equity was 13.6% and our book value per share was $45.37, a 12% increase from a year ago. On a GAPP reported basis with fixed maturity investments carried at market value book value was $44.13 per share.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $430 million and life underwriting margins increased 5% to $116 million, life net sales were $85 million up 9% from a year ago. At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $135 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $44 million. Net life sales at American increased 25% to $34 million producing agents in at American Income grew to 4,201 up 20% from a year ago. ", "It was another outstanding quarter at American Income. During the quarter, we began implementation of a need based sales presentation via laptop computer. Initial results have been very encouraging. We will continue to expand introduction of this new sales process over the next three quarters, and we project sales growth at American Income to be in the 15% to 20% range for the full year. ", "In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to a $144 million and like underwriting margins grew 15% of $38 million, net life sales were better than anticipated up 8% to $37 million. As a percentage of life premium, like underwriting margin was 26% from the quarter, up from 24% a year ago. We expect this favorable trend to continue for the balance of 2010. ", "We also expect to see improved sales growth in the 10% to 15% for the next three quarters as a result of successful test conducted in the second half of last year. Life premiums at Liberty National declined 1% to $74 million, and life underwriting margin was down 17% to $14 million. Net life sales for the Liberty National [office] declined 29% to $9 million, and the producing agent count was down to 1,535, 12% less than year end. The agents count at Liberty [harvest] was basically flat since the end of January, and net sales have also stabilized, sales should improve over first quarter levels going forward although, we now expect a small decline for the full year 2010. ", "On the health side premium revenue excluding part D declined 10% to $203 million and health underwriting margin was down 13% to $35.5 million. Health net sales decreased 17% from a year ago to $17 million. Health care reform legislation will have an impact on some of our product portfolio. The effective products contributed $1.8 million of net sales in the first quarter and represented $109 million of enforced premiums at quarter end. ", "New sales of these products will be discontinued prior to September of this year, but we don\u2019t believe there will be an impact on a rapidly declining enforced block before 2014 which would make the impact immaterial. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $52 million for the quarter, a 14% increase while underwriting margin was flat at $5 million. ", "Part D sales for the quarter grew 64% to $17 million. Underwriting margin from our annuity business was $140,000 during the first quarter versus a $4.1 million loss a year ago. Administrate expenses were $38 million, down 4% from a year ago. For the full year, we currently project administrative expenses to increase by 1%. ", "I will now turn the call over the Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and capital liquidity. First the investment portfolio. On our website are prescheduled to provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31st, 2010. As indicated on the schedules invested assets are $11.4 billion including $10.6 billion of fixed maturities and advertise cost. Combined RMBS and mortgage loans are $36 million, and we no CMBS exposure. Now the fix maturities $9.7 billion our investment grade with an average rating of A minus.", "Below investment grade bonds are $891 million, 8.4% of fixed maturities compared to $824 million at 12/31/09 and $1.3 billion a year ago. The $67 million increase from the fourth quarter is due primarily to downgrade the certain trust preferred securities. We expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 8.4% is still high relative to our peers. However, due to our significant lower portfolio leverage the percentage of below investment grade bonds or equity excluding FAS115 is 24% which is like to lessen the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB plus same as a year ago.", "During the quarter, we recognize and other than temporary impairment of $1.7 million pretax at $1.1 million after tax. In addition, we recognize $6 million of after tax, net gains on an asset dispositions. Thus for the quarter, we had net realized capital gains of $5 million after tax. Net unrealized losses is in fixed maturities portfolio were $173 million compared to $456 million at year end '09 and $2.2 billion a year ago.", "The decrease in the first quarter is due primarily to credit switch decline more than [trade] relate increased. Now, we\u2019ll go to the asset types of [portfolio]. 7% to 4% as a fixed maturities portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 13% as redeemable preferred stock. All at $1.4 billion of redeemable preferred have a stated maturity date and other characteristics that make them more like debt securities, and today all scheduled interest payment have been received, none of these securities are perpetual preferred. ", "Municipal bonds comprised 1% of the portfolio compared to 3% a year ago. Since the second quarter 2009, we have approached a $178 million of Build America Bonds. These are taxable debt securities issued by state or local governments who receive a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the required interest payment. Our BAB bonds are rated AA and have an average yield of 6.4%. Due to concentration considerations, we do not expect to make significant investments in BAB bonds in the remainder of 2010. The remaining 2% of the portfolio consists primarily of government related securities, our CDO exposures down to $54 million and two securities where the underlying collateral is bank insurance company, plus preferred securities. ", "Now to conclude the discussion on investments I will cover the investment yield. We ended the fourth quarter 2009 with excess cash due primarily to the portfolio repositioning undertaken late in third quarter to reduce amount of loan investment grade bonds. Entering the year, we had approximately $590 million in cash and shorter term investments. In the first quarter, we invested $676 million at investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial, municipal and utilities sectors.", "We invested at an average annual effective yield of 6% and average rating rate minus and average life of 23 to 26 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.79% compared to the 6.86% yield earned in the previous quarter, and the 6.97% earned in the first quarter 2009. The decline in yield is due primarily to the previously mentioned portfolio re-positioning and to the lower new money yield. ", "As of March 31st, the yield [doing] portfolio is now 6.76%. We ended the quarter with $372 million cash and short term investments. A $178 million in the insurance companies and $194 million in the parent company. Regarding our RBC, in the past we maintained our RBC ratio at a 300% plus level. This ratio is lower than some of our peer companies that has been sufficient for our company in light our consistently statutorily earnings, relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and the level of our ratings.", "At year end 2009, the RBC ratio was 355%. As adjusted capital of $1.5 billion divided by the required capital of $416 million. Adjusted capital included approximately $70 million of additional deferred tax, assets allowed under 2009 change in regulatory accounting rule. As reported adjusted capital was approximately $225 million in excess of that required for the target 300% ratio. Excluding the additional tax benefits, the excess capital was a $155 million at [property] 109.", "In addition assuming no impairment are downgrades in the next week quarters, we estimate that excess capital will increase about $90 million during 2002 because of statutory income would exceed dividends paid to the parent company. As such excluding the $70 million for tax benefits excess cash with the insurance company level would grow to $245 million by the end of the year. Although we expect some level of impairments and downgrades over next three quarters. $245 million of excess capital should be more than sufficient to absorb them. ", "Now looking at our liquidity, the available cash at the parent consists of cash on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results from dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries, lesser dividends paid towards our shareholders and the interest paid on the debt. The parent company began the year with cash and short-term investments of $155 million.", "We expect that the parent's free cash flow from operations will be around $280 million for the full year at 2010. $84 million of that free cash was generated in the first quarter. Of that amount, we used $33 million to reduce commercial paper and $12 million to repurchase $220,000 TMK shares. The remaining $39 million was invested in short term. Thus at March 31st, the parent had $194 million of cash and short-term investments. In addition, we expect free cash flow from operations will provide approximately $195 million of additional cash over the next three quarters.", "So in summary regarding our liquidity and capital, first of all we expect to have more than enough excess capital and the interest comings to handle the impact of downgrades and impairment. In fact, excess capital levels at the insurance companies in 2010 would be more than sufficient to absorb even the extraordinary level of impairments in downgrades we experienced in 2009. As such we don\u2019t expect to have to contribute capital from the parent companies down to the insurance companies as we did last year. ", "Second we currently have $194 million in cash and invested assets of the parent company and it currently expect to maintain liquid assets at the parent around that level for the remainder of 2010. And finally as mentioned we expect the parent company to generate $195 million of additional free cash flow over the next three quarters. We will use this cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect the share repurchases will be one that uses that excess cash. Those are my comments and I will not turn it back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. We currently estimate earnings per share for 2010 will begin at $6.10 to $6.20 range assuming no additional share repurchase. We\u2019ve not included repurchases in our guidance due to the uncertainties surrounding the timing and volume of shares acquired. Those are my comment for this morning. I will now open it up for questions, Mark.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning and thank you everyone. Was the trend on 60% RBC, Gary is that correct?", "Gary Coleman", "We are slightly lower than the first quarter but due to some timing our dividend in income but there will be at that in the second quarter.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, so the truce is kind of re-bounce back up to 360 by the end of 2Q?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "With the timing of the subsidiaries stuff and then, on the parent cash, is that I heard right $194 million, is that correct?.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, that\u2019s all we have on hand at March 31st.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, and that was targeted to what at by the end of the year?", "Gary Coleman", "With over another $195 million ", "Mark McAndrew", "Right, we\u2019re going to have another $195 million of free cash and be generated over the next three quarters.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "So those two numbers that are similar, got it, and then this is probably for Mark, back to Liberty National, obviously sales were weaker there as you acknowledged in the opening comments, but you do have confidence that that can kind of net out to a small decline for the full year which means that it's kind of got to turn the corner pretty quick, and so I just would like to kind get more color on how Liberty National turns the corner from what we saw in the last two quarters?", "Mark McAndrew", "Again if I look at the trends, the agent count declined that we saw in the first quarter occurred in January, really since the end of January through today the count, the agent count is down less than 1%. So it's basically stable, and if I look at the trends of business being submitted and issued at Liberty it is trending upwards, it's still got ways to go. We do have some changes that we intend to make here this summer which we think will add to it, but again we are not projecting huge increases there. ", "By the time we get to fourth quarter we have little easier comparisons. So I am saying that I expect sales, I think the first quarter level of sales and agent count will be the low point for the year , and we will see upwards trends from there but realistically it will be probably be fourth quarter before we actually see growth in our sales versus a year ago just because of the easier comparison. But right now we are still expecting somewhere in the 1% to 3% decline in sales of Liberty for the year. ", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Just one more clarification, in your opening comments the 10% to 15% sales growth outlook that was at Globe right the direct channel?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "Operator", "And next is Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "", "Thanks. I had a question on just your outlook for health insurance sales. You're down 17% in the first quarter. The agent count at American seems like it's declining even more so, and then you mentioned the modest impact from healthcare reform as well. As you go through 2010, would you expect your sales to get better through the year or should we expect a similar rate through the rest of the year?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "We expect our health sales will improve as year goes on although our guidance right now expects second quarter sales to be roughly the first quarter level. Starting to see some improvement in the third quarter again, I first genuinely expected to introduce a new Medicare segment plan as well as have the repricing of our existing plans, and after that we are expecting relatively modest growth in the third quarter with better growth in the force assuming some one of our group sales are always better in the fourth quarter as well as we expect to see some benefits from the disenrollees from Medicare advantages plan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then secondly on just your share buybacks, if I look from 2005 through 2008 you're buying anywhere from $300 million to $400 million worth of shares each year. From here on out given where your RBC is how should we think about how much you can do in terms of buybacks later this year or into next year as well?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "There are some uncertainties there, right now our current thinking is that $194 million of free cash as Gary said is probably about level of liquid assets we are going to hold with the parent just to provide some cushion. We still expect to see another $195 million of excess cash coming into the parent during the next three quarters based upon our current plan. We would expect to spend most of that probably on share repurchase borrowing on acquisition or some other better use for the money, whereas next year we may still well hold that cushion.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And the incremental cash should be used for buybacks?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well again borrowing a better use for it, Jimmy. ", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And the better use would just be buying a block of business or an acquisition opportunity if one arises. Right?", "Mark McAndrew", "I would prefer to make an acquisition versus just buy a closed block of business.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Is the environment getting better now or have you identified anything or is that something you've identified that you're looking at or are you just expecting things to improve?", "Mark McAndrew", "I can say we are always looking Jimmy but that\u2019s what I can say on that.", "Operator", "Jeff Schuman with KBW is next.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "A couple of items. The annuity earnings I think were a bit lower than we would have normally expected in a decent equity market quarter. Is this kind of a new run rate or was that depressed a little bit this quarter?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "No, we got a little bit of a loss normally as you noticed we usually have Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary, but Rosemary has elected to take retirement so I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me.", "Gary Coleman", "Jeff, I don\u2019t know if anything that\u2019s really unusual in the quarter, if you compare sequentially, we had some unlocking in the fourth quarter last year that we have benefited from but its as in that, I don\u2019t know if there is anything unusual in this quarter.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "I can say that when we look at our guidance for the balance of the year, we are expecting pretty small really actually under 100,000 our quarter of annuity margins.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Less than $100,000, okay. Okay, that's helpful. Next the American Income sales looking for 15% to 20% growth for the full year. To what extent is that do you think that would be driven by higher agent count versus productivity? I know you didn't mention that there's kind of new needs-based sales process that you sounded positive about. So is that part of the growth driver there or was it mostly just agent count?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s primarily growth in agents. Again I think you\u2019ll notice that our, I think somebody brought up that our first year agent count in American Income decline slightly in the quarter. That I\u2019m not concerned with, in fact in retrospect there was big push put on in December to American Income to break to 4,000 agent mark and as a result we saw an increase in our terminations in January and February, but recruiting is still running at record levels, and the terminations came back to normal levels in March ,so we fully expect to see that type of continued growth in our agent count. We are not adding in much at this point for changes in with the laptop sales presentation.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Ed Spehar with Banc of America.", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Gary and Mark I got question on capital, if we look at the numbers you gave us and we think about I guess how you used to look at funds available for share repurchase, would it be correct to add the $245 million of excess at the sub plus the $194 million in cash at the end of March plus the $195 million of free cash over the next three quarters. ", "Mark McAndrew", "Well Ed never really use, again the excess capital at the insurance companies is not going to be available for share repurchase and as we said just taking what we think is a cautious approach, what we think we believe that insurance companies are all very well capitalized, have more than enough capital to cover most any contingency we do intend to hold some liquid assets of the parent company for the time being.", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Okay then sort of a related question would be if we are thinking about potential share buyback over the next two years the $195 million of free cash over the next three quarters, it seems like that something you would be willing to use buyback stock this year, if we think about next year without touching the cash and short term at the parent, and the current the expected capital margin at the sub level, would it be correct to think about another assuming a reasonable benign realized investment loss experienced this year would it be reasonable to think about a $350 million or more type of number potentially next year.", "Gary Coleman", "That might be a little high free cash flow for this year is going to be 280 ", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Gary, isn't that based on sort of what you would consider to be a depressed net statutory earnings number?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s true because we have the realized losses of about $100 million last year that impacted. So yes, that $280 million could go to $350 million. Unless we have impairment we only got $1 million to the first quarter, so and we are expecting ,we\u2019re not going to have that level that we had last year so yes you could get up in the $350 million level free cash flow.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Paul Sarran with Macquarie.", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie", "It\u2019s a question on Direct Response, sales growth of 8% on the quarter was better than what you had guided to of low single digits in the first quarter. So I guess I have two questions related to that. One, is there anything specific you can point to that kind of explains that better than expected performance and two, do you still expect the same level of sales boost for the rest of the year when you rollout the new enhanced packaging in the second quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, primarily in the first quarter I guess the biggest surprise was in our insured media where we insured one of our offers and other media. Those response rates made a nice comeback in the first quarter and higher than anticipated and that contributed most of the improvement in our first quarter sales. We still do expect to see on the Direct Response side, the improvements that we talked about before, with the beginning for the balance of the year. We still expect to see some of that turn to 15% sales growth after the balance of the year.", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks. And then on Liberty National, you mentioned further changes going in place this summer. Can you just elaborate on that comment a little bit?", "Mark McAndrew", "Really at this point I can't because they haven\u2019t been finalized and they haven\u2019t been announced so its something we are still in the process, by the next go I should have more details on that.", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie", "Okay and do you have an outlook for new agent recruiting at Liberty for the balance of the year? I mean should we expect first year agent counts to rebound quickly towards where they were the last couple years or with changes in comp and office closings and some better employment opportunities in the economy, should we expect a slower rebuilding process from current levels than we've seen in the past?", "Mark McAndrew", "Again I think it will be a slower rebuilding process and mainly because we did have a significant turnover on our management ranks? So that\u2019s our biggest challenge right now is rebuilding our management ranks, really before we see major improvement in our recruiting efforts, so we are projecting modest growth there in the agent count for the balance of this year.", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie", "Okay. And then how long does it take to kind of rebuild that management ranks? Is that a one year project, two year, three year? Do you have any sense?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I would say it\u2019s a one, two year together to where we needed to be. We should see significant improvement in 2011. But yes I would say it's fair to say it\u2019s a one to two year project.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Medicare Part D, the premiums were up double-digit, compared to sort of mid single digit last year. Was there more price or was this a better long-term versus lapses?", "Mark McAndrew", "Bob, we saw an uptake particularly in the fourth quarter on our group sales, we did pickup some significant group Part D sales which improved not so much price although you noticed that our margins were flat when we priced our Part D for 2010 back in may of 2009. Basically the margin we are going to see this year is about one point less, and what we desire which we hope to make up next year, our price is still in a ballpark with most other people, but most of the uptake has been in our good side.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "I thought when you went in this a couple years ago the thought process was great return on capital, but it's going to be sort of slow, gradual erosion sort of in the top line. Was that a misimpression or has this bills business held together more than you expected?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, prior to this year, it has been the track that it has been on, probably now I think our opinions changed with healthcare reform legislation and actually the expected cut in funding for Medicare advantage plans. Most of people had the Part D where they have there Medicare advantage. So, I would expect as we see an improvement on our Medicare supplement sales that we would also see similar improvement on our Part D sales, and again how we continue to see good market there, they are in a good size.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "The (inaudible) [break rate] I was focusing on the Part D, and the bigger, your med supp on the health side, the things broke right with Obama care, when could we see sales and even being more optimistic premiums start to improve? Is this a year or two out or three to five years out?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "I wish I had a crystal ball Bob I think we are going to have a much better idea between now and the end of the year. What to expect there again around the 1st of June we expect to have new product, with new pricing on addition products. We are seeing more interest particularly in independent agency world. We got lot more agents contacting us with renewed interest in Medicare supplement. But we at this point we really don\u2019t know how many dis-enrollments are going to be at the end of this year although based upon CMS estimates over the next seven years, I expect roughly 7.5 million to this dis-enrollment. But we don\u2019t know what the timing that was going to be. So there is a lot of big question mark there, and in our guidance we haven\u2019t assumed anything as far as any significant growth in Medicare this year. But I think we will learn a lot during the course of this year. How much and how fast that really occurred.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "", "Last question, has there been any buyback in April and could you quantify that if there has been?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Yes, we\u2019ve spent $8 million in bought back another 150,000 shares.", "Operator", "", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital has a question.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "", "My first question relates to the health business. What are the specific products that you expect to be affected most profoundly by the healthcare legislation and why?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "We\u2019ve been selling our products through United American really since the Medicare settlement marker place deteriorated. That is a broad benefit hospital search goal type power so it has internal limits for you but for example it would pay, if you go to the hospital it could pay after $3000 a day while you are in a hospital. ", "More if you are in a emergency room, that's a broad benefit product I think our average premium on that was over $2000 a year for that product. But it has the lower mandate in loss ratio. But we are seeing in the healthcare legislation, and benefits do not meet the standards being set out. But that is the business that we have de-emphasized and basically gotten out over the last couple of years. That is what you are seeing run of the books. So it's only $1.8 million sales in the first quarter, we still have roughly 100 million on the books.", "But by the end of 2013, we would expect that block of business to be down another 70% of that business full of flat stuff like that so it would not be a significant portion of our overall business.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "", "You're saying by 2013 what percentage of it will have gone away?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "About a 109, we expect about based on current rates roughly 70% of (inaudible).", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "", "Over next three year ", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Yes.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "Okay. My next question relates to agent recruiting. You have been busy in recent years restructuring your relationships with your agents not only at Liberty, but also at American Income and it's just striking that the agent count at American Income has been moving pretty steadily upward, whereas it has moved in the opposite direction at Liberty and at United American. Why is that? Help us understand the difference in the outcomes there?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, an explanation would take longer than I have in this call, I\u2019d be happy to sit down with you sometime you\u2019d like to more details, but there are significant differences between the two. One, American Income has a unique niche, they have, there are some things there. It was interesting that our newest board member happens to be chief operation officer, 7/11 and obviously talking to him is some is like the difference between a company-owned storey in a franchise. American Income is more of a franchise. These people, they are independent contractors, the SGAs, they manage all their own expenses. We pay them straight commission and they are much more entrepreneurs I guess versus at Liberty National, we rent the offices, all these people are employees. There are significant differences in the way the two operate.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "Last question, I'd like to re-ask a question I asked in a prior call, which is understanding that there are important uncertainties here regarding healthcare and the future of your health business, and nonetheless like you to take a fresh crack at this question. What do you think three years from now the business is going to look like on the health side? And by that I mean specifically which distribution channels will most likely be selling your health products, and what will the complexion of the business be both and well, the new business. Where will the focus be in terms of new business, and who will be selling it when the dust settles, so to speak?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, as far as we are concerned, I think we continue be in the March, so again if I look at Liberty National, most of their health business is being written through favorable reduction on the work side. None of those supplemental health products are being affected by the legislation. We expect that to continue to be a growing market and obviously Medicare supplement. I fully expect that market to rebound, I think we will see a rebound in the independent agent market faster than we will in our captive of distribution. But three years from now, that\u2019s a long way to look, but I do expect the bulk of our health sales, I would expect we wouldn\u2019t be back with high percentage of our health sales would again be Medicare supplement three year from now.", "Eric Berg - Barclays Capital", "So in summary, it sound like Liberty will remain an important distributor, United American, and you will be selling both Medicare supplement and [survive] busiest product?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes we will. Those two product lines are unaffected, at least have no negative impacts from healthcare legislation, and on the Medicare side, we think it will have a significant positive impact.", "Operator", "Next question will come from Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities.", "Mike Grondahl - Northland Securities", "Mark, can you just kind of give us a quick overview of the new sales presentation? I think it's the laptop version that you're using in American Income, and just kind of how you expect that to roll out and kind of affect productivity and sort of sales levels going forward?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, I\u2019ll try to be again as brief as I can but in the past and Bernard Rapaport, founder of American Income, I think the world of he put the current sales presentation of American Income, he put together roughly 40 years ago, and it was targeting set premium for people to invest in their life insurance, he called it in hour of power, so they were trying to get people to take one hours pay a week and buy life insurance with. ", "What we are trying to move to is more of a selling people what they need, first thing we do is take a survey, do you own a home? Do you have children? What is your income? What are your expenses? And gather financial information and look at with our current existing coverage is whether be group individual and the laptop then analyzes it and identifies both the amount of coverage that we believe they need, and the type of product that best fits that need. ", "For there number of advantages to it. One we have consistency of sales presentation; it makes them far easier to train a new agent as far as sales presentation. We believe we will see a higher average face amount being sold as well as hopefully a higher average premium but a side benefit of that we hope that it will also improve our new agent retention because we think it will make it easier for a foreign agent become productive.", "Mike Grondahl - Northland Securities", "That\u2019s good to hear, when do you think that surged the cycle in a little bit?.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well again we just we have started with just a handful of agency, we want to control the training of this, we wanted to be done properly, and so I think we will see a trend in as the year goes along, but if its impossible at this point really project what that\u2019s going to add, it's just too early in the process . Again we just started this quarter introducing our first agents on it. So just too early by next quarter I should have much harder numbers on what we could expect to add.", "Mike Grondahl - Northland Securities", "Great. We look forward to hearing that too. Thank you.", "Operator", "John Nadel, Sterne, Agee has a next question.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "I joined a little bit late so I might have missed this but the sequential improvement in excess investment income if I think about first quarter versus fourth quarter, is most of that driven by the reinvestment of the proceeds from some of your portfolio repositioning that happened late last year?", "Gary Coleman", "John, that's the main reason, if you remember in the third quarter, we sold almost $750 million of bonds and half of those were below investment grade bonds, but we did that in the last week of the quarter, and we ended the third quarter with $1.1 billion of cash and short-term money, we got that invested large part in the fourth quarter but some of those win over in the first quarter, we saw if you just look at invested assets in the fourth quarter or third quarter, you saw a good growth but we got that\u2019s so late in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t get the fall in income for the quarter\u2019s revenue income. We finally got the first quarter\u2019s full growth of income in the first quarter this year. So that\u2019s just a delay.", "Mark McAndrew", "Sorry Coleman, we have to come down, a yearend we were holding $590 million of cash, Gary and that was on the $375 million at the end of the first quarter which we had expected to coming down in the second quarter.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Yes. What's the pace there that we should be thinking about it and, I saw the new money yield it was around 6% in the first quarter. I suspect it's relatively stable at this point still?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yeah, we\u2019re still around the 6% level and we are at $372 million of cash in short-term at the end of the first quarter. The $194 million will depend will probably, we are looking at different ways to invest and at this point there\u2019s any short-term money, well the $178 million short-term at the insurance company, we\u2019ll get that down a little bit but we\u2019ll always just because of the timing we\u2019ll do it near a $100 million. So we\u2019re pretty much got the money fully invested at this point.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "So the net investment income level in the first quarter that goes into your excess investment income is a reasonably good level to think about going forward?", "Gary Coleman ", "Well yes, in other words it will grow. I think over prior grow about the same sequential levels it had in prior to this, the first quarter was little bit anomaly but where as last year investment income in total in 1% because of all the cash we have this in 2010 is going to be closer to a 10% increase.", "Operator", "", "Next is Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates ", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "I'm going to admit I'm slightly confused here. It seems to me that you're suggesting that the $195 million of free cash flow that you're suggesting that you expect over the next three quarters is available and likely to be used for share repurchase. The guidance assumes no share repurchase. I just want to make sure that that is correct.", "Gary Coleman", "The guidance does not include any additional share repurchase. The $195 million, currently we would expect to use most of that in the share repurchase assuming nothing else comes along that would be that we feel like it would be a better use for it.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, great. I just wanted to make sure that I understood that. And then just following up on a couple of more that were asked, the block of business that will be affected by PPACA, just for information's sake, what's the underwriting margin on that? Would you happen to know, Mark?", "Mark McAndrew", "Its less than 10%, normally we have to call in Rosemary but my recollection is that right around 8%", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Right around 8%, okay. And then could you remind us, I remember what happened with the agent count at Liberty National. There was poor first year and even sooner persistency. You made some changes to improve that. That hurt your agent count. Did you do something in January or has this thing just leveled out and the people are going to make under the new commission structure are the people who are just going to make it?", "Mark McAndrew", "I think most of the changes were made back middle of last year, and I think it was kind of finally reach bottom in January. Although on a plus side, our persistency is now back at the 2007 levels which is a plus although we hope we continue to improve on that. But, I think it just took that long for the replication to flow [okay for yourself] ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Colin Devine with Citigroup", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Good morning. If we look at the sales and I guess the growth in underwriting margin on the life side that you've been putting up in Direct Response and American Income, it's certainly substantially higher than probably what most of us have associated with Torchmark and also the markets you're in. What do you attribute to your success, because clearly there's other companies we're looking at that are struggling. Where are you taking this share from and what is it that you're doing so right that others clearly are not?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, Colin I think one of our big advantage is we for the most of our controller distribution. I think that one of reasons we have higher margins and we have higher underwriting margins in American Income and Globe. If I look at American Income we just kind of model there that works I don\u2019t know how to explain that any other way, we had to make some changes over the years to get it where it is, but now we believe all the pieces are in place. We can sustain that type of sales growth gradually double digit sales growth and definitely going forward. The Direct Response, it's grown every year since 1985, so it just has long history, we have some extremely good people there and we are just keep finding ways to do things better and continue to achieve growth. ", "So I don\u2019t know if there any magic to it we have, we believing we have the best people with the knowledge, obviously our ability to control cost is a big plus for us one of the reasons we have very little competition there.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "", "I guess that also leads into we think of Liberty, in a sense, do you need to have perm agents and does that need to be a core part of what Torchmark does? I mean how long do you give it to get turned around and back on track before you start asking maybe some more difficult questions given that you've got the success in the other two channels?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well I feel obviously believe we can and will grow Liberty National, Liberty Nationals grow it hasn\u2019t seen growth rates similar to American Income in the 30 years as their own company but we do have to change the model, and we are changing the model at Liberty and as we are moving more towards what we have in American Income. I still believe in the next 12 to 24 months we will have the pieces in place at Liberty that we need. I look from 2003 to 2007 we saw decline in the EGM sales in American Income. We identify the problems. We knew it was going to take time to get changes in place that was needed to grow that company. But we did and now we are saving best for that, I believe the same will happen at Liberty National. ", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "", "So still going with the per agent force and that cost structure you think can be viable going forward versus going to a pure variable comp system?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "I think there is somewhere between I know that is something we have release shift in that direction. We may not get all the reporting to what we are in American Income. But we got to do something or even just for some of the accounting little changes that will see. We will move to more than variable cost structure at Liberty National.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "", "And then turning directions, on the sort of cash flow numbers that you put up, the 350, how dependent is that or how tied is it to the very strong growth and that you're putting up at Direct and American Income? The sales continue certainly at their pace. Are you able to generate enough excess cash flow by continuing to shrink the health business to kind of fund the growth on the life and keep that 350 number or is there some sensitivity to it we should be thinking? If you're seeing the strong sales to sort of ratchet it down the expectations on buybacks or dividend increases?", "Mark McAndrew", "Again we haven\u2019t run our actual cash flow projection for next year. There\u2019s no doubt that the more we increase sales, it does have some impact on what your stats are earnings. Although I would point out that at Globe we are continuing, for example on our insert media, I said the response rates were up but we still spend less money in the first quarter, then we did it in the first quarter a year ago, so that\u2019s a nice thing in that particularly at Globe and Direct response where we are seeing growth in sales so that\u2019s going to a growth and level our expenses.", "Gary Coleman", "Well I would add is that Colin we have seen the growth in the statutory earnings in the past to be about 6% or 7% with the new sales of the American Income. It's not going to drive it down them that much. We are still be running in 5% range.", "Colin Devine - Citigroup", "Just a final one, we haven't talked about first command in a long time. Has there really been any change to your outlook there or it's just going to slowly continue to shrink for a while?", "Mark McAndrew", "While we visited with them here this last quarter. They are optimistic that they will see turnaround in the military market place and we haven\u2019t included any turnaround there. We are including in our guidance for sales continue to balance the first quarter level for the balance of the year", "Operator", "Paul Sarran with Macquarie has a follow up question", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie ", "Two quick questions. A few years ago ran into some problems after floating too many agents and management pulled too quickly resulting in some lower productivity and higher agent turnover. Is there anything that you learned from that experience that will help you when you go to rebuild Liberty National now, is there any specific difference?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, you are not coming across, perfectly clear but sure that we learn lessons from that absolutely, that's why when I talk about, will the turnaround there be dramatic, will it be quick, no it will take some time. That's why I think a year to two year timeframe is more reasonable, and because we did learned a lesson, we have standards for promoting people in the management which we are going to stick with, and as we turn that company around, we want the growth that we achieve to be sustainable.", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just I'll try and speak up. One unrelated follow-up question. Could you just run through the RBC numbers you gave earlier again, total adjusted capital and prior capital if you have it and the impacts of temporary changes?", "Mark McAndrew", "Take that Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "What I had mentioned earlier is its year in '09 our adjusted capital was $1.5 billion, [1.476 billion] and the required capital is $416 million which gave us the 355% ratio and that ratio would give us excess capital $225 million over the 300% that we have managed during the past also mentioned as a $225.70 million gain from the increase in deferred tax benefits was allowed this year so excluding that the growth in excess capital $155 million and I said that, that could grow another $90 million this year assuming no impairments, and downgrades over the last three quarters because our statutory income is going to exceed what we will dividend out and insurance companies to the parent", "Paul Sarran - Macquarie Research", "And you don't have an update of required capital at first quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Well I do , the ratio was more to 340% level but I mentioned also earlier the reason for that is we had more in terms of dividends required to be paid of the companies then what we received in income in the first quarter but that will reverse in the second quarter and where the dividends will be lower than the income coming in, so we will be right back at the 355% level.", "Operator", "Next we will take a follow up question from Ed Spehar, Banc of America.", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Mark, I was wondering back on the Medicare advantage dis-enrolment possibility and the CMF numbers which you cited which would say that there\u2019s a $7 million plus seniors that could be coming into traditional Medicare, can you help us a little bit with how to think about that number versus what happened at the beginning of the 2000 I guess, 2000 may be 2001 period, and how to think about may be if I look at your med supp sales now, how many millions of how many seniors you are adding each year something to give us sense of how to think about that number?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, that\u2019s something we had actually we went back and we looked at the last time that was significant number of Medicare, it's an old release because I had the same question Ed , back in around 2008, we were picking it up look like roughly 3% of the dis-enrollees was basically the share that we were picking up. That\u2019s probably not an unreasonable number going forward. So, I guess that\u2019s about as good as I need to hear. Now when those dis-enrollees will occur, it\u2019s a still guess, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m kind of loving it. I don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to pick up roughly the same percentage we picked up last time, we sent a significant number of dis-enrollees.", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Okay. So then Mark, I guess the follow-up would be if you look at your level of Medicare supplement sales now, how many seniors are you selling business to kind of today at an annual basis?", "Mark McAndrew", "Ed, I don\u2019t have numbers right in front of me, but we can get those numbers for you, right now, we\u2019ve seen a little up-tick in our individual Medicare sales but nothing significant. I think there\u2019s a number as far as premium item website as far as where the Medicare sales are. We can get you some insured accounts if you like to add.", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "Yes. I guess just to try to put in perspective so if you were somehow able to pick up 210,000 people or something, what that would mean?", "Mark McAndrew", "I don\u2019t know what our average premium is today but the last I looked at it was something in excess of $2,000 per sale, so the average premium, so it's not going fall of that from number. ", "Ed Spehar - Banc of America", "What were your med supp sales kind of running at now?", "Mark McAndrew", "I have got that here somewhere, well I don\u2019t have it right in from of me Ed. Again its our Medicare segment sale, I will split out on an exhibit on website.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no questions in the queue. I will turn the conference over to our host for any closing or additional remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, that\u2019s all of our comments for the day. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and we will see it next quarter. Have a good day.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our conference call.

Please note that this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2009 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the third quarter was a $132 million or $1.63per share, a per share increase of 10% from the year ago. Net income was a $115 million or $1.41 per share, a 16% increase.", "Net income for the quarter was reduced by $31 million as a result of a GAAP loss on our pending sale of the United Investors. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.7% and our book value per share was $47.92, a 12% increase from the year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value was $52.77 per share.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 5% to $417 million and life underwriting margins increased 8% to $115 million. Life net sales were $79 million, down 7% from a year ago, our first down quarter in two quarters.", "Life first year collected premiums however were up 8% to $61 million, significantly better than our 3% growth in year-to-date sales and reflected of improving persistency.", "At American Income, life premiums were up 11% to $142 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $47 million. Life net sales increased 5% to $34 million. The producing agent count was 4,065, up 3% from a year ago, but down 3% from last quarter.", "The renewed growth in our producing agents at American Income is taking longer than we previously anticipated. In addition to changes in our management incentive compensation, we are working on growing our middle management ranks as well as improvements in our sales lead volume inflow. We expect it will take another two to three months to see the impact of these efforts.", "We are also in the fourth quarter beginning to implement a centralized recruiting call center for both American Income and Liberty National, which we believe will significantly increase our recruiting activity at both companies.", "In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $142 million, and life underwriting margin grew 8% to $36 million. Life net sales declined 3% to $32 million.", "The sales in Direct Response were again less than anticipated as response rates in our insert media segment continued to fall during the summer months. For the June to August time period, the response rates were 14% to 17% less than a year ago. For the last 60 days however, we have seen some improvement with the response rate lagging only 3% from last year.", "Due to other positive developments in our testing and modeling, we expect to see mid-single digit growth in life sales in Direct Response for 2011, despite these lower response rates and our insert media.", "Life sales at Liberty National declined 2% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $16 million. Net life sales for the combined Liberty National United American agency declined 19% to $11.4 million. Although, first-year collected life premiums were flat at $8.6 million, again reflecting improved persistency.", "We are beginning to see an upturn in our recruiting activity at Liberty National as a result of our implementation of the recruiting call center which I previously mentioned. For 2011, we currently anticipate 10% to 15% growth in net life sales at Liberty National.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 5% to $189 million, while health underwriting margin grew 2% to $37 million. Health net sales decreased 29% from the year ago to $13 million, but first year health collected premiums increased 11% to $20 million.", "While official numbers are not yet available, the contact person at CMS has resonated that roughly 900,000 Medicare Advantage participants will be disenrolled at the end of this year and which would be a 50% over last year. We believe we are in significantly better positioned than we were a year ago to capture a share in these disenrollees.", "Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $53 million, a 10% increase, while the underwriting margin was $6 million, down 4%. Part D sales grew 128% to $7 million for the quarter and first year collected premiums were up 83% to $13 million.", "Our administrative expenses were $38.4 million for the quarter, up 5% from the year ago. This increase is primarily the result of continued high employee healthcare costs.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. As disclosed, we entered into a contract in the third quarter under which Liberty National will sell its solely owned subsidiary United Investors to Protective Life. The sale was expected to close on or before December 31st, 2010 at which time the final sales process will be determined based on the advanced statutory capital and surplus of United Investors. Any numbers discussed here regarding the sale represented as if the sale had closed on September 30th.", "Prior to closing, United Investors will distribute approximately $327 million to Liberty in the form of dividends. At closing, Liberty will receive approximately $344 million from Protective, resulting in a statutory gain of approximately $190 million pretax or a $124 million after-tax.", "The $327 million of pre-closing distributions consist of a $188 million of Torchmark preferred stock, a $132 million of fixed maturities, and approximately $7 million of other assets and liabilities.", "The fixed maturities consisting primarily of the low investment grade bonds were excluded from the sale, because we did not want to sell them at a loss. We expect to hold them and receive full value and maturity for all these bonds.", "Although the sale generates a statutory gain, we are recognizing a GAAP loss of approximately $35 million or $31 million after-tax, and that\u2019s due primarily to the BAC, goodwill, and the difference in GAAP and staff benefit reserves.", "We expect the sale to result in approximately $15 million of lost income after-tax in 2011, $25 million of foregone United Investors earnings, offset by $2 million of investment income on the sales proceeds, if all the proceeds are invested at 5.5%.", "However, due to the sale, Liberty National should be able to increase its dividends to the parent company by $250 million to $320 million in 2011, to the extent of sales proceeds, our dividend to the parent, [inaudible] investment income will be less than the $10 million.", "For the remainder of my comments, any reference to investments from continuing operations may include the bonds that will be received in the pre-closing distribution.", "Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investments as well as excess investment income, capital and share repurchase.", "First, the investment portfolio. On our website, there are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30th. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $10.9 billion, including $10.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.", "Of the fixed maturities, $9.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $822 million, 7.9% of fixed maturities compared to $832 million at the end of the second quarter and $946 million a year ago.", "Again, we expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 7.9% is still high relatively relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 21% which is slightly less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago.", "During the quarter, we recognized $5 million of after-tax realized gains. For the nine months, we had net realized capital gains of $6.7 million after-tax.", "We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $572 million compared to net unrealized gains of a $143 million at June 30 and net unrealized losses of $4.2 million a year ago. The increase in the unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to the decline in both treasury yields and credit spreads.", "Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $447 million in investment grade of fixed maturities primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.6%, an average rating of A-, and an average life of 23 years to 25 years.", "For the nine months, we invested $1.4 billion at an average yield of 5.9%. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.68% compared to 6.74% earned in the previous quarter and the 6.96% earned in the third quarter 2009. The decline in yield is due to investing a larger than normal amount money at lower yields.", "In the last 12 months, we invested over $2 billion at an average yield of 5.95%. This unusually higher amount of money invested in that period was due to the third quarter 2009 portfolio repositioning to reduce low investment grade bonds and investing money that was previously held as cash for liquidity purposes. As of September 30th, yield in the portfolio is 6.66%.", "Now turning to excess investment income. Excess investment income is the net investment income less interest cost on the net policy liabilities and the financing cost of our debt. In the second quarter, it was $75 million, up $9million or 14% from the year ago.", "The year-over-year comparison of each component is as follows. First, net investment income was up $13 million. This represents an 8% increase in income, slightly higher than the 7% increase in average invested assets. Despite lower yield in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at a higher rate in the related assets, because we\u2019ve got significant more cash and short-term securities in the third quarter 2009 than we have in 2010.", "Next, the interest cost on net policy liabilities increased $6 million or 8% in line with the 8% increase in the average liabilities. And lastly, financing costs were down $1.6 million due primarily to the maturity of an $99 million issue in mid third quarter of 2009.", "Regarding RBC, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at around 325%. This ratio was lower than some of our peer companies, but it is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent and statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and our ratings.", "At yearend 2009, the RBC ratio was 355%, and adjusted capital was approximately $125 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We estimate that the ratio at September 30th is around 350%. However, we estimate that RBC at the end of the year will be somewhere around 400%, due to the impact of the sale of United Investors. Net of the proceeds from the sale will be dividend to the parent company until 2011.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the third quarter, we spent $66 million to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares. For the nine months, we have spent a $141 million to acquire 2.7 million shares.", "At September 30, the parent company had liquid assets of $220 million. In addition, we expect to generate another $50 million of free cash flow in the last three months of the year. Considering that we plan to maintain the liquid assets of around $200 million, this leaves $70 million of cash available for use in the fourth quarter.", "For 2011, in addition to the $200 million of liquid assets, free cash flow at the parent company was expected to be approximately $590 million to $660 million, assuming no more impairments in the remainder of 2010. This consists of approximately $340 million of free cash flow from normal operations along with $250 million to $320 million resulting from the sale of United Investors.", "Now free cash flow generated by the United Investor sale depends on how much cash will need to be retained in the insurance subsidiaries to maintain our consolidated RBC ratio at around the 325% level.", "As noted before, we will use our cash efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.", "Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, and we\u2019d like to address a question that came up on the last call, the question was in light of low interest rate environment, what would be the impact on product processing if we lowered the assumed interest rate.", "As we discussed on the last call, we are not creating policy of our accounts on our live policies. The GAAP interest rate and the discount rate that we use to calculate the GAAP reserves and it\u2019s also the rate that we use in our pricing. For most policies issues since 2000, the weighted average rate has 6.75%. However the weighted average discount rate on all policies for us is around 5.6%.", "The new money rate on third quarter investments was 5.6%. The lowest it has been in five years. If we felt that interest rates were going to remain at that level for a long period of time, we would likely reduce our GAAP and pricing interest rates.", "For illustration purposes, if we lowered our GAAP interest rate and processing rate to 100 basis points, we can maintain the current underwriting margins by increasing premiums on new business by just 1% to 3% for most of our product lines.", "To illustrate the magnitude of such a change, a 2% increase in premium on our due to the whole life business would average about $0.14 a month and a 3% increase in our American Income Whole Life business would average about $0.75 a month. We don\u2019t think that such premium increases will have a significant impact on new sales. However, we don\u2019t have any current plans to make changes to the GAAP interest rates as we don\u2019t expect the new mid yields remain to this low for an extended period of time.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. As Gary mentioned, we are proceeding with the sale of United Investors and expect it to close by the end of 2010. Assuming we use between $250 million and $320 million of the proceeds from this sale to repurchase shares, we anticipate a small dilution of our earnings per share for 2011 of roughly $0.05 a share, followed by an accretion of $0.10 to $0.20 for 2012 with additional accretion in subsequent years.", "And our guidance first for the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect earnings per share to be between a $1.66 and a $1.70, so we are raising our 2010 guidance to a range of $6.38 to $6.42. For 2011, we expect earnings per share to be between $6.75 and $7.10 per share, assuming that we spend between $590 million and $640 million on share repurchase. This guidance is lighter than normal due to our uncertainty concerning the timing and price of this share repurchase.", "Those are my comments for this morning. I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thank you. I had a question on your \u2013 just your comments on Liberty National Sales. I think you mentioned you expect sales to be up 10 to 15% in 2011. They\u2019ve been 20% plus for the past several quarters, so I just wanted to get an idea of what gives you confidence that things will improve there? And then the other one just on the agent count at Liberty National and American Income as it\u2019s down this quarter, wanted to see what was driving that, was it more changes in agent compensation and was there anything related to midlevel management, if you can just give us some detail on that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, well first we\u2019ll start at Liberty National. One of the things Jimmy obviously we\u2019re going to have a much easier year to compare again next year. If you look in 2009, we had $46 million of life sales of Liberty National where this year we expected to be down closer to $36 million.", "So even though we\u2019re expecting to see growth going forward next year, it really doesn\u2019t quite get us back to the level of sales we were in 2009, but we do expect to see 10% to 15% growth over the current levels. So I believe we are moving forward there. We have seen an improvement in our recruiting activity. So I mean those aren\u2019t build increases.", "As far as the agent counts, at American Income, the plateau we\u2019ve kind of hit in our agent count was a little more involved than what I had originally thought it was. Though, we have made some changes in management incentive compensation, but also and looking we really haven\u2019t significantly grown our middle management, which for the people that are doing the training of these new hires.", "So the even though our recruiting activity was up, we really just had more people there to train those people, and also a late flow in some areas, really it hadn\u2019t grown the support in the increased number of new agents. I am encouraged that we have started again this call center to actually be calling on Internet resumes.", "And the initial results we\u2019ve seen there as we\u2019ve gotten a very higher response as far as people wanting to come in and be interviewed. But it also involves \u2013 we\u2019ve got have more people there to train and we\u2019ve also got to do a little better job in some areas of increasing our lead flow.", "So we\u2019re working on all those things. So I\u2019m optimistic that \u2013 actually in September we started to see some turnaround there, but it\u2019s \u2013 I really think it\u2019ll be first quarter before we see the full impact of the things we\u2019re working on.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then you mentioned the potential for growth in Med Sup because of net advantage Med Advantage disenrollments. What\u2019s your view if like could this reverse the Republican\u2019s gain control of the House and/or the Senate?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, it\u2019s \u2013 I will first say that in our guidance we haven\u2019t assumed any significant increase in our Medicare Supplement business. It\u2019s hard to say. We think if \u2013 obviously if the Republicans take control of the House, things will be a lot more just basically stagnation which isn\u2019t all bad. But it\u2019s just too early to say what impact it will have in some of the Healthcare Reform Legislation.", "I think the \u2013 I think it\u2019s too early. You will see those disenrollees, they\u2019ve already been filed with CMS, you will see those disenrollees this year, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that change. But as far as what will happen down the road next year and the year after, it\u2019s hard to say at this point. I think the number of disenrollees this year is pretty well been set.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then lastly, you\u2019ve had historically I think 2% or 3% shares that you have picked up when there have been disenrollees and we should \u2013 is that something consistent with that for next year?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I would say \u2013 I have said in the past, in the last big round week, we picked up roughly 3% of the disenrollee. I don\u2019t know whether we can expect to pick up quite many. In this round one, we have far fewer capital agents who are in that market place, even though we feel like our product pricing puts us in a better competitive situation. I think most of what we do pick up a bit more in the general agency side of the business, but I wouldn\u2019t expect to pick up right now.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Paul Sarran with Macquarie.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Good morning. Just I guess first on guidance, can you share what the assumed new money yield is? And then also anything on margin and consistency in 2011 as compared to 2010 where both of those have been relatively strong metric so far this year?", "Mark McAndrew", "Gary you want to \u2013 well, we\u2019re assuming 5.5% in money interest rate on our guidance, Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s correct.", "Mark McAndrew", "And as far as persistency, I don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not. We\u2019re expecting \u2013", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Anything you\u2019re seeing like stronger or weaker than what it\u2019s been so far this year.", "Mark McAndrew", "I\u2019m sorry what?", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Just maybe directionally stronger or weaker about the same as 2010.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, in our guidance we\u2019re not expecting any significant changes in our persistency. Although in most of our lines of business we are seeing improving trends in our persistency, we haven\u2019t assumed any significant improvement in our persistency as far as our guidance.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then on American Income, if you\u2019ve gave it, I may have missed it. But did you give you expected sales growth for next year?", "Mark McAndrew", "I don\u2019t think that I did. But in our guidance we are expecting 10% to 15% growth for American Income.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "And what kind of agent count growth would you need to see for that to be achievable?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, historically assuming that would be roughly the same. Over a year\u2019s time, we would need to grow our agent somewhere in the \u2013 maybe a little bit higher because our first year agents are not quite as productive. So we will probably be more in the 15% to 20% growth in agents for the full year to achieve that.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then maybe one more, just on the recruiting call center, can you give any kind of maybe just grab a little bit more how that will work and how it interacts with the two companies?", "Mark McAndrew", "Sure. We\u2019ve done some testing where actually \u2013 well, I\u2019ll give you just a little bit of history, we started 10, 12 years ago with Internet recruiting with Hot Jobs, Monster. And initially we just ran ads and we got responses to the ads. And that was a good source of recruiting inexpensively.", "We later a few years ago, I guess it\u2019s been five to six years, we started a program where we started selecting resumes off of that database and sending emails to these people who are asking if they would be interested and coming to work for us. That increased our response and our potential candidates, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but substantially. We got far more responses to that than we did to our ads.", "And now, recently, we\u2019ve done testing doing automated phone calls to selected resumes in addition to the email, and again the response \u2013 what we\u2019d do is we would send an automated phone calls from people to selected resumes and if they wanted to schedule an interview it was automatically transferred to a live person.", "Well in our tests, a live person was in the local sales office and in the offices that we use it for our both companies, we\u2019d basically overwhelm them with calls. So actually what we\u2019re working on now is a centralized place where those calls can come into to where we can schedule the interviews, so that we can better handle the volume and just have better control over it.", "But initial results are very encouraging and it\u2019s something it\u2019s going to take us a while to expand that nationally in both companies, but it has a lot of potential to take our recruiting to a significant higher level. But again we got to have the middle management place to then recruit and train those people.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And then I guess maybe you\u2019re commenting to suggest that the issue with the agent counts is more turnover of newer agents than slowing recruiting, but can you just confirm if that\u2019s the case?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, American Income, it\u2019s been basically flat since the first two years. We feel the level of recruiting that we haven\u2019t been able to take it to the next level. And again that\u2019s \u2013 and even though our recruiting has been up somewhat, we\u2019ve seen a little higher turnover. But it\u2019s \u2013 there were number of factors involved there. Again we got to significantly increase the recruiting, we got to have more people there in place to train those people. And with that all, we\u2019ve able to generate a new source of leads for those people to work on. And again we\u2019re working on all of those things.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Hi, good morning, guys. I think I got a couple here. First, Mark you made a statement in your prepared remarks that you thought you were in better position to capture the disenrollees this year than last year. I was wondering why that was, what has changed?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, midyear, we did is reprice our Medical Supplement products as well as introduce some new plan, which I think puts us in a better competitive situation particularly in the general agency world, which is driven by price. So in that regard, we are in better competitive situation in the general agency and the general agency distribution world with our current products and pricing what were a year-ago.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, fair enough. And then just on direct response, I don\u2019t know that you touched on this, you did mention that your response rates were much slower in June \u2013 in June and August again there is a little bit of a lag there. They had gotten better. What was \u2013 what do you think the issue was and did you do something to make them better or did they just trying to get that on their own?", "Mark McAndrew", "That is \u2013 and I have mentioned this in the past, the insert media portion of our direct response is that all only a certain of our business that we\u2019ve see any indication that the economy has had an adverse effect. And we were surprised by the decline in the response and there is no good reason for it other than the economy. And they have come back. But we\u2019re always doing things to improve what we do.", "So again, even in our assumptions from next year, we\u2019re expecting a mid-single digit growth in sales, but we\u2019re not assuming that the economy is going to improve or that those response rates are going to improve on their own. If they do, we hope to see better growth than what we\u2019re using in our guidance. But I think we\u2019ve been fairly conservative in our estimates for next year as far as sales.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, just as a follow-up to that, then the response rates that you are assuming in the guidance are kind of these slightly improved as opposed to the June to August numbers, is that correct?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, we\u2019re not assuming as bad as that we were in the June to August period.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "But better, still less than what we\u2019ve historically I think.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay. And then, Gary if you can just confirm something for me, the \u2013 if you take the proceeds in capital that you\u2019re getting out of UIL, and invested at \u2013 I think you said at 5.5%, the dilution from the sale would be $0.20, but then if it is used for share repurchase, the dilution would only be $0.05 for 2011, is that correct?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, it seems that $0.05 is correct. What we were saying is that if we invested all the money, that the dilution would be $15 million and that\u2019s roughly $0.20.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Yes, [that will get to this].", "Gary Coleman", "(inaudible) Yes, that\u2019s right. That would be \u2013 the higher side of the $0.20, if we invest (inaudible) as Mark indicated the $0.05 if we use it for share repurchases.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, and then it becomes accretive in 2012, I haven\u2019t done my 2012 numbers yet, but what is the driver there? I guess it\u2019s \u2013 that will all be done? Is that the deal as opposed to maybe repurchasing over time?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I think it\u2019s a fact that in 2012 we will get the full benefit of repurchase because they will be done, you know, throughout the year, and we will get full effect in 2012. And also the amount of the income that United Investors would have provided in 2012 will be less than what it was in 2011.", "Mark McAndrew", "That\u2019s basically run-off like a business\u2026", "Gary Coleman", "Right. Each year that was earning a little bit less, then that revenues will be less going forward. So, that\u2019s one reason that will continue to be accretive in years to come.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Good morning. First of all, I just wanted to confirm, you talked about the share repurchase assumption, kind of guidance. Did you say 590-640? Is that recent?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, and then I think Gary just touched on this, but given that much share repurchase, I guess the timing is pretty critical. Should we think about a big chunk early because of the United Investors cash and the rest to kind of [stay just] to the year, how should be think about timing?", "Mark McAndrew", "Jeff, in our guidance, so we assume is the normal free cash flow, the $340 dollars that we expect. That will be spread throughout the year. The $250 million to $320 million (inaudible) that\u2019s going to come, that will be able to be passed to the holding company in late March. And we are assuming that money will be spent starting like a last week of March through the month of April.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay. And if that\u2019s the share repurchase budget, then I guess that contemplates that the $200 million cushion basically would remain in place. Can we think about that at some point potentially be drawn down?", "Mark McAndrew", "You know as far as our guidance go, we did assume this is going to stay in place, but you know that\u2019s our feeling now that we should have that cushion and that could change either \u2013 I am sure will have some migration that we might change the dollar amount, but as far as the guidance go we assume that it stay at the $200 million.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay great. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Edward Spehar with Banc of America.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Thank you, good morning. You know, Mark and Gary, I think you\u2019ve given a lot of information out on sort of what\u2019s underlying the guidance. It seems like maybe more than you\u2019ve given in the past. So, I guess I am going to push for a little more. Can you give us some sense of what type of premium growth \u2013 earned premium, not just sales, but what type of premium growth? I mean is this just sort of still kind of 2-3% type of premium growth type of expectation?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, I guess a little skewed because of\u2026", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "On an adjusted basis, I guess, adjusted for that.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I\u2019d have to \u2013 It\u2019s \u2013 it would be similar \u2013 yes, hold on. Actually I have it with \u2013 I can say including United Investors \u2013 including it in the 2010 numbers, but pulling it out of 2011, we still expect to see United premiums roughly flat with 2010. So, I guess that would be maybe about 4% growth, if you pull United Investors out of the 2010 numbers.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "But in terms of \u2013 I guess when we are thinking about the overall, I understand that the life is more profitable than the health, but the health is coming down. So life is going up. If everything works as you would hope it would in terms of your marketing efforts and let\u2019s say we get some benefit from the disenrollment over the next few years. What type of \u2013 what type of topline growth do you think you can get from your collection of businesses?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well Ed, you know again if we can continue to grow our life sales, we should see \u2013 we are growing life premiums at 5% rate. Now we should be able to see some, gradual acceleration of that. You know, just think how long and how much we can \u2013 how fast we can grow those sales. You know, again the numbers I\u2019ve been giving out, those are the numbers at the midpoint of our guidance. We\u2019ve obviously calculated the range of sales and premium growth. You know, it\u2019s \u2013 we have such a big [broad] life business here that new sales really has not been of much impact, as you are aware of. So, as far as next year, could we grow at 6%? Sure, we can grow from 5% to 6%. Can we grow from 5% to 10% growth in life premiums next year? No. Can we get there in three years? We could if we continue to \u2013 if we can continue to grow our life sales, but that takes [little] amount of time. But the other thing I would \u2013 I think we sometimes focus too much on sales, maybe as I mentioned in my comments and not the first year collected premiums. You know, our first year collected premiums \u2013 we have improved our first year \u2013 our persistency of the business. I think the first year collected premium is a much better indicator of what\u2019s going to happen to your future premium growth and as long as we continue to improve our persistency, and continue to outpace the growth in sales, with growth in first year collected premiums.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Just on the health side, Mark, is there any reason to think that the health business doesn\u2019t continue to come down over time?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I think we are getting close to. You know, our first year \u2013 even (inaudible) \u2013 okay the mix of the business is different. We put on a significant amount of group Medicare businesses here, which we expect to see that continue to grow, mostly in the fourth quarter and first quarter. But if you look at our first year collected premiums, on the health side, we have 11% for the quarter. I think we will continue to see \u2013 actually our new health premiums increased. Now, again it\u2019s going to take us a little while to get the total back up to flat but again we are persistency of the business that continues to fall off, but very poor persistency business, and very low margin business. So, no I don\u2019t think the health premium will decline much further than where it is now. I don\u2019t think we are that far off from at least having it flat, but with margins increasing, we are already seeing improvements in margin.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "But you would think, I mean is that a 2011 event or is that beyond? What do you think\u2026", "Mark McAndrew", "We are still at our midpoint. We are still expecting mid-single digit decline in our health premiums, although we are expecting to see small growth in our health margins for next year, but the midpoint of our guidance.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Eric Berg with Barclays Capital.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. Pardon me. A number of questions. First, Gary, with respect to your comment about a possible albeit unlikely discount rate cut underlying your gap reserves. If you were to do that, would that be what\u2019s called in the accounting literature a loss \u2013 the result of a loss recognition study? And if that were to happen, a discount rate cut, would that be just a direct hit to your book value as the liabilities on the right hand side of your balance sheet would all be restated upwards?", "Gary Coleman", "No not at all. That will only affect new agents.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "You are referring (inaudible) business.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes right. That\u2019s why again the total book of business, Eric, has only got a 5.6% overall interest rate, whereas the new businesses have higher rate. It would only affect new business and you know if interest rates continue where they are and if we continue to invest new money at below 6% in 2012, we very likely will make those rate adjustments then and change our interest rates, but we are going to give it a little more time before we make that decision.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. My next question relates to sort of your guidance and this announcement about share repurchase or at least is seems to be an announcement that we are [buying] share repurchase. It\u2019s actually unusual in the sense that most companies may when they tell us what their sort of authorization is and they say \u201cWell if we\u2019ve nothing better to do with the money, we will buy back stock.\u201d But you have sort of, I don\u2019t want to say, you\u2019ve committed to it, you\u2019ve expressed that this, I guess you are saying that this is your intent and am understanding that an intent is not a commitment. It\u2019s you desire, it\u2019s your intent. But why is this your approach to tell us that this is your intent? Is this another way of saying, for example, that you do not anticipate any acquisitions?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, what..", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Go ahead.", "Gary Coleman", "Oh, I am sorry, I\u2026", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I just wanted to say you could have just as easily said, \u201cWe have this money. You know we have a history of buying back our stock if we think that\u2019s the right thing to do, we\u2019ll do it but like many other companies you could have been silent on the issue instead you took the unusual step of saying we\u2019re going to take all this money from Protective Life and borrowing something extraordinary. We\u2019re going to buying back our stock. I find it noteworthy.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, one for us to give that guidance with the amount of cash that we\u2019re going to have available next year. We felt like we should and where we thought our earnings would be, if we do use it for share repurchase. Now we are always looking at opportunities for acquisition, I guess I don\u2019t \u2013 the way I look at it as any acquisition should be accretive to what certainly purchase would be. So that\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re not looking at acquisitions, while it means we\u2019ve very much interested if the right acquisition came along and that was a better use of the money, we would absolutely do it.", "But borrowing that, we wanted to make it clear that we don\u2019t intent to sit on $850 million of cash and invest it at 5.5%. We will find it better use for those funds than buying bonds, whether it be share repurchase or acquisition, but again the way we look at acquisitions is it needs to be accretive versus what buying back around shares would be.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And just explain the timing you provide into the sense that I believe you provided 2010 guidance in 2010\u2019s first quarter, haven\u2019t looked in the past where you\u2019ve done it, but this early for you to be providing the next year\u2019s guidance?", "Mark McAndrew", "No actually we provided at the same time last year Eric.", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, because I did see it in the first quarter as well.", "Mark McAndrew", "In prior years we did, but last year we decided we would move it up a quarter and started doing it at this time of the year.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And so you did it in the last year\u2026", "Mark McAndrew", "Just because we got so much flak from analysts that we can now provide it earlier. So we bound to your wishes Eric.", "Eric Berg \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, I appreciate it. I wasn\u2019t aware that to place it this time year. I thought it was a little later but in any case that was very helpful explanation. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Good morning. Torchmark is better than (inaudible) last night.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thanks for bringing us.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, you wanted to remind us that.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Sorry, Gary I\u2019m full and (inaudible). On the proceeds, you said you get it end of March and will use it all in April or begin using in April?", "Gary Coleman", "In our guidance we assumed that we would get it in late March. We would start in March buying back shares in our that we would buy the number of shares, there is a limit as to how much you can buy, so we would buy up to that limit and doing that, it would take us a full month, the last week of March, the full month of April to spend all that money.", "Mark McAndrew", "Bob, again I understand that that is the midpoint of our guidance. Now we have used different assumptions obviously at the low-end and the high-end of our guidance as far the timing and price of the share repurchase.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "This is the first time you\u2019ve used buyback and gains. Is that sort of seismic change that we should expect in the future or just one time because investors proceeds are so significant?", "Mark McAndrew", "It\u2019s hard to say but there is no doubt that part of it is because of the amount of cash that we\u2019re going to have available next year we felt that we should include it in our guidance.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "I agree. On the United Investors divestiture, you haven\u2019t spoken publicly on what drove the decision and believe me I think it\u2019s a great move and I\u2019m pleased with what you did but maybe you could articulate that why and specifically does this have any implications to your annuity block that\u2019s been sort of volatile and a nuisance in the past deck and to continue to be as volatile in the future?", "Gary Coleman", "No, not \u2013 obviously one of the big factors. Not just the annuities but there are some variable life business there that is really one of the profitability was definitely driven by how the equity markets performed and that was \u2013 that has been the most \u2013 the single most volatile piece of our business. So it was run off like a business, it was on a decline and has been on the decline for a number of years. It\u2019s very volatile piece of our business.", "And that the value will just continue to decline on and we felt like when we put it out we felt like we got a mega price for it. So all of those things, we think it was a good deal for us.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. You still had a little bit of annuities in the results, I mean the (inaudible) goes with it and just want to make sure you understand the..", "Mark McAndrew", "Bob, we have some annuities that were not United Investors as.", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s a fixed annuities.", "Mark McAndrew", "They are fixed annuities. And it\u2019s sold through banks. It\u2019s a very. It\u2019s not the volatile type business that the variable annuities that we had not invested for.", "Gary Coleman", "We have for some time written some fixed annuities, but.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "What\u2019s the size of the block Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay, I should we think we have about $900 million of reserves.", "Mark McAndrew", "I was thinking, it was just under $1 billion of assets.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I think that\u2019s right.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "And gains for administrative expenses for 2011?", "Gary Coleman", "Let\u2019s see. I have that here somewhere. Actually for administrative expenses we\u2019re expecting just about 1% increase at our midpoint.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "For next year.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "You\u2019re talking almost all the fund of being a Torchmark analyst for 2011 projections away but I appreciate it.", "Gary Coleman", "Well yes, and those are our midpoints. We obviously allowed from both ways from that but that\u2019s our best assessment right now.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Thanks, thank you very much.", "Gary Coleman", "You bet Bob.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Thank you. So just to change the topic from guidance. The 09-G issue was back. We had good commentary from Gary on the last conference call there that it was getting about 8% to 10% of book value. And I think there were still issues of kind of retrospective application of that and at least maybe some debate about how that affected Globe and so just was curious for any update on the 09-G in deck.", "Gary Coleman", "Okay Randy, first of all as far as Globe now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re referring to the growth response. The final rules did clarify that although it will be accounted for under SOP 93-7, it will still be considered deferred acquisition cost on the balance sheet. And there was some talk about that asset being amortized on a straight line basis, that was not put in to final guidance. So the DAC will for the Direct Response would still be able to defer what we\u2019re deferring and the amortization will be on the same method that we\u2019ve been using. So there is \u2013 the other good news is there is no change to the Direct Response.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "There is one change that was favorable. There was a consideration that not allowing deferral commissions pay to employees that was put in the final document. So we and that could have affected us at Liberty National. So that should have an impact there. As far as the estimates that I gave last time, that we were applied retrospectively and we could have a 8% to 10% reduction in equity by the adoption, that\u2019s we haven\u2019t refined anyhow, we\u2019re just in a positive sense \u2013 again started on getting the numbers together but as you remember we talked about the fact that on a go-forward basis, the earnings impact \u2013 whatever expenses that we won\u2019t be able to defer going forward. It should be offset by the fact that we\u2019ll have less amortization on the block and in addition to that we\u2019re going to the write-down that we take at the beginning will be recovered overtime as well.", "That\u2019s what we talked about last time and really nothing. We haven\u2019t changed those numbers at all.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then is the timing then 2012?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, 2012 which is really good because it\u2019s going to take a lot of work for all the companies to be able to adopt us.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "What do you \u2013 which would be Jan 1 2012, I mean what \u2013 is there any thought developing and that could slip again timing wise or is that still pretty hard date?", "Gary Coleman", "No I think that\u2019s hard date.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, I just wanted, just back there is one other thing on guidance I wanted to clean up. Given the large buyback component of the guidance, can you get buy that at the $10 million offset in kind of the UIL dilution number. You wouldn\u2019t get the $10 million offset because you wouldn\u2019t be investing that money in bonds, right, because it would be going up to go to buybacks. Is that correct?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s correct.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yes, okay very good. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take a follow-up from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James and Associates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Hey guys, just wanted to follow-up kind of where I think Eric Berg might have been drilling. The \u2013 with regards to the what were (inaudible) you repriced the anything that you sell, if you decided to do that so obviously your all good there. On the in-force business, so are you getting premium monthly, quarterly, yearly, however you\u2019re doing it. And the rate on that premium that you invested continues to go down. Is there any event, is there a reserve event or anything like that or is it just simply their reserves grow the way they\u2019re scheduled to grow and your interest income gets lower.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, Steven you\u2019re right. Reserves would continue to grow as they would but as we talked about before you\u2019re right we\u2019re collecting premiums monthly and annually but we\u2019re also collecting for a very long period of time. And that GAAP interest rate is again reserved for pricing, that\u2019s based on what we think we\u2019ll earn over 20 to 30 year period as we\u2019re going to collect significant cash flow from the policies.", "So yes we\u2019re low now, we have low interest rates at this point in time. But to use, we went back and looked at our 2000 \u2013 I think its 2005 issues, policies issued in 2005. The cash flow that we\u2019ve earned in 2010 on policies issued 2005, we\u2019ve only invested that 5.9% rate that we\u2019ve invested money in this year. But if you go back all the way to 95 when they were issued in all the cash flow that we received then, we\u2019ve invested that cash flow at over 7%. So we\u2019re \u2013 even though we\u2019re low this year, cumulative wise we\u2019ve invested at higher than the rate that we \u2013 price of it.", "So it\u2019s hard to look at one year. It\u2019s really got to be quite a few years low interest rates before it has an impact.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, let me ask you this then, we\u2019re going along, we Q2, we\u2019re sitting here at the same rate where we are today, nothing seems to be working. The economy is kind of punk. And Torchmark insurers decides that what this is Japan (ph) and this is where we\u2019re going to be and this is where we\u2019re going to be a long time. What happens then?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well again as we were explaining there, take for example American income. For us to have even if lowered our interest rates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "No, I\u2019m not talking about your new sales.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "I\u2019m talking about the in-force.", "Mark McAndrew", "Again.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "So if anything happen does reserves have to be taken up or anything like that? Are you just hearing what you heard on the cash flows and the reserves keep on going?", "Gary Coleman", "I think yes, that is not a reserve event.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, that\u2019s what I was asking.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James and Associates", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take a follow-up from Paul Sarran with Macquarie.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Thanks. I just wanted to approach the interest rate question I guess one other way. If a 100 basis point drop in the yield you assume for pricing, that would cause 1% to 3% increase in premium. Is it valid to kind of flip that around and say that a 100 basis point drop in your new money yield suggests that premium on your existing in-force business is 1% to 3% too low so that that\u2019s the maybe the long-term impact on profitability of your existing business?", "Mark McAndrew", "And when you say too low. If you look at for example American income where we have even after administrative expenses we have a pretax profit underwriting profit margin of 25% or better. If we lowered our interest rate assumptions there would those underwriting margins come down couple of points.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Maybe overtime as that.", "Mark McAndrew", "They would overtime but that\u2019s not that it would be unprofitable instead of a 25%, 26% underwriting profit margin. Again we may have 23% or 22% but it\u2019s not that it would be but the business is not so highly profitable.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Right, not unprofitable but that\u2019s the, I guess the drag caused by lower rates versus if rates stay higher?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well but again you had to understand that the entire block of business on the books we\u2019re crediting 5.6%. So we\u2019re \u2013 the yield on the portfolio is still substantially higher than that.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, yes I understand it. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Well thanks for joining us this morning everyone and we\u2019ll talk to you again in next quarter. Have a great day.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please note that this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel, and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2009 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $136 million, or $1.68 per share, a per share increase of 14% from a year ago. Net income was $155 million, or $1.91 per share, a 40% increase from $1.36 a year ago.", "For the year, net operating income was $526 million, or $6.41 a share, a per share increase of 7% over 2009. Net income per share for the year grew 29% to $6.30.", "Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.8% and our book value per share was $49.03, an 11% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 22% for the year to $49.86 per share.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $415 million and life-underwriting margin increased 5% to $115 million. Life net sales declined 5% in the quarter to 77 million, but finished the year up 1% at $330 million.", "Life first-year collected premiums were up 1% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $144 million and life-underwriting margin was up 12% to $48 million.", "Net life sales declined 7% for the quarter to 33 million, but grew 8% for the full year. On the last call, I mentioned several actions being taken to renew our growth in producing agents and sales at American Income.", "These initiatives are progressing and we should begin to see a turnaround in the first quarter. We have, however, reduced our growth expectations for new sales to the mid-single-digit range for 2011 at American Income.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $138 million while life underwriting margin was down 4% to $34 million. Net life sales were up 1% for the quarter to $31 million and grew 4% for the full year.", "With the difficult economic conditions, I\u2019m pleased with the 4% sales growth in 2010 at Globe Life. Barring another significant turndown in the economy, we now expect improved sales growth in 2011 in the 8% to 10% range.", "Life premiums at Liberty National declined 1% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $17 million. Net life sales declined 11% to $10.8 million for the quarter and were down 19% for the full year to $45 million.", "Much effort was given during 2010 to improve the underwriting margins at Liberty National. In addition to improving our persistency, significant rate increases were implemented during the fourth quarter on the life insurance portfolio. We also closed or consolidated a number of unprofitable offices during the year. While these changes were necessary, they did adversely affect our new sales. The negative impact of these changes are mostly behind us and we fully expect to see double-digit growth in our life sales at Liberty National in 2011.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $188 million, while health underwriting margin grew 3% to $35 million. Health net sales declined 49% for the quarter to $20 million and were down 33% for the full year.", "Most of the decline in health sales was in our Group Medicare Supplement business, which had an extremely strong fourth quarter of 2009. Also, the new business generated from Medicare Advantage disenrollees was disappointing, as 86% of those people dis-enrolled chose to re-enroll in another Medicare Advantage plan. After several years of decline, we now believe our health sales have hit bottom, and we expect to see single-digit growth in new health sales for 2011.", "Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $51 million for the quarter, a 15% increase. And the underwriting margin was $8.5 million, up 48%. For the full year, revenues were up 14% to $209 million, and underwriting margin increased 15% to $24 million.", "Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, an 11% increase, but rose 3.5% for the full year to $156 million. For 2011, we expect administrative expenses to increase in the 1% to 2% range.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. As previously disclosed, Liberty National closed the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary United Investors to Protective Life on December 31st, 2010. Prior to the closing, United Investors distributed approximately $305 million of assets to Liberty in the form of dividends.", "In addition, the proceeds from the sale are approximately $364 million, resulting in a statutory gain of $183 million pre-tax, or $119 million after-tax. Now, although the sale generated a statutory gain, we recognized a GAAP loss of approximately $35 million after-tax due primarily to DAC, goodwill, and the difference in the GAAP and stat benefit reserves.", "Now I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital, and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31st, 2010.", "As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.1 billion, including $10.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $9.6 billion are investment grade, with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds are $863 million, 8.3% of fixed maturities, compared to $824 million a year ago. Although the percentage of below-investment grade bonds at 8.3% is high relative to our peers, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 22%, which is likely less than our peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB-plus, same as a year ago.", "During the quarter, we recognized $18 million of after-tax realized gains. For the year, we had net realized capital gains of $24 million after tax. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $108 million, compared to net unrealized gains of $572 million at September 30th, and net unrealized losses of $455 million a year ago. The decrease in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to higher interest rates, with Treasury yields increasing more than credit spreads declined during the quarter.", "As far as investment yield, in the fourth quarter, we invested $314 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.8%, an average rating of A-minus and an average life of 27 to 29 years. For the year, we invested $1.7 billion at an average yield of 5.9%.", "For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.65%, compared to 6.68% yield in the previous quarter and 6.85% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31st, yield on the portfolio is 6.63%.", "Now turning to excess investment income. Excess investment income is our net investment income less the interest costs on the net policy liabilities, and the financing costs of our debt. In the fourth quarter it was $76 million, up $11 million, or 17% from a year ago.", "On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.94, up 21% over the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in excess investment income is due primarily to investment income being up $17 million over a year ago. This represents a 10% increase in investment income, compared to an 8% increase in average invested assets.", "Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, the investment income increased at a higher rate than the-related assets because we held significantly more cash and short-term securities in the fourth quarter 2009 than we did in 2010.", "Regarding RBC, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at or around the 325% plus level. This ratio was lower than some of the peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Although, we haven\u2019t finalized our 2010 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/10 will be in the range of 400% to 410%, higher than normal due to the impact of the sale of United Investors.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases, in the fourth quarter we used $62 million to buy 1.1 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $204 million to acquire 3.8 million shares.", "At December 31st, the parent company had liquid assets of $204 million. In addition, in the fourth quarter, Torchmark renewed its $600 million revolving credit facility through January 2015.", "In addition to the $204 million of liquid assets, we estimate that 2011 free cash flow at the parent company will be approximately $655 million. This consists of approximately $350 million of free cash from normal operations along with $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. To-date in 2011, we have used $74 million of this cash to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. For 2011, we are affirming the guidance we provided on the last call of expected earnings per share in the range of $6.75 to $7.10. This guidance assumes we spend between $600 million and $650 million on share repurchase for the year. I will also remind everyone that we expect the sale of UILIC United Investors to dilute 2011 earnings per share by about $0.05, followed by accretion of $0.10 to $0.20 per share next year with additional accretion in subsequent years.", "Those are my comments for this morning. I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Great, thank you. I\u2019d like to focus on the sales issue at American Income and I guess \u2013 I mean, Mark just a couple of questions. The first is, if you could kind of characterize what it is that\u2019s holding back sales there? I think we\u2019ve seen from other captive type agents and companies that it\u2019s harder to get folks motivated to take a bonus job maybe in this kind of macro environment. But if it\u2019s that or if it\u2019s something else, would be curious what it is that\u2019s been kind of challenging that? And what it is that you think might change, as it relates to your initiatives that could turn sales around there to single-digit growth?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, well, Randy, there\u2019s a number of things there, which we\u2019re addressing. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, part of the issue is growing our middle management. In order to recruit more agents, we need more middle managers who are kind of the frontline in recruiting and training of these people.", "We did see some growth there, I think we added four SGAs in the fourth quarter and 11 middle managers. That\u2019s not enough growth, but we\u2019ve started to at least turn the corner there and growing the middle managers. In some cases \u2013 in a few places it\u2019s a lead issue, generating more leads to supply additional agents and in the first quarter so far, our lead generation efforts have been pretty successful.", "There is one other thing, actually as far as the Internet recruiting sites, overall the total number of new resumes that were out on the three major sites actually declined last year, which doesn\u2019t \u2013 we have plenty of resumes out there to recruit from, but again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to look at; if that trend continues what other sources out of recruiting can we look at. So, it\u2019s really a combination of a number of things, Randy. We\u2019re moving forward, we are trying to centralize more of the recruiting effort to make it more efficient and to expand it, and I feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s just not something that turns around in a very short period of time. It\u2019s something that will be more of a gradual turnaround as the year progresses.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah, and it means, just to follow up there, does it feel a little bit different though than other downturns and I guess the answer has to be yes, right? And so is it feeling different this time around in this soft economic cycle?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I think, I do believe it\u2019s a short-term. We did see rapid growth over the last three years in our agent recruiting and our sales as a result of the downturn in the economy. That\u2019s kind of flattened out and now the unemployment rate is starting to come down, as I\u2019ve mentioned the number of new resumes out there have started to come down a bit so it\u2019s a little bit tougher environment than it was a couple of years ago, but there\u2019s still no reason we can\u2019t renew that growth this year.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "All right. I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Jeffrey Schuman with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Good morning. First want to just touch briefly on direct response. I think the benefit ratio there was a bit higher than we\u2019ve seen quite a number of quarters. Any concerns there of any emerging trends or it was just not a particularly favorable quarter?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, overall I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any particular trends there. We have some fluctuations there, so we did have a little higher than normal claims, but for the full year, the margins were about what they were in 2009 and we expect similar margins in 2011, so I think it was just an abnormal quarter.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "The other thing I\u2019m wondering about is this curious phenomenon of so many people being disenrolled from Medicare Advantage, and then somehow being absorbed back into the Medicare Advantage market. I guess I\u2019m wondering is what that sort of implies for the future of the insured product. I mean, if the insured product can\u2019t really claw back much market share in the face of that kind of disenrollments does it mean that maybe the Medicare Advantage is kind of permanently supplant it to you or how should we think about that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, Jeff, again, this is kind of a first round of disenrollments, and there were other Medicare advantage options available to people in these areas. Now, if \u2013 yeah, I think there is a big question mark right now especially with the change in the control of the House, will the cuts that were proposed previously continue over the next three, four, five years? If they do, you\u2019ll see the disenrollment accelerate and you\u2019ll see fewer options for people to move to, but I think it\u2019s a big question mark. We\u2019re not really projecting any significant growth there and really, right now, I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what the future of that is. We\u2019ll just have to kind of wait and see.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "And just one follow-up there. I don\u2019t know if you looked at the demographics, I\u2019m just curious. I mean, are people that have Medicare Supplement today older people that always kind of had that historically or do you actually still sell to new customers as they turn 65 and enter Medicare for the first time?", "Mark McAndrew", "Most of our new sales other than a group tend to be people turning 65, but again, there again, our new individual sales have declined to the point, it\u2019s not a significant amount and we did \u2013 we do pick up some people who are disenrolling from the Medicare Advantage plans, but you don\u2019t see a lot of replacement of business of other Medicare Supplement business.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thank you. Mark, I was wondering if you could give us an update on just your Part D enrollees for 2011. And then secondly, just maybe talk about the M&A environment, seems like you\u2019re committed to buy back, but I was wondering if you\u2019ve seen any properties potentially out there that you might be interested and is it reasonable to assume there is some chance that you\u2019d use the capital for a deal or is it mostly going to be used for buyback?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, well first off, our Part D sales were less than what they were a year ago, primarily in our Group side and we did lose a little, the auto enroll business we have. So, right now, we\u2019re expecting our Part D revenue next year to be down a little bit in the probably 7% range.", "Margins maybe slightly less than what they were this year, although they were surprisingly strong because of the volume of rebates that we received. So, we expect \u2013 in our guidance, we\u2019re expecting about a 7% decline in our Part D for next year.", "On the M&A side, in the guidance we\u2019re assuming we\u2019re using that cash for share repurchase, but we are actively looking at what\u2019s out there in the acquisition, as an acquisition candidate. There are some companies out there that are attractive to us, and the timing of something like that is hard to say.", "We don\u2019t feel pressure to make an acquisition, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re definitely going to be looking hard at this year, although we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re in a good position to make an acquisition in addition to buying back shares, so I wouldn\u2019t expect to use all of that cash in an acquisition, but I think the chances of an acquisition coming along this year are much better than the last two or three.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then lastly, on Liberty National, the margins are actually better than what we thought about. I think part of it is lower amortization. Is that \u2013 the margin this quarter, should we assume that\u2019s a run rate or was there something abnormal this quarter in that business?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, overall, the margins are improving at Liberty National. Again, we made some changes. We saw some negative changes in our persistency a couple of years ago that we had to react to and now that persistency has improved, which results in the lower amortization. So, we expect \u2013 overall we expect the margins for 2011 to be roughly what they were for the full-year 2010. But again, we\u2019re continuing to \u2013 we raise the rates on the products that we\u2019re raising. The new business we\u2019re writing going forward, definitely has a better margin than what we\u2019ve written in the last couple years.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Sarran from Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Hi, thanks. First question is on direct response. Sales did feel a little bit light in kind of the second half of 2010. So, want to ask what you saw in the quarter that caused you to raise your sales growth outlook for next year. It was I think mid-single-digits the list time you talked about it and now you\u2019re saying 8% to 10% or high single-digits I guess.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, I think I\u2019ve said on the last call, some of the response rates we saw a decline in the summer of last year did come back somewhat from where they were in the summer, which impacted our sales the second half of the year. But we\u2019ve really \u2013 we continue to test and we\u2019ve continued to find ways to be better. And again, just our response rates just pretty much hold where they\u2019re at with the additional things that we\u2019re pursuing we think that growth is very achievable. Part of it, we\u2019re exploring ways to better underwrite our products, which will add margin, which will have a positive impact on our mortality, which will allow us to expand our distribution. But there\u2019s a number of different things. There\u2019s a number of different pieces to that that cause us to have that optimism.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. And the price increases you implemented for Liberty. Can you talk about what drove that? Is it interest rate-related changes to your persistency assumptions or something else altogether?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, it just comes down to even \u2013 prior to that, the margins on the business at Liberty National were the lowest of any of our life distribution. And they had been deteriorating particularly. We have a lot of fixed expenses at Liberty National even though we\u2019ve been managing those pretty effectively. The margins we just felt weren\u2019t acceptable and we felt the need to increase the rates to offset those.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Do you think about in terms of return targets or required returns, did you change your return requirement or is it just with the shrinking distribution size on fixed costs, you have to raise prices to get back to the same return?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, it was mostly. The reason for the increases were basically just a rise in our acquisition expenses. Although it is something we are taking a look at now and we will make a decision before the end of the first quarter as to whether or not we\u2019re going to change our interest rate assumptions for 2011. We don\u2019t \u2013 we figured it both ways. We don\u2019t expect it to have a material impact on 2011 results regardless of what we do, so it is something we\u2019re looking very hard at, we will make a decision on our interest rate crediting before the end of the first quarter.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks. And then just one last one on health margins. The underwriting margin declined sequentially from 19.3% to 18.8%, and it had been kind of on a rising trend. And I think we\u2019ve talked about it in the past, we would have expected it to continue increasing given the ongoing mix shift away from the limited benefit product into more of Med Supp and supplemental products. So, is there any change in the trend here or is it kind of a one quarter blip or can you kind of just talk on that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, the decline in the margin is really still that underage 65 health insurance block and it\u2019s really the lapse rates are continuing to be high on that, and so we\u2019ve had to increase the amortization of the DAC. For 2011, we may see a slight decline in that margin but \u2013", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Sorry a slight decline in the overall health margin, or just for the under 65?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, in the overall, as a result of the under age 65.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Hi. Good afternoon. Most were answered. I just have one simple question now, and that has to do with the movement, just so I\u2019m clear. The movement in interest rates over the quarter and since that point, my assumption has to be that you\u2019ve gotten much closer even since the fourth quarter with being even up in terms of new money versus the effective yield, that would be correct, yeah?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Steven, we\u2019re so far through the first quarter, we\u2019ve invested a little over 6%, which is quite an improvement over the 5.8% in the fourth quarter, and 5.5% in the third quarter, but we haven\u2019t gotten back up toward the 6.5%, 7% range, but 6% is quite an improvement.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. That\u2019s really what I wanted to get to, thank you. As I said, the rest have already been asked.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Yes, most of mine have been answered as well, but just one question around buybacks. I think you alluded to taking the proceeds of United Investors and basically being in the market March and April putting to work all of the proceeds. Is that still the expectation, or has that changed at all?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, when I mentioned that on the last call, I said that that\u2019s the way we had done our guidance with that kind of assumption, we\u2019ve got \u2013 that money is going to be coming up March 15th, but as I mentioned, we\u2019ve already spent $74 million on share repurchases in 2011 to-date. You can continue to buy more. We have no set time. When we\u2019re going to buy those shares, we\u2019re really buying when it\u2019s an opportune time. Until that money comes up, if we need to, we can use our short-term line for just a short period of time, but we\u2019re not really pinpointing that we\u2019re going to spend that money at a certain point in time.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then, I apologize if I missed this, did you talk about when you were upstreaming dividends? Has that been done already?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, let\u2019s break it into two pieces. The dividends just related to our normal statutory operations this year are going to be right around $470 million. That $470 million will be spread evenly throughout the year. The $305 million that\u2019s related to United Investor sale, that will probably come up, as I mentioned, in mid-March.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. Please go ahead.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Well, the marketplace is giving you an opportunity today. How long do you stay out of the market when you report, or can you buy the day of report?", "Mark McAndrew", "We can buy tomorrow morning.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Tomorrow morning, you come back in?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. With the yields, I assume the price increase at Liberty National is motivated by the decline in interest rates. Is that fair?", "Mark McAndrew", "That is part of it, but again, as I mentioned, Bob, with all the fixed costs that we have there \u2013 as Liberty sales have declined, it has raised our overall acquisition costs, so it was something we felt necessary. The increase in acquisition costs was a big contributing factor.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. So, that maybe negates my question, but with rates \u2013 with earning above 6%, when you started this at 5.50, might you have overshot the rate increase, and if interest rates continue to climb, would you slow it down, or you\u2019re going to take them now that you\u2019ve got them and keep passing them through?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, we\u2019ve passed them through. Obviously, it\u2019s something we we\u2019ll give a good look at, Bob, but I can\u2019t imagine \u2013 sales would have to come up significantly and persistency continue to improve before we take a look at repricing them back downward.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. So, it\u2019s more a size of the business than interest rates, as far as a factor?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes. Right.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. On the Med Supp in the quarter, anything that spiked margins back to get you even for the year, it seems like it was well above \u2013 I know the fourth quarter can be some catch-up, but was there anything unusual in there?", "Mark McAndrew", "I don\u2019t know \u2013", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Part D I\u2019m talking?", "Mark McAndrew", "On Part D?", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Yes.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, there was on Part D. We were a little surprised. Most of that increase are rebates that we received based upon 2009 results, but we just finally settled up with our pharmacy benefits manager in the fourth quarter from the prior year, and also, we settle up with CMS for the 2009 results, and both of those were more favorable than what we had anticipated, so the 2010 experience, again, we won\u2019t really have final numbers until late this year, but we don\u2019t expect quite as good of total rebates as what we received in 2009, but again, it will be later this year before we know the exact numbers.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. And finally, is there anything in the AIG carcass potentially of interest or \u2013 I know American General was, at one point in the history bank \u2013 interest strike zone of Torchmark.", "Mark McAndrew", "That\u2019s a possibility. Yes. If that comes on the market, it\u2019s something we would at least definitely take a hard look at, Bob.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay, but doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s been anything yet. Thank you very much.", "Mark McAndrew", "Sure.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead. John, your line is open... John, your line is open.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Sorry, guys. The cord fell out of my phone. I had a couple for you. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. I think in your guidance for 2011, you guys have been talking about 10% to15% sales growth for Liberty, and I think as well for American Income. I may have missed this at the beginning, are you still on track for that? Frankly, I assume the comps, given the fourth quarter results, actually make that a little bit easier to achieve.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, now we\u2019ve lowered our overall \u2013 at American Income, we\u2019re now just assuming mid-single-digit.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "But at Liberty, we still think we can achieve something in excess of 10% growth in life sales there because we do have easier comparisons.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Okay. And then Gary, on the risk-based capital ratio, the 400 to 410 estimate, after the dividends you expect to make up to the parent, where does that come down to? Does it come all the way to your 325 target, or are you still somewhere above that level?", "Gary Coleman", "No, we would still be above it because at around 410% level we would have 350 million of excess capital.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Above the 325, okay, and the dividend\u2019s about 305?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Okay, got it. And then Mark, more maybe a philosophical question on thinking about deploying capital, but I\u2019m wondering if you guys have considered perhaps redirecting some of the extra cash flow or extra buybacks that you\u2019re doing, into maybe taking your dividend yield up, especially in a relatively low rate environment, perhaps a stock in my coverage universe that could stand out with a higher dividend yield. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys have considered that, would it make some sense, especially given the predictability of your cash flow.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, John, yeah. I mean, it\u2019s obviously something we\u2019ve considered. In fact, we\u2019ve talked with most of our larger shareholders about their preference.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "And basically, their attitude is they would prefer to use share repurchase. We feel like we\u2019re returning the money to our shareholders.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "One way or the other.", "Mark McAndrew", "One way or the other.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Yep.", "Mark McAndrew", "The thing about a cash dividend is it\u2019s very hard to reduce, and we have been increasing our dividend every year for the last few years and we intend to continue that, but again, we would like to \u2013 we want to be able to pursue acquisitions and if we get committed to too big of a cash dividend, I would hate to have to cut that at some point in the future in order to make an acquisition, or to \u2013 and to be quite honest, the bulk of our long-term shareholders prefer the share repurchase.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne", "Yeah, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Colin DeVine with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Colin DeVine \u2013 Citi", "Thank you very much. Let\u2019s get away from capital for a bit, and I was hoping we could just talk about what you\u2019re looking at in terms of maybe modifications to your products this year, if there\u2019s anything sort of coming down the pike?", "Mark McAndrew", "Collin, I don\u2019t see any major changes in our product portfolio. Again, we\u2019re going to continue selling basic protection products, barring an acquisition that we might get into another product line. We are looking into the possibility of \u2013 with some of our captive sales force, the possibility of selling some other products that we may not necessarily feel comfortable taking the risk on, but we do have a significant captive sales force there that there is the possibility we may offer some other company\u2019s products that don\u2019t directly compete with our own, but we don\u2019t envision any major new product lines.", "Colin DeVine \u2013 Citi", "Would those be insurance products, I assume, or other types of Financial Services?", "Mark McAndrew", "It\u2019s possible it could be either, but I would be thinking more insurance-type products and lines that we\u2019re not in.", "Colin DeVine \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, I show no further questions in queue.", "Mark McAndrew", "All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Torchmark Corporation first quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. Please note that this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast.", "At this time, I will turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the first quarter was a $129 million or $1.62 per share, a per share increase of 7% from a year ago. Excluding the $6 million of United Investors earnings from the year ago quarter, net operating income per share from continuing operations increased 12%. Net income was $106 million or $1.33 per share, down 13% from a year ago, primarily as a result of a $15.5 million dollar realized investment loss on the sale of our holdings in MBIA.", "Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.2% and our book value per share was $49.45 a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 15% to $50.70 per share.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding the United Investors grew 4% to $431 million and life-underwriting margins increased 7% to $119 million. Life net sales declined 5% in the quarter to $81 million, while life first-year collected premiums were down less than 1% to $61 million.", "I feel good about our potential for growth in our life premiums and underwriting margins. While we currently expect relatively flat life sales in the second quarter, we believe we will see high single-digit growth in life sales in the third quarter followed by double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. I am also very pleased with our initial efforts conserve our existing life customers.", "In 2010, we produced $330 million in net life sales, but we lapse $252 million at in force premium. As we are able to fully implement our conservation efforts over the next few months, we believe we can reduce our lapses in the 10% to 20% range. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to a $146 million and life-underwriting margin was also up 8% at $48 million.", "Net life sales declined 5% for the quarter to $33 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 4,039 down 4% from a year ago, but up 3% from year end. It is also up 8% from its low of 37, 24 at the end of January. I am very encouraged by the progress that we made at American Income.", "In addition to the growth and agents, the number of new agents achieving our top bonus level for the first time grew by 38% in February and March, which will have a positive impact on our new agent retention. Our mid level sales management ranks also increased 4% during the quarter.", "In our direct response operations at Globe Life, life premiums were up 5% to a $152 million, while life underwriting margins were unchanged at $38 million. Net life sales were down 2% to $36 million.", "The outlook for direct response is also very positive. For the past few months, we have been testing and analyzing an enhancement to our underwriting, utilizing applicants\u2019 prescription drug records and the initial results are encouraging.", "For our insert media adult business, which represents 40% of our total Direct Response life sales, we estimate this change will reduce our mortality cost by roughly 17%, resulting in additional underwriting margin of 4% of 5% of premium on this block of business. This additional margin will in turn allow us to expand our distribution. This change will also impact our direct mail sales, but further analysis is necessary before we can quantify the effect. We currently expect mid single-digit growth in life sales in the second quarter with improving double-digit growth in life sales in the second half of this year.", "Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 20% to $17 million. Net life sales declined 12% to $9.4 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the first quarter was 1,844, down 17% from a year ago.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, the turnaround at Liberty National is not a quick and easy fix, but we are making progress. The underwriting margins have improved significantly. Through our conservation efforts, we should stop the decline in life premiums.", "On the marketing side, the number of new agents achieving the maximum bonus level for the first time was up 34% in the first quarter, which again will have a positive impact on our agent retention. We have, however, reduced our life sales estimates at Liberty National for 2011. We now expect to see a continued decline in the second quarter followed by roughly flat sales in the third and single-digit growth in the fourth quarter of this year.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding part D declined 5% to $192 million. Our health underwriting margin grew 4% to $37 million. Health net sales declined 16% to $14 million. As a percentage of premium, we expect to help margins to hold at that 19% level for the balance of 2011. Premium revenue for Medicare part D was $49 million for the quarter down 5% and the underwriting margin was $5 million down 2%. Administrative expenses were $38 million up 2% from a year ago and inline with our expectations.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website we are prescheduled to provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31st, 2011.", "As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. As of the fixed maturities $9.8 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $758 million down from $863 million at December 2010 and $891 million a year ago.", "The decline in the first quarter was due to a $82 million of dispositions and also $24 million of net upgrades of bonds to the investment grade. The percentage of below-investment great bonds to fix maturities at 7.2% is the lowest that it has been since the second quarter 2008. That percentage may still be higher relative to our peers, however, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding OCI is 19.6% which is likely worse than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB-plus, same as a year ago.", "During the quarter, we recognized realized losses of $23 million pre tax or $15 million after tax. These losses resulted from the sales of the company\u2019s entire holdings as NBIA bonds which had a presale book value of $63 million. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $156 million, compared to gains of $108 million at year end 2010 and net unrealized losses of $185 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the first quarter is due primarily to the previously mentioned sale of NBIA bond.", "Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter, we invested $265 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invest at an average annual effective yield of 6%, an average rating of A-minus and an average life of 27 years.", "For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.62%, compared to 6.65% in the previous quarter and 6.78% in the first quarter of 2010. The decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31st, the yield on the portfolio is 6.61%.", "Now, turning to excess investment income, excess investment income is our net investment income less the interest costs on the net policy liabilities, and the financing costs of our debt. In the first quarter, it was $74 million, up $2 million or 3% from a year ago.", "On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.93, up [17%] over the first quarter of 2010. As a component, net investment income was up $8 million or 5% in line with the 5% increase in average invested assets.", "Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at the same rate as the related assets because we held significantly more cash and short-term securities during the first three months of 2010 than we have in 2011. The interest costs on the net policy liabilities increased $6 million or 7% in line with the 7% increase in the average liabilities.", "Now regarding RBC, as we mentioned before, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at or around the 325% level. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but it is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "At December 31st 2010, consolidated RBC was 421% and adjusted capital was approximately $385 million in excess of that required for the target 325% ratio. The ratio and excess capital were higher than normal due to the impact of the sale of United Investors on December 31, 2010.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first quarter we spent $187 million to buy 2.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April, we used $30 million to buy another 450,000 shares. For the full year, through today, we had spent $217 million of parent company cash to acquire 3.4 million shares.", "The available liquid assets of the parent consists of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations, free cash flow results from the derivatives received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the dividends pay to Torchmark shareholders and the interest paid on the debt. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $205 million. We expect to generate approximately $655 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus the total free cash available for all of 2011 will be around $860 million, the same amount that we projected in our previous call.", "In the first quarter, we generated about $391 million of our free cash flow and that included the $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. As mentioned, the parent used a $187 million in the first quarter for Torchmark share repurchases.", "As a result, the parent ended the quarter with $409 million of available liquid assets. And that\u2019s comprised with a $205 million ending asset plus a $391 million of free cash during the quarter less 187 million of share repurchases. Now along with the $409 million as on hand at the end of the first quarter, we should generate approximately $264 million of free cash flow over the next three quarters of the year.", "As of today, after deducting the $30 million of April share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $643 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible and if market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. First quarter earnings were in line with our projections and our previous guidance and we are affirming our guidance for 2011 of expected earnings per share in the range of $6.75 to $7.10.", "Those are my comments this morning. [Nalini], we will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Couple of questions. Mark, I was interested in your comments on conservation efforts as it relates to some of the business that lapsed or that I guess in elevated level of lapse station, could you maybe give us a little bit more detail on exactly what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, what \u2013 how you\u2019re going about that?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Sure. And it\u2019s not an elevated level. In fact our persistency of our life business is actually been improving over the last few years. So, it\u2019s not an elevated level of lapses, but number of months ago, we decided that we were really going to focus on trying to conserve as much of that business as possible and we have spent a lot of time over the last few months analyzing and tracing back to the source what is causing the lapses in our different distribution systems.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "And so \u2013 it\u2019s not one single thing that we\u2019re doing because there is a lot of different areas, but we have now identified where those lapses are originating and what the causes are and we\u2019ve outlined plan for each of those areas on what we can do to reduce those. Some of those changes in our procedures will be pretty quick to implement. I think achieving a 10% reduction in our lapse rate \u2013 in our lapses is something we can achieve in the next few months. To get to the 20%, that\u2019s going to take a little more time that things are need to test or people we need to hire and train as far as people who take phone calls and do some telemarketing. But I think over the next 12 months, I think something towards the high end of that 20% range is achievable.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. Okay. And then two more real quick ones. One is just on investment income the excess investment income, Gary, are you where you wanted to be as far as cash and liquid assets getting invested or is there still some marginal pick up we should expect?", "Gary L. Coleman", "", "We are pretty much invested. One thing though, it took a little bit longer in the quarter.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary L. Coleman", "To get the money invested, the markets are \u2013 is still little hard to find the bonds. But as far as within the insurance companies, I think we are now about 150 million of short term money which is not unusual.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. Okay. And then finally, just an update since there is I guess been a little bit more news recently now on DAC accounting changes, the deferral of certain costs or lack of deferral of certain costs that used to be deferred. Can you give us a sense for what your plans are there and how should we think about potential retrospective charge?", "Gary L. Coleman", "Well, we will definitely retroactively adopt and\u2026", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne \u2013 Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary L. Coleman", "I really don\u2019t have any much more add that we did last quarter, last quarter we talked about the fact that we think that are ride down to be somewhere between $300 million to $300 million dollars, which is after-tax, which is above 8% of our book value.", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne \u2013 Agee & Leach", "Okay.", "Gary L. Coleman", "But going forward, as far as the impact on earnings, we will have a negative in terms of reduced expenses that we can defer, but we\u2019re going to have a positive by the fact that we\u2019ll have reduced amortization.", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne \u2013 Agee & Leach", "Yeah.", "Gary L. Coleman", "And when you net those two, if we don\u2019t do anything else, we\u2019ll have a small positive, but there is about a $100 million of agency related non-commission expenses that meet the criteria for the deferral. We are in the process of looking at those expenses with first in mind to reduce those expenses, to cut what we can or reduce what we can. And then also there is a secondarily to that, is that we maybe able to recast some of those expenses to into commissions, which would be deferrable. To the extent that we can do those two things the deposit earnings will be even greater.", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne \u2013 Agee & Leach", "Okay. So the net impact here, at least, even if you can\u2019t accomplish that sort of work, is we should see the write down of DAC will reduce your future amortization enough that this is a modest positive on the earnings side?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "That\u2019s correct.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Yeah.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "John we\u2019ll have as Gary mentioned we have a reduction our book value, but corresponding increase on our return on equity, but also just want to reemphasize what Gary was saying. We are going just by each distribution system and taking a hard line by line and look at all of those expenses that are no longer going to be deferrable. And we will be very much concentrating on what we can do to reduce those expenses between now and the first year.", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay. And adoption date would be the end of this year, I think, right?", "Gary L. Coleman", "Yeah, it\u2019s a January 1st 2012, adoption day.", "John SecNadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach", "Okay, terrific. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Binner\t with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Great, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to clarify on the sales kind of guidance you gave us quarter-by-quarter. I just wanted to clarify that effectively the AIA American Income guidance and the direct response guidance that we had previously, which was mid single-digit, I think, at American Income, and kind of high single-digit at direct response. It sounds like that guidance is in place and it\u2019s only Liberty National that changed. Is that the correct interpretation?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s right Randy. We still \u2013 when you look at the full year\u2026", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "We still are expecting high single-digit growth and direct response and mid-to-high-single digit growth at American Income, but it\u2019s one of things that it will be accelerating each quarter as the year progresses in both of those distribution systems. We have lowered our expectations at Liberty a little.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "It\u2019s fair enough. And then so what you mentioned you got your sales manager, middle manager count up 4%, and I think that was maybe the key focus at American Income. And that\u2019s really the most important area to turn sales around. But what else is working there or is it all about sales managers? What else is working and giving you that confidence of the turnaround in sales there?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, there is two things there I mean growing the middle management is definitely important. And in fact we\u2019ve got some new incentives coming out June 1st that I think will add to that growth in our middle management. The other key thing when I look at last year, the percentage of our new hired agents who achieve that maximum bonus level, the first time was declining. And that\u2019s when I\u2019m saying the last two months have been very strong there, up over 30%.", "A number of new agents were hitting that bonus level because those are the people we retain. We\u2019ve seen agents who don\u2019t achieve that bonus level, we basically retain none of those people for a year. We have very good retention of the agents who achieve that bonus level. So that is we\u2019ve again we done some restructuring of our incentive compensation for management and really just have a renewed focus on doing a better job of training and working with agents to get them to that bonus level and that will pay dividend. Our new agent retention will improve.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "That\u2019s great. Very helpful. Keeping with sales real quick here, over to direct response. It sounds like the effective, the underwriting margin improvement that comes from using the prescription drug records, I guess that allows you to self-fund increased by distribution? Is that the way we should think of it? Just a little bit more color, too, on what's driving the more bullish comments at direct response?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "That\u2019s one of the number piece because that is an important piece. When we if on 40% of our sales where low in our mortality cost by 17%, it does allow more margin. One, we would do some additional rate test to again trying on the optimum pricing level. We know that it is very price sensitive. If that improvement in our mortality cost allow us to bring our rates down 10%, we seen from past experience that that will improve our response rates by something in that 20% range and also improve the persistency of the business resulting in higher profitability. So we\u2019ve also had some very successful package test, you are in the last three or four months that will add to that but those are number of factors in that, but there is no doubt the change in underwriting is a big piece of it.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yes, thanks for the responses.", "Operator", "We will take the next question from Ed Spehar with Bank of America.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, good afternoon. A few questions Mark. First, could you talk a little bit more about the health side. The first two collective premiums where down a lot more than I thought they would be, maybe that\u2019s just because I was just have to launch on the forecast. But I am wondering if you could give me some sense of what\u2019s going on in the health side and I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well Ed, there is a not a whole lot new to report from the last caller to you on the health side. Health sales were down a little more than what we anticipated and part of that was for example like American income and someone need to take a look at. We\u2019ve by moving to a laptop sales presentation I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve done a good job of trying to move some of the health products into that. Not something we can adjust but they come down to its pretty in line with where we thought we would be and borrowing we don\u2019t see any big resurgence in medicare at this point in time. So it\u2019s about in line with where we expected to be.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "So how should we think about that you know for looking at sort of the outlook over the next few years just generally, is that a business that continues to decline.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, again, Ed, you\u2019ve been following as long enough its hard to predict what the medicare certain marketplace will do. I think the Liberty National sales, as total sales stabilize and start to move forward those should not decline or should turnaround and same way with the American Income we can bring those back up, but as far as the other, we basically discontinued those underage 65 products. Until there is a major change in the medicare advantage, then I don\u2019t expect to see growth in our health premiums. I still think we\u2019ll see some improvement in our health underwriting margins as some of that business continues to run off, but I don\u2019t expect to see growth in our health premiums for the balance of this year or probably in the next year anyway.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I guess it\u2019s a good lead into my next question, you highlighting how long I\u2019ve covered this company, because I wanted to talk about Liberty National. And I think for as long as I\u2019ve covered the company, you guys have been trying to figure out how to turnaround that distribution channel in one way or another. And I\u2019m just curious, at what point, or is there a point, where that business is more valuable as just a run-off book than trying to just sort of turn it around?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "I don\u2019t know that we ever get there Ed, I mean it\u2019s still the business we generate, I mean if we ever got the point where the new business we generated was not giving us a reasonable return on investment then we would have to take a look at that, but we are not there and we don\u2019t expect to get there. So I haven\u2019t given up on Liberty, there is obviously a lot of challenges there, but again I think we can stop the decline through our conservation efforts and it will turnaround through the course of this year. Some of the things, well, it\u2019s so different from American Income and we\u2019re continuing to address the issues that arise, but I don\u2019t see it ever becoming just a run-off block.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Okay and just one final question. Could you just quantify, if you achieve a 10% reduction in lapse rates, what that equates to in terms of dollar amount of premium?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, again, you can look last year we lapsed $252 million of life premium, annualized premium. I think our projections for this year if we continue down with us \u2013 just the same path that we\u2019ve been going, we estimate it be closer to $260 million of lapses for this year. So again achieving, if we can conserve 10% of that $26 million, 20% is a little over $50 million. So, this is really a big deal. It was probably one of the bigger things we\u2019ve done in quite a number of years. If you look our total life in force premium last year in the last 12 months, I think we grew $58 million. So, if we are able to conserve $50 million of lapses, it will take our life premium growths to significantly higher level. And I will point out that the business we\u2019re conserving, because we\u2019ve already made the big upfront investment.", "We\u2019ll have a significantly higher margin than the new business we\u2019re writing. The $330 million that we wrote last year and we spent roughly $500 million to put that business on the books. To conserve this business if we are able to conserve $50 million, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll spend $5 million conserve that business. So, it will have although we haven\u2019t included any of that in our current guidance hopefully by next quarter we will have a little better be able to have a more confidence and what impact that we\u2019ll have for the balance of the year and reflected in our guidance for the balance of the year. But there would be in the margin on that conserved business, I mean how should we think about, is it almost all margin or is there. Well, no obviously you still have mortality costs and\u2026", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Yes, beyond that though, in terms of expenses, do we just need to think about the margin being kind of the gross margin tax affected?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Pretty much I mean let\u2019s take for example American income, we still would be paying renewal year commissions on that business. So there is still some commission expense, but its not that, we\u2019ve already got the high first year expense definitely indirect response we\u2019ve already spent the money upfront. So the cost of conserve that again I don\u2019t think it will be 10% of premium versus well over a 100% that we spend on our new business.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Very good, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks. I had a question, first, on just the agent count in American Income. It did rise a little bit this quarter. It went up in the first quarter of last year too but then it declined, so what your outlook is there? Secondly, on just what gives you confidence that Liberty National life sales will improve in the second half of the year, given that the agent count continues to decline and the actual results have been a little worse than what you\u2019ve expected the last few quarters? And then, finally, just on share buybacks. I think Gary mentioned that you\u2019ve got $643 million available through the rest of the year. If you don\u2019t do any deals and maybe you could discuss the deal environment also, but if you don\u2019t do anything there, then should we assume that most of that would be deployed towards buybacks some time over the next three quarters?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Okay. Well first half American income, I guess one of the big differences this year versus last year Jimmy as again and looking at the percentage of those new agents that are achieving that maximum bonus level for the first time. Even though our recruiting was up last year and we\u2019re reporting on more agents that numbers of that agents hitting that bonus level was declining and it did result and higher turnover so even though we saw some growth in the first quarter, we couldn\u2019t sustain and then it continue to decline throughout last year, which is where we are at today.", "Now with the renewed emphasis on spending more time with that agent better training and getting them to that bonus level, we are seeing a reversal of that trend. So again the last two months the number of new agents hitting that bonus level is up over 30% that\u2019s the main thing give me encouragement that we are back on the right track. We did hit a low of 37 I think 37, 24 at the end of January. They have 8% growth in last two months is very encouraging to me. Liberty national a little bit same way there is Liberty National was different that because of the way its incorporated and state of those business and it is been able to use temporary agents licenses, so we are a number if it well throughout its history. And almost become like a better word addicted to the temporary licenses.", "And the turnover at Liberty National has been so poor even compared to American income they only retain about half number of agents at American income does, I think a lot of that is the fact that a lot of these people never pass their exam, so they can write business for 90 days but then they are gone, and that\u2019s not productive. It\u2019s not productive use of management\u2019s time. So, I look into the first quarter, the number of agents who achieve, the new agents who got a permanent license who passed their exam, and now permanent is up 34% as well as the number of \u2013 it\u2019s not coincidence, the number of new agents hitting their maximum bonus level is up 34%.", "We\u2019re seeing a significant reduction as a result of changes in our incentive compensation and the number of temporary licenses has dropped almost in half the first quarter. So, I think we\u2019re making the right choices as far as getting long-term growth, but it \u2013 by not having all those agents with temporary licenses, where it is having some short-term impact on our sales but I\u2019m okay with that because we\u2019re trying to make changes that will generate longer-term growth.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then, the buybacks?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, as Gary mentioned, we do have a significant amount of cash. Right now, we\u2019re going ahead with the M&A activity. We have looked, Jimmy, and right now I don\u2019t see any really good prospects on the short-term horizon for an acquisition. So, we would expect to utilize most of that cash in the share repurchase although we do have a Board meeting tomorrow and that will be an item on the agenda.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yeah. I should be assuming that that\u2019s going to be front-ended more so if you \u2013 given the rates are pretty low, so would you front-end most of the buyback?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, again we\u2019ve got \u2013 we received middle of March the United Investors dividend.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yeah, yeah.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "We\u2019ve gotten a significant amount of cash sitting here. We \u2013 I would fully expect to accelerate our share repurchase in the second quarter from the first quarter level, but not really prepared this time to say exactly how much or when that will occur. Again that\u2019s one of the reasons, why we do have as wide of guidance spread as we have, but that is definitely on the agenda for the Board meeting tomorrow.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Good morning to you guys. Wondered if, Gary, you could refresh my memory. I thought you said, as soon as you had the money you\u2019d be doing sort of the maximum volume per day in buyback. It seems like your April volume would be less than the maximum. Was my math wrong or is it just tougher to buy the shares or was there something tactically?", "Gary L. Coleman", "Well actually (inaudible) remember saying we would know the maximum, but\u2026", "Mark S. McAndrew", "I was going to say. I\u2019m not sure that I heard him say that, but and obviously we haven\u2019t buying didn\u2019t buying anywhere near close (inaudible). Since we received that and Bob again that\u2019s about all we can say at this point is we will have a discussion at the meeting tomorrow. We could buy it back. I let Gary, we figure up the maximum would be somewhere in the $10 million or a day range.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Yeah, it\u2019s something.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "So we\u2019re nowhere near even at first quarter level. We were now were near buying the maximum.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Just trying to \u2013 in the last call I thought you said the environment, now that I misremembered the last, that I hate to try to remember the last call again, but I thought there was some comment that the environment for acquisitions had changed and you might consider something. Did I have that, Mark?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well yeah, I mean and we\u2019re still open to the thought of we\u2019ll look at most any thing reasonable. It just Bob we have been talking to a number of different investment bankers, we\u2019ve expressed our desire there, but even some of the potential candidates that we thought might be available. We basically have been told that they are really not. So definitely have changed a little bit in the last couple of months, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not opened toward, it\u2019s more, I just don\u2019t see anything out there presently that is really on the market.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Littleangen McAlenney", "It just seems like the two questions are sort of linked, maybe you were a little slow on the trigger on the buyback if you thought the deals environment was finally more favorable?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "And I think that\u2019s a fair assessment, Bob. Part of the reason we didn\u2019t, we could have spent more in the first quarter, but we really thought a couple of months ago that there were a couple of good potential acquisition prospects out there. But those candidates from what we know today are not anything that are going to happen in the short term. So yes our attitude is a little different than it was a couple of months ago.", "Gary L. Coleman", "Yeah, Bob. I think on the last call what we talked about the environment for an acquisition is good from the standpoint we\u2019ve got the cash, but also borrowing rates are so low that the right candidate came along, that it would be a good time to buy. But I agree with Mark. We've looked very hard and it\u2019s just looking more and more like there's not anything that's anywhere near imminent.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Littleangen McAlenney", "Okay, last question. Your health premium actually increased sequentially for the first time in a bunch of quarters, which is probably a function of persistency as much as sales. But I was surprised. Could we be at a stabilization point? Your earlier answer was you look for it to continue to decline a little bit but the rate of decline is seems to be slowing?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "Well, there is still some carryover Bob, our first quarter health premiums tend to be if you look historically tend to be stronger than the other three quarters. And lot of that still goes back to United American the Medicare Supplements business, we all seem to have strong first quarter sales and a lot of those people pay annually.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Gotcha.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "We do have, the first quarter tends to be stronger than the balance of the year. So I don't think a sequential increase is any sign. We expect to see the margins hold pretty well constant to the first quarter level, but still a small decline through the balance of the year.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Sarran with Macquarie.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "The lapsed reduction efforts that you talked about, given that first year collected premium on the life side fell, which I think it\u2019s the first time in a couple years at least, can you give us an update on what overall premium growth would look like over the next few years?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well Paul, we\u2019ve really don't provide guidance beyond the current year. And again without taking into account our conservation efforts which we have included in our guidance, I think we are just looking at somewhere in that 4% both in life premium range for this year. So I hopefully as the year progresses that will improve, as net sales results improve and results of some of our conservation improve, but again we haven\u2019t included the conservation efforts in our guidance at this point.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay. And then the conservation efforts, are those concentrated in any one business line or is that across all of the distributions?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "Well, we\u2019re taking a hard look at all of them, but right now from the analysis that we\u2019ve done thus far, I think the biggest potential is at American Income, followed by Liberty National, and a little less at Globe in the direct response, and they find it because of the type of business. American Income, almost all of their business, a very high proportion of there is automatic deduction from people\u2019s bank accounts each month. And there is more potential to conserve that versus Globe in the direct response. Most of that business is direct deal. We send people bill, they send it back in. So, from what we've seen, I think there\u2019s a lot more potential for American income than the other distributions but that\u2019s actually good because that is our highest margin business.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "", "Okay. And then just lastly, how are you looking now at the amount of capital you want to keep at the Holding Company? It was around $200 million but I think you've maybe backed away from that hard limit more recently.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, we haven\u2019t. Again, that will be a topic of discussion in our Board meeting tomorrow. At this point, we haven\u2019t changed that outlook, we \u2013 but that is something that we\u2019re going to continue to look at and will continue to discuss. And I think hopefully we\u2019ll get more comfortable of bringing that down.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Schuman with KBW.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you good morning. I guess I would like to start with just following up on that last one. So just to be clear I mean in order to have $643 million available to redeploy you would have to heed into what had been the $200 million question, is my interpretation correct here?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "For the balance of the year that would be correct. Yeah.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "That would be correct. Okay.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "If we hold the $200 million obviously the 443.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Right. Okay. So, clarified that. And then I guess like some others maybe I\u2019m struggling to, correct me if I think in the last call, but I was thinking last call you had some optimism about actually having slightly positive growth in health sales this year, but now it sounds like you\u2019ve described, you continued decline has been inline with your expectations. So am I not correctly remembering the comp sales in last quarter?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, we did. You are right. If I go back to quarter ago, we did expect a quarter ago to see small growth in our health sales this year. And that would be revision down. As far as the premiums we were not expecting. We were not expecting growth in overall premiums. We did say that we were expecting a small increase in our health sales, which we did not see in the first quarter. So in that regard, yes that is the change.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay and then once again just based on, just a reassessment of the Medicare manage situation basically?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Basically we hope to see more improvement on Medicare segment business and again American Income health sales and Liberty National health sales were all down a little more than what we had anticipated.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay and then on the Liberty National Life sales outlook, it is a pretty big change. I think against last quarter it was double-digit for the year, and I think based on your quarter by quarter comments of down first quarter, down second quarter, flat third quarter, and fourth quarter single digit, I mean is that nets to a decline for the year. You talked about the issues again this quarter you talked about last quarter but I'm just trying to understand. Is the key sort of delta? Is the key change from last quarter the issue around temporary licenses? Is that what changed the outlook over the last few months?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "Well that is part of it, I won\u2019t say that\u2019s all its out there their sales results are less and what we\u2019d anticipated in a quarter ago and again part of that was the shifting emphasis the permanently license agents and but in other their results in the first quarter were below our expectations.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, and then one last area, if I may. A little bit of help maybe with Part D arithmetic. I think the premiums this quarter or revenues were down sort of 5% to 6% kind of consistent with, I think, the 7% you had talked about before. Sales are off by a much bigger percent. But I guess some of that is group business. I mean, so I'm not sure how to map between maybe just the big decline in sales and what we're seeing in the premiums. Are you had it, does the large decline in sales imply that this at some point it\u2019s going to run-off pretty aggressively or is that not the right arithmetic?", "", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "No it really comes out to, a bulk of our sales come in the open enrollment period, which is in the fourth quarter and some of those carryover a little into the first quarter but both of our sales come in the fourth quarter. So we have a pretty good idea, while they have a real good idea by now what our revenues are going to be for this year. We see other than some people turning 65 we don\u2019t see the revenues are very predictable there during the balance of the year. So yes, our group sales were down in the fourth quarter last year and a little bit carryover in the first quarter of this year, which accounts for the decline and premium revenues that we\u2019re seeing, but that should be fairly consistent throughout the year.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. So we really just need to focus on that fourth quarter enrollment?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct. The sales that we see throughout the year, the other quarters are relatively insignificant.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey, thank you, good morning guys. A couple, if I may. One Mark, you are doing the prescription drug thing and I guess others are, too, on insert. Would there be a reason to suspect there might be a difference in terms of results between insert and direct when you go to direct?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have quite as much impact on the direct mail side of that business, mainly because the average what we\u2019re seeing is it has the older the age, the more impact it has, actually when you get about 50 years old, it has a much more significant impact in our mortality. And the average age that we\u2019re issuing in the insert side is \u2013 I think it\u2019s about seven years higher than it is on the direct mail side. So it will still have a \u2013 we expect it to have a significant an impact in our direct mail adult business, but not quite as much as it has on the insert media side.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, that\u2019s interesting. And then, if I may, going back to re-examine the question of temporary licensing and passing exams, Primerica has stated in the past that they\u2019ve had some issues with actually getting temporary licenses, I think particularly with regards to the state of Georgia. Is that what\u2019s affecting you there?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, not there have been a little issue with that, but that\u2019s being more a conscious decision on our part in order to improve our agent retention and try to get more long-term growth to really change our financial incentives for management. To not reward as heavily people who just started working with a temporary license and I know it's been an issue for the Primerica. On the other hand, American Income doesn't use temporary licenses at all and their recruiting efforts are obviously very successful.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And in the same vein, are you guys part and parcel of this effort to try to get the entry level exams maybe a bit easier, particularly given the type of products that you saw?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, it's interesting. I read the Wall Street article there earlier this week. And I didn't realize at the delay time that Primerica was really pushing through them, but it\u2019s definitely we would support, because again I look at our agency operations, the products that were selling are very simple. Whole life, term life products that I think in many states that the insurance exam is more difficult and it needs to be for the products that were selling, so I very much will support to them. And we look into what we need to do, what can we do to help support that.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then one more, if I may. On the regulatory side, issues over the last week with regards to claims payments, California and Florida. Are you guys involved at all? Have you been named?", "Larry M. Hutchison", "Mark, I'll address that. This is Larry. We haven't been named and I don't think will be named because Torchmark subsidiaries have a number of processes in place to address situations where an insured's died the formal claim has been filed. So we don\u2019t see it as an issue for the Torchmark companies.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "On the other thing I mentioned a different, I know there was number of companies when you sell whole life policy that generate cash value and when that policy stops paying the premium, you have to do something with that cash value and I know there are a number of large companies out there that use that cash value to buy a reduced paid up policy. For example you may have a $50,000 it generates ex-dollars of cash and what they will do with that if you stop paying the premium, they\u2019ll buy a $800 policy that\u2019s paid up for the rest of life.", "And those people, most of those people don\u2019t even realize that they have that coverage. So you end up building up as huge block of paid up business. On the contrary we don\u2019t use reduced paid up as a standard non non-forfeiture value in our products. For most part we use automatic premium loan or extended term insurance, so we don\u2019t have the same problem that some of these other company sales.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay, all right. Thank you guys very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks so much. Steve got most of my questions, I guess just one follow-up for the agent licensing can you guys commented at all in terms of what percentage of your agents that have temporary license ultimately turn to full time?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "That I wish, I had that Chris. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. It is obviously a number at Liberty. Again the only place that use it is at Liberty National. And I know that number is improving. If I look at the total numbers our agents at Liberty now who have who are operating on temporary license, its down to a 100 out of that 1844 which is almost a 50% reduction since the end of the year. So it\u2019s not something, it\u2019s something that is definitely improving and but it\u2019s not an issue American Income at all.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, and then if we, if the push was they are trying to get some of the licensing exams maybe a bit easier for people to pass would that adjust your strategy in terms of recruiting and incentivizing managers?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, that would be a huge plus for us if we\u2019re able to do that, because even though our passing rates are significantly better than Primerica\u2019s, but still they would be \u2013 if we can do our \u2013 and either I can\u2019t even quote you what our passing rates are, that\u2019s something I will definitely have by the next call. But if we can raise that by 25% obviously that will have significant positive impact in our distribution.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And any way to quantify in terms of what your best guess would be for what that could mean on a, maybe, point basis for sales?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well, Chris, I\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s something I look into, so that in the next call, it\u2019d just be pure speculation on my part at this point. But it is something I intend to look into and I\u2019ll have a little better \u2013 I\u2019ll be able to better answer that on the next call.", "Christopher Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll move next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Mark just two quick questions, two questions. First, regarding the math, the arithmetic of this conservation effort, is one way to think of it as follows, that you have about $1.8 billion in annualized life insurance in force and that a $50 million addition would add roughly 2 to 3 percentage points to that, what is currently running at a 3% year-over-year growth in the in force?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "I think that\u2019s a fair way to look at it, Eric. We\u2019re actually got to somewhere between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. If we can conserve $50 million, it would be close to a 3% additional improvement in our collected premiums. But again, it's something that if you project it out which we\u2019ve been doing, and that will compound overtime and it actually in subsequent years it would add more than 3% to our growth in premium.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Why is that? Why would it compound? Why would it be the rate of growth in premium?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "", "If I just look at our projections, if we continue to not only conserve. Okay, if we conserve $50 million on the first year and now $40 million of that will continue to be in force with the following year. Now if we can conserve another $50 million in year two. Now we haven\u2019t set a $50 million of growth. We have $90 million of growth. And of that $90 million, okay its 10% of that lapse after there is $81 million from prior years efforts plus another $50 million as well for them following year we have $130 million. And again I\u2019m just giving this as an example, but it does compound.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "So the idea is that you conserve in succeeding years what you conserved in preceding years. Is that\u2026?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Yes, I think it\u2019s our enforce growth actually the amount that we conserve will continue to grow along with it.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Second question is more of a qualitative one, just deepening my understanding of the underwriting process at Torchmark. Is the idea that heretofore you have not asked people what medications they're on, or you have asked them but they conveniently develop amnesia?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Well see that\u2019s the difference between our direct response our agency distribution. Our agency distribution we do much more underwriting. Even though we\u2019re looking at using the prescription drug record it won\u2019t have nearly the impact there and direct response the key is that is keeping the underwriting very simple. We ask really just something like five simple check the box yes, no questions.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And that\u2019s the basis that we use. So this is to be able to see that someone is taking a drug that indicates a serious health problem. Yeah that\u2019s a big step indirect response. So now we don\u2019t ask them currently to list whatever prescription they take, because again we\u2019re trying to keep that process very simple any time we\u2019ve tested a longer form an application and more extensive underwriting it\u2019s really hurt the response rate there.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And how does this work from a privacy point of view? Is the idea that when people apply, is this fairly straightforward in black and white that they agree? They give you authorization to consult with the pharmacy companies?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Yes they do, I mean on every application there was a stand there is an authorization one it allows us to check MIB\u2026", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "And it \u2013 but there is a very explicit authorization that allows us to review their prescription drug history. So yes and we founded that really hasn\u2019t at any significant impact negative impact on our response rates, it has increased the number. We\u2019re rejecting 4% to 5% of the business that we use to issue. So that it has some short-term or it is having some short-term impact on our reported sales because of that, but those are people that we had issued previously that are not risk that we want to accept.", "Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, Mark, I wanted to come back to John Nadel\u2019s question on the accounting change just to make sure I understood your response correctly. You talked about this $100 million of expenses that was an opportunity. Was that if you reduced those expenses? Was that if you restructured those expenses? And is that an annual earnings number that we could expect to potentially come back and be a boost of profits. Can you just dig into that little bit?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "And that\u2019s, if we just reclassify and that doesn\u2019t affect the profitability. That just affects the timing of the profitability. But, no you\u2019re right there is a $100 million or expenses there in distributions that don\u2019t appear to be deferrable beginning next year. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying is it does give us an opportunity and we are going back and taking a very hard look at each of those. And what can we do to reduce those and yes if we can reduce those expenses even by 5%, $5 million that will now go straight to the bottom line versus be deferred to over the life of that business.", "So yes it is something, at this point I\u2019m not really prepared to say what we think we can reduce those buy next year, but it is something that we are very focused on and taking a hard look at.", "Gary L. Coleman", "And Tom, that would be annually.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So that\u2019s an annual $100 million to think about adjusting some percent of that?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Right.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And now is there a chance and even I\u2019m not asking to say what the probability is, but is there some chance you could get all of those $100 million reclassified if you change the nature of the expense?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "I don\u2019t think we can get all $100 million. Again things like some of those expenses there are management or HR even on direct response. We have overhead there that is not ties to the sale of the policy. And that, those expenses are not going to be deferrable. So we don\u2019t have really option to reclassify those. There may will be a portion of 100 million that we can move into commission expense. I guess the biggest opportunity there is probably at Liberty National. But we\u2019re not able to really quantify what that might be at this point.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And so, there\u2019s really two things to focus on here. One is there might be some percent of that $100 million that could be reclassified, restructured in some way, which wouldn\u2019t be economic, wouldn\u2019t change your cash flow, but might improve GAAP profits. But then there is also the opportunity to reduce those costs, which would affect both.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Yes, that\u2019s true.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s clear. The other question I had is just on, just wanted to get an update on, are you still for your life insurance policy\u2019s crediting 6.5% plus, so your new money rate is about 6%. Where do you stand there? Any chance to reduce the cutting ratings to improve underwriting margins or rather investment margin?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "And again that is something we have discussed and we have decided for this year our new business to lower the new business interest rate crediting to 5.75, which we\u2019re going to grade up over five years to 6.75. And that has a little over $700,000 negative impact on our earnings this year, but that has been included in our guidance.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And it\u2019s going to grade up over five years to 6.75%?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "I think that\u2019s right.", "Gary L. Coleman", "That\u2019s just correct, yeah.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Now, just the last question I have is just a follow-up to that. What is it \u2013 why should you be selling a policy that starts at 5.75 that grades up given current rate environment? Shouldn\u2019t you be able to substantially reduce the crediting rate without a material impact or are there competitive implications if you went lower than the 5.75 grading uptake policy?", "Mark S. McAndrew", "It doesn\u2019t affect our policyholders, it doesn\u2019t change \u2013 we\u2019re not changing our pricing we are just changing an interest rate assumption. It doesn\u2019t, we don\u2019t have intra-sensitive policies, so we are not changing a crediting rate to cash values or some deposit fund. This is just changing our internal assumption on what interest rate we are going to credit reserves Garry you want to coming on that?", "Gary L. Coleman", "Yeah, I was just going to say it\u2019s really discount rate that we are using for the reserves. As Mark mentioned we haven\u2019t changed our pricing as result of that.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I\u2019m sorry okay that is okay I thought you are changing pricing no and that\u2019s was what embedded in the crediting rate within the pricing but this is simply a change in your accounting and, I should say your actuarial assumptions to set reserves.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s why it will have a negative impact of I think $740,000 is our estimate for this year.", "Gary L. Coleman", "But Tom we, the impact is slightly weak. I think we talked about on either last call on the one before that should we change the interest rate to match this new gap discount rate. We\u2019ll only be increasing our premiums about 1% to 3%. It wouldn\u2019t be a huge increase.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "And it\u2019s, if it\u2019s an election we make annually at the interest rate environment changes that we are not saying we might not change it back in subsequent years. But this year\u2019s business that we issued that is the interest rate we\u2019ve decided to go with.", "And if the interest rate environment continues to stay down we may again look at putting through some modest increases to maintain those margins.", "Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no other questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Mark McAndrew for any final remarks.", "Mark S. McAndrew", "Those are our comments for this morning and thank you for joining us and we will see you next quarter. Thanks again.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the second quarter was $129 million, or $14 per share; a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. Net operating income per share from continuing operations increased 14%. Net income was $149 million, or $1.32 per share, up 29% from a year ago. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.5% and our book value per share was $33.61; an 8% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 10% to $35.40 per share.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding United Investors, grew 4% to $434 million, and life underwriting margins increased 10% to $125 million. Life net sales declined 4% in the quarter to $85.5 million, while life insurance first year collected premiums were down to 2% to $62 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $151 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $51 million. Net life sales declined 2% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 4,332 up 3% from a year ago and up 7% from the last quarter.", "I am pleased with the continued progress being made in American income. The agent count is now at an all-time high and growing at a strong pace. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 27% during the quarter. Our mid-level sales management ranks also increased 11% during the second-quarter.", "In our Direct Response operation global life, life premiums were up 5% to $151 million and life underwriting margin was up 1% to $38 million. Net life sales were down 2% to $37 million. While second-quarter sales were somewhat let less than expected, I remain optimistic that we will see significant growth during the second half of 2011.", "While the previously discussed change in our direct response underwriting which utilizes its prescription drug data has improved on margin, it had a negative impact on our second-quarter sales as we rejected additional uninsurable applicants.", "We had made a significant improvement in the design of our Insert media packaging which resulted in a 16% improvement in our initial response rates during the second quarter. As a result of the improvements made in our packaging and the additional margins from the change in underwriting we have increased our third quarter Insert media distribution in excess of 20%. While there is a 60 day to 90 day lag before these increases reflected in our net sales, I am confident that we will see significant growth in our direct response life sales during the second half of this year life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% of $73 million. Life underwriting margins was up 29% to 418 million. Net life sales declined to 18% to $10 million. The producing agent counter at Liberty National at the end of the second quarter was 1792, decline of 3% during the quarter and down 20% from a year ago. On a bright note, health sales at the Liberty National increased 10% from a year ago and 40% from the first quarter level as a result of the introduction of new cancer policy.", "We\u2019ve made good progress during the quarter in our efforts to conserve or enforce life insurance. During the second quarter, out new incentives conserved $2.2 million life premium. We currently project that number to grow to $15 million to $16 million during the second half of this year and $40 million to $45 million in 2012.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding part D declined 7% to $185 million while health underwriting margin was down 11% to $34 million. Health net sales were $13 million for the quarter, 15% less than a year ago. Premium revenue for Medicare part D was $49 million, which is down 8% and the underwriting margin was $5.4 million, which was up 6%.", "Administrative expenses were $40 million, which were up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectation.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases.", "First, the investment portfolio. On our website, our three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds are $721 million, down from $863 million at December 2010. The $142 million decline this year is due primarily to dispositions, a $119 million of sales, $12 million of cost, and $10 million of maturities.", "The percentage of below-investment grade bonds to fixed maturities, at 6.7%, the lowest that it has been since the fourth quarter of 2008. That percentage may still be a little higher relative to our peers, however, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.", "During the quarter, we recognized \u2013 realized gains of $31 million pre-tax and $21 million after tax. These gains resulted primarily for dispositions above investment grade bonds that had been impaired in previous years. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $306 million compared to gains of $156 million at the end of the first quarter and $178 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the second quarter is due primarily to treasury yields declining more in credit as far as increased.", "Regarding the investment yield, in the second quarter we invested $432 million in investment-grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.75%, an average rating of A-minus at an average life of 28 years. For the six months, we\u2019ve invested $697 million at an average yield of 5.84%.", "For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.56%, compared to 6.62% yield in the previous quarter and a 6.74% in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to lower new money yields. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.55%.", "Now turning to excess investment income, excess investment income is net investment income less the interest cost and the net policy liabilities and the financing cost of our debt. In the second quarter, it was $74 million, down $492,000 from a year ago. However on a per share base, reflecting the impact to our share repurchase program, excess investment income was $0.65 per share, up 8% over the second quarter of 2010.", "As the components, net investment income was up $6 million or 4%, slightly lower than the 5% increase in the average invested assets. Despite the lower yields in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at around the same rate as the related assets because we had significantly more cash in short-term securities during the second quarter of 2010 than we have in 2011.", "The interest cost on net policy liabilities increased to $6 million or 8%, in line with a 7% increase in the average liabilities. Now turning to capital, regarding RBC, we planned to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%.", "This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings. Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first six months, we spent $602 million to buy 14 million Torchmark shares. So far in July, we\u2019ve used $15 million to buy another 350,000 shares.", "For the full year through today, we have used $617 million of parent company cash to acquire 14.3 million shares or 12% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of our assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results from the dividends received up to the parent from the subsidiaries, less the dividends paid to the Torchmark shareholders and the interest paid on the debt.", "The parent began the year with liquid assets of $205 million, and we expect to generate approximately $665 million of free cash flow for the entire year. Thus, the total free cash available for all the 2011 will be around $870 million. Now in the first six months, we generated about $485 million of free cash flow, and that included $305 million resulting from the sale of United Investors. As mentioned, the parent used $602 million in the first six months for Torchmark share repurchases.", "As a result, , the parent ended quarter with $87 million of available liquid assets and that\u2019s comprised with the $205 million of beginning assets, plus $485 million are free cash flow, less $602 million of share repurchases.", "Going forward along with $87 million of cash on hand at the second quarter, we should generate approximately $4,180 million of free cash flow in the next two quarters. As of today, after deducting the $15 million of July share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $252 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are available, we expected share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.", "Those are my comments, I will turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. We are narrowing the range of our earnings guidance for 2011 and raising the low end of that range. We currently expect our net operating income per share will range from $4.60 to $4.73. Those are my comments for this morning.", "I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question at this time Jimmy Bhullar, JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thank you. I head question on just the base of buybacks, you mentioned you have bought back $617 million worth of stock so far this year. And should we assume that the $252 million that\u2019s available for buybacks through year end most of that will be used up through for buybacks or are you going to keep some of the $87 million and push or are you going to keep some of that. And the second question I had was just on Liberty National, the agent count declined again in the second quarter. Sales were weak, I think they were down around 18% so what is your outlook is for growth in the agent count and the sales in the second half of the year at Liberty National. Thanks.", "Gary Coleman", "Okay, the first half Jimmy on share repurchase as Gary said I think we have $252 million available at the parent for the balance of the year. It\u2019s something that \u2013 we have \u2013 again we have a board meeting next week that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate we took that free cash down to $87 million at the end of the last quarter. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that we\u2019ll probably keep it somewhere around that level for balance of the year, but again we will continue to evaluate each quarter.", "As far as Liberty National, the agent count decline slowed, but it was still down 3% during the quarter. I can\u2019t \u2013 I am not expecting any big turnaround. I think we have \u2013 we are about at the bottom there, but I am not expecting for the balance of this any big turnaround. We are seeing some growth on the health side, as a result of new product we have introduced, but I would expect our life sales that Liberty National for the balance of the year to stay at about the same level there.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, fine.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jeffrey (inaudible) KBW.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. You talked about the kind of the trajectory for the conservative (inaudible) $15 million to $16 million in the back half, $40 million to $45 million next year. I\u2019m sure you said this today, but I think what I follow is was that companywide or is that mostly specific to American income or what we talk about.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that\u2019s companywide. We do, we have the most impact at American income and again I think we put, we have a new exhibit out on the website now showing lapses by distribution. We think we can conserve 20% of the lapses.", "In 2012, at American income ranging down to I think roughly 13% of liberty national and roughly 15% in the direct response. So, the bigger portion in the second quarter, we first started with American income because that is obviously our most profitable business. But if those numbers that I gave are across the board and we will have an impact in all three of the major distribution systems, but it will be a little higher at American Income.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the prescription drug underwriting impact, can you remind us kind of what the trajectory is there? Is that something where a better mortality will bleed in over many years or it something that maybe a year from now it actually will be really visible to us, what do we expect there?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, it will take. It will bleed in basically over a number of years. I look it will have more impact and that allow us to grow our sales, but on insert media side, which is about 60% of our sales, it improves our margin by, I believe, it\u2019s 16% to 18%. Now, that\u2019s a significant block of business, but that\u2019s just our new business going forward.", "So, we\u2019ll have some impact and it\u2019ll be a growing impact on our financials. It gives us more margin to work with as far as increasing our sales, as I mentioned earlier and partially as the result of that, we are increasing our volume \u2013 our distribution volume by, I think, 22% in the third quarter and right now we anticipate increasing our volume by 24% in the fourth quarter. So, you\u2019ll see more of the impact on the sales side.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks a lot, Mark.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll hear from Randy Binner, FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, thanks. I have a question about \u2013 there is a callable prefers out there, I believe, that have a pretty high coupon, I think, it\u2019s 710 basis points and, so I think that there is $120 million worth in the callable and there were callable in June, and so I didn\u2019t see anything in the results that indicated that those have been called, to me it seems like, kind of, a no brainer to try and do it, just because you have such much cheaper sources of funding, but I didn\u2019t know if that was still on the table, if there is color around that if that a big buyback in the quarter maybe had anything to do with that, I\u2019d love to hear color on that potential opportunity?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay, Randy, that\u2019s something we take a look at, they because callable as of June 1st and they are callable as they are they are due past and they are callable in whole or part and at par, and they\u2019ll continue to be call but one (inaudible).", "We did take a look at that in terms of how to redeem it if we felt the use of cash \u2013 if we\u2019re going to use cash, we felt that using the cash or share repurchases provided a greater return. We also looked at, though if we refinance and if we issue the similar security \u2013 the summer trust referred that the key point, we\u2019d actually be able to higher than 70 and we\u2019ve today. Because, remember, this is a very long-term, as you know the 35 years around on the security, so it\u2019s \u2013 for long-term security \u2013 it\u2019s not that better rate.", "(inaudible) we looked at those, if we refinanced or reissuing debt, we looked at \u2013 for example, (inaudible) two-year debt, we can do that at a lower rate, and we\u2019d pick up $0.01 to $0.03 maybe earnings per share. That concern there is the refinancing risk, five to 10 years, what interest rates will be and may be much higher.", "So, our current thinking is that we\u2019ll, kind of, stay where we are and not redeem them, but that\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to look at as conditions change.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "I guess, I mean, if the \u2013 does the buyback clearly has slowed from the pace of the first half, I mean, there is less cash available for buyback, there is (inaudible), meaning that the earnings yield on your buyback is better than 710 basis points right now according to most analysts forward numbers. So, that I guess there, but if you had less cash available for buyback, would that effect the decision or is it a longer term decision there?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think it will be a longer-term decision in that, but the fact that would matter though, you know how consistent our cash flow is \u2013 the free-cash flow. We\u2019ll continue to do generate free cash and what we might do is we must start redeeming or calling them in parts as supposed to calling the whole 120 million at one time.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs is next.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. I just want to see if you guys can update us on sort of the liquidity buffer that you guys had been keeping at the parent company. I believe it was roughly $200 million or so. It\u2019s sort of certainly below that today, as we get kind of through here and maybe some of the economic uncertainty increases, how are you thinking about moving forward with that question?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well Chris, that\u2019s why we are not giving a lot of guidance there because as Garry mentioned we have $252 million available at the parent for the balance of this years. Obviously the pace of our share repurchase so far in July, we have slowed down and it\u2019s something we will continue to evaluate. Sure, there is some definite uncertainties out there today, and even in our guidance, I think we put in a range of 70 \u2013 I think $78 million, Gary, that $228 million as far as the range.", "Gary Coleman", "It\u2019s right.", "Mark McAndrew", "Of share repurchase in our guidance. It didn\u2019t make a lot of difference, it only made a couple of cents difference in our earnings for the balance of the year. But it\u2019s something I\u2019m not really prepared to say how much we will spend the balance of the year. We will continue to evaluate as we go.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then within the aging count trends, obviously American income you guys are having some success there. Can you comment a little bit on sort of some of the drivers there and are there any takeaways that you can try and pull out to try and improve sort of the downward trend we have been seeing at Liberty National?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well first of I will talk about American Income, I am very pleased with where we are at. I know sales were still down 2%, but if you look \u2013 if you look at the numbers, we were down 4% going into the quarter and rising accounts and were up 3% at the end of the quarter.", "We grew by almost 300 agents during the quarter. If we can continue close to that pace, if we can continue and grow 250 agents a quarter the next two, by year end our agent count be up 25% from a year ago and sales will follow that trend. There is not a lot new going on, there is more just a refocus. As I mentioned, we have grown our middle management ranks in a very concerted effort to promote more people into middle management.", "We grew that by 11% during the quarter. The other problem we had last year even though recruiting was up, we \u2013 because we did not have more middle managers and because we lost focus on the training of those new agents, our turnover went up and that\u2019s why that number as far as new bonus earners hitting the top level bonus, those are the people we retain and for that number to be up 27% from a year ago, it is being reflected in higher agent retention.", "So all of the things that we\u2019ve talked about last really six to nine months are coming \u2013 are panning out. We are refocused, we are hiring more agents, but we are also retaining more agents. So I feel very good about where American Income is and their sales will come back very strongly in the second half.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. And just one last one, any updates sort of on EITFO9-G in terms of impact or implementation for you guys?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, no update on that. The current status of that is that, first of all we would like to talk directly, which I think most companies well.", "So we\u2019re in a process of doing our calculations of what the initial write-down will be the DAC asset, but there is still a lot of implementation issues that haven\u2019t been fully resolved and I know the big four firms are still consulting with the SEC and how to interpret certain provisions and of course as we work through that that effects and we\u2019re doing so. I think all this should be cleared up in the third quarter and by the time we\u2019ll get to the analyst calls for the third quarter. We will have defensive numbers at that point.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank for the time.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll hear from Colin Devine with Citi.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Good morning, good afternoon I guess now. Couple of questions, first, I guess, with the buybacks you\u2019ve done \u2013 I appreciate you\u2019re still fair amount of debt capacity, but does that mean that M&As is really not something that\u2019s likely depend of this year and I suppose that also going to bring it up your current thinking on actually with first command.", "Then Mark, with respect to Liberty, I appreciate your \u2013 it sounds like getting fairly frustrated with it. What is not working there that clearly works so well for your American income?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. First on the M&A activity. Colin, we have looked extensively and really don\u2019t see anything out there when we made the decisions obviously buyback that much in the quarter. It was because we didn\u2019t see any M&A activity on the short-term horizon.", "So, your conclusion there is accurate. Liberty National, as I have mentioned before, it really is there are so many differences between Liberty and American Income. And again, I\u2019ve equated it in the past to franchise versus a company-owned store and American Income, it\u2019s a straight commission situation whereas the Liberty National, the agents and managers are employees, those are our offices.", "We have a lot of fixed expenses and the production pervasion is sustainably less. It was about half of what it is at American Income. It\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been, really over the last two or three years, trying to move Liberty more to an American Income and we will continue to do so, but it\u2019s just not a quick fix there. The things that work at American Income, we have tried to implement similar-type programs at Liberty National, but they \u2013 up to this point, they have not been successful.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Let\u2019s get first command, you got any comment on that and then just \u2013 and also Liberty, with the new, sort of debt treatment, because that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve seen me, sort of, put that business model even under more pressure than it\u2019s at right now?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that\u2019s correct. First off \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, first amendment, it\u2019s independent agencies that we continue to \u2013 their sales have been down now for number of years. It\u2019s a very persistent business and very consistently profitable business.", "And we\u2019ll continue to \u2013 there are no plans to do anything at this point, but it is an independent agency that we really don\u2019t control. But, it\u2019s \u2013 another one I was saying is we don\u2019t believe that we get fair value out of it. We don\u2019t control the distribution, but it\u2019s become a relatively small piece of our total, so really no plans to do anything there.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And then with the (inaudible) change, I mean does that really put even more pressure on you right now with Liberty?", "Mark McAndrew", "It does and again that\u2019s something that we have been addressing and we\u2019ll continue to address. The number of offices that we have at Liberty has \u2013 I think we are somewhere in the mid-90s now where I believe a year ago we were at 150. So we have been very much addressing some of that where we have in reducing our expenses there. And we are continuing to look for ways to lessen the impact of the debt change.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And next we hear from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Hi, good afternoon everybody. A couple of questions for you, one is just to go back to the guidance and the buybacks and just \u2013 I just want to understand your revised guidance, it appears I think as you mentioned Mark in response to somebody\u2019s question, it seems you revised guidance includes a higher level of buybacks than you were originally assuming six or nine months ago when you originally gave us that guidance. Is that the case?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, there is no doubt at beginning of the year even though we knew what the available cash would be, the reason we had such a wide range was not just how much we would spend on share repurchase but at what price?", "So obviously earlier in the year pre-split, the stock was up around $68, so when we ran our projections out, we ran not only different amounts being spent, but different prices. So we were able \u2013 we did spend towards the high-end of our guidance as far as the amount of money, we spend, but we also got at a lower price than what our guidance was. So, now that the bulk of that share repurchase has been completed and we know the price and the amount, it definitely took the bottom end of their range out of the picture.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Understood. I guess, I was sort of \u2013 I was wondering if upper end of their range, would if otherwise being higher, if not for \u2013 something else going on the business relative to your original guidance, I\u2019m not sure.", "Gary Coleman", "I think everything else is going pretty according to the plan as far as, even last quarter even though we were under the Street estimate, we\u2019re right where our projections and the same this quarter. Other than share repurchase, our earnings are about where we thought they would be at the beginning of the year.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "And then, okay. So separately just a question on the life underwriting margin and my model definitely doesn\u2019t go back nearly as far as your business does, but as far as I can see, your underwriting margin on the life insurance business this quarter was as high as I have ever seen it. Is that sustainable? Is there is something that \u2013 when it just really well this quarter that \u2013 we are going to think about that more like we have seen it over the past few years?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, it was better this quarter, but particular at Liberty, it was I think up 29%, but that was more a result of, a year ago, it was particularly bad quarter.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "I guess, I\u2019m just looking at underwriting income divided by premiums?", "Mark McAndrew", "It was a little above the average, but Gary, you have any comments on that.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, it was for example, 29%. I think it\u2019s just about higher than where we were last quarter and the big part of that was Liberty. We\u2019ve had two as I said this quarter was unusually low in terms of life claims whereas and if you look at last year\u2019s comparison of \u2013 the second quarter last year was particularly high claim quarter.", "We\u2019re seeing some fluctuation in those life claims, we anticipate that we get back to more of a norm and so I would think that we\u2019re now looking for that level to continue at Liberty and as a result. If it goes back to more than norm then we\u2019ll get back to around the 28% level that we reported last couple of quarters.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. So..", "Gary Coleman", "28 year-to-date. I think that\u2019s sustainable, we were one point over that in the second quarter.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay, that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m just going to ask you, if more the year-to-date was a better indication. Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And next we will hear from Mark Hughes with Sun Trust.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 Sun Trust", "Yeah, thank you. The use for the prescription drug data for underwriting, how much to that dampen sales in the quarter, can you say?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, again in the \u2013 it had more of an impact on the insert media, which is 60% of our sales we\u2019re declining above on additional 5%, but I will give you a little more clave on what\u2019s going on in direct response.", "Again, the insert media side, which is 60% of our direct response sales. We increased as a result of the potential gain on the underwriting margin. In the first quarter, we increased our circulation by 12%, but we saw a 13% decline in our response rate, so it, kind of, washed. We actually did not see an increment of volume of new inquiries coming in, people saying that they are interested in buying life insurance. However, as I mentioned, we through some testing that we did, we found a package that performed much better, so in the second quarter, our circulation there, we increased at 9%, but we had a 17% improvement in our response rates as a result of packaging.", "So, we actually saw a 27% improvement increase in the number of people responding to us in that marketplace. So, going forward, again we\u2019re now back to where we were increasing the outbound circulation there, 22% and 24% in the next two quarters. So, we feel very good about where we are at going forward, but the first quarter was \u2013 our response rates were disappointing there, but that has definitely turned around in the second quarter and we expect to see good growth in the balance of this year and next year. The problem is that there is a lag between the initial response and the time we report sales.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 Sun Trust", "Right. Now the good package or better package you said on the second quarter, is that more broadly distributed in Q3 or are these new packages that you\u2019re going to be distributing in the back half?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, now it actually \u2013 it\u2019s something we had tested previously that we rolled out within the second quarter. Again, that\u2019s why we went from a 13% decline in our response rates to 16%, 17% improvement in the second quarter as a result of rolling out with that new package. We expect continued, we continue to expect to see that improvement in response rates, second half of the year.", "But again you need to understand that \u2013 those are people that send in our cards saying, yes, I\u2019m interested in buying life insurance. We then over the next six months or sending them numerous product packages and they in turn send an application back in. But even after the application is received because there is a dollar introductory offer, we don\u2019t treat it as a sale until they pay the first fully initial premium.", "So that\u2019s why I say there is a 60 day to 90 days lag from the time we get that initial inquiry and before we start reporting the sales, that\u2019s why again the second quarter sales numbers did not grow even though the number of new inquiries coming in grew at a very nice clip about \u2013 that will be reflected in higher sales for several quarters down the road.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 Sun Trust", "(Inaudible) the visibility for Q3 and Q4?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 Sun Trust", "How when you look at this kind of economic environment where there is \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can characterize it but does it make a difference \u2013 much of the difference on your business when you\u2019ve got \u2013 I don\u2019t know economic slowdown, let\u2019s say more uncertainty in the economy should that have much impact?", "Gary Coleman", "Well it hasn\u2019t and direct response it has and again that\u2019s our constant challenge as I mentioned again in the first quarter our response rates were down 13% from a year ago. Basically using the same package that we were using a year ago and borrowing us continuing to find ways to be better our sales would be down fairly significantly in direct response. But again we continue to look for ways to (inaudible) as a result. Even in the difficult economy, we fully expect to grow.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 Sun Trust", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Currently, we have no questions in the queue, but I\u2019d like to take the opportunity remind our audience (Operator Instructions). We will pause for just one moment. And we have no questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019ll turn the conference over to our host for any closing or additional remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us, I guess this afternoon now, and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And for those of you on the East Coast, good afternoon. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the third quarter was $129 million, or $1.22 per share; and a per share increase of 13% from a year ago. Net income was $137 million or $1.30 per share, a 38% increase on a per share basis. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.3% for the quarter, and our book value per share was $35.20, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 16% to $40.92 per share.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue, excluding United Investors, grew 3% to $430 million, and Life underwriting margins increased 5% to $121 million. Life net sales declined 1% in the quarter to $78 million.", "At American Income, Life Premiums were up 9% to $154 million, while Life underwriting margins were up 8% to $51 million. Life net sales increased 8% for the quarter to $36 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 4,448, which was up 9% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter.", "I believe that American Income is back on track. New agent recruiting was up 11% from a year ago. The number of new agents who achieved our top bonus level for the first time increased 40% from a year ago. And our mid-level sales management ranks have grown 23% from a year ago. American Income, I believe, is now in position to see renewed double-digit growth in sales during the fourth quarter and throughout 2012.", "In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, Life premiums were up 3% to $145 million and Life underwriting margin was also up 3% to $37 million. Net Life sales were down 4% to $31 million. As a result of the changes in our underwriting which we previously discussed and improvements in our package design, we increased our insert media circulation by 22% in the third quarter. The responses received from these inserts increased 43% during the quarter.", "There is a significant lag from the time those responses are received until a net sale is recognized. However, we are confident that the increased responses will result in net sales growth in the fourth quarter as well as subsequent quarters. For the fourth quarter, we intend to increase our insert media circulation by 38% over last year. However, due to the uncertainty in the economy, our guidance projects only mid single-digit growth in Direct Response sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2012.", "Life Premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million and Life underwriting margin was up 5% to $16 million. Net Life sales declined 23% to $9 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at the end of the third quarter was 1,578, which was down 27% from a year ago. Health sales at Liberty National jumped 47% as a result of some new product offerings in our worksite payroll deduction market.", "Effective January 1 of 2012, all sales office and lead expenses at Liberty National will become the responsibility of our branch managers as we continue to move Liberty National to a model similar to American Income. Also as of November 1 of this year, all new agents will be hired on an independent contractor basis versus employee, again following the American Income model. While these changes may have some short-term effect on our sales, we believe they are necessary to preserve our profit margins and to put Liberty National in a position to achieve long-term growth.", "We continue to make excellent progress in our efforts to reduce our lapses in our Life Insurance businesses. As I mentioned on the last call during the second quarter, we were able to conserve $2.2 million of annualized premium through our new conservation initiatives. For the third quarter, we were able to conserve $5.8 million of annualized premium. These numbers will continue to grow as we expand our conservation efforts. For 2012, our guidance assumes $30 million to $35 million of annualized premium will be conserved next year.", "On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding part D, declined 6% to $177 million while Health underwriting margin was down 8% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 26% to $16 million. In addition to the previously mentioned growth at Liberty National, the United American Independent Agency sales grew 46% to $7.6 million for the quarter, reflecting improvement in the Medicare supplement marketplace in both individual and group. For 2012, we currently project 10% to 15% growth in our net Health sales.", "Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 5% to $50 million while underwriting margin improved 18% to $7 million. For 2012, we have developed a new lower cost part D plan which will allow us to pick up 76,000 low income subsidized auto enrollees as well as grow our individual sales. This new product is priced with the same underwriting margin as our existing products. We do expect, however, for part D revenues to increase by 40% to 50% next year.", "Administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. They were roughly $800,000 over our projection, primarily as a result of additional salary expenses associated with our conservation efforts. For 2012, we anticipate a 1% to 2% increase in administrative expenses.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases.", "First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.2 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $10 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below-investment grade bonds were $734 million, down from the $863 million at December 2010. The $129 million decline this year is due primarily to $142 million of dispositions, offset partially by $12 million of downgrades.", "The percentage of below-investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.8% compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. That percentage may still be a little high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 20%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-minus compared to BBB-plus a year ago.", "We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $942 million compared to gains of $306 million at the end of the second quarter and $572 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to treasury yields declining more than the credit spreads increased.", "Now regarding our investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $134 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.53%, an average rating of BBB-plus and an average Life of 29 years. For the nine months, we\u2019ve invested $831 million at an average yield of 5.79% and an average rating of A-minus.", "For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.54% compared to 6.56% in the previous quarter and 6.68% in the third quarter of 2010. The continual decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.53%.", "Regarding RBC, we\u2019ve planned to maintain our capital level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient, for our companies in light of the consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and the level of our ratings.", "Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the first nine months, we\u2019ve spent $720 million to buy 17 million Torchmark shares. So far in October, we\u2019ve used $14 million to buy another 400,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have used $734 million of parent company cash to acquire 17.6 million shares or 15% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.", "At September 30, the parent company had $166 million on hand and should generate approximately $6 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. As of today, after deducting the $14 million of October share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $158 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. And if market conditions are favorable, we\u2019d expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.", "Now before I turn the call back to Mark, we would like to discuss the impact of two issues, the new accounting rules for DAC and the current interest rate environment. Regarding DAC, on January 1, 2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding deferred acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will not be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard had been in place in prior periods.", "Going forward, the earnings impact will the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write down will be between 15% to 25% of the current DAC asset, which will result in a 9% to 15% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding OCI. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.10 per share lower than they would have been under the old accounting rules. And we also project that our ROE will rise from the current 14% level to somewhere between 15% and 17%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012. We will give more definitive guidance in the fourth quarter analyst call.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rates involves the impact on earnings but not the balance sheet. In response to lower interest rates, we plan to raise the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income\u2019s Life products, and the Direct Response (inaudible) products by 5%.", "These increases will provide additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact of sales. However, in an extended low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline as we invest new money at lower rates and thus, will pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slower than might be expected since on average, only 2% to 3% of the fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years.", "To help quantify the impact of extended lower rates on excess investment income, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money yield of 4.75% for the next five years along with a GAAP reserve discount rate of 4.75% graded to 6.5% on policies issued during that time period. Under that scenario, our portfolio yield would drop to somewhere between 5.95% and 6.10% after five years, and the average GAAP discount rate for the entire in-force block would be around 5.6%. As such, we would earn a spread of 35 to 50 basis points over the net policy liabilities while earning the full 595 to 610 basis points on our equity. As you can see, we would still generate substantial excess investment income along with our high underwriting margins.", "Now, let\u2019s switch to the balance sheet. Due to the nature of the products we sell in our higher underwriting margins, our DAC and benefit reserve balances will not be significantly impacted by an extended low interest rate environment. Unlike many of our peers, most of our in-force business consists of straightforward protection line policies that are not interest sensitive and they were accounted for in accordance to FAS 60. Under FAS 60, we will not increase amortization of DAC or put up additional benefit reserves due to interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition situation occurs.", "We have conducted loss recognition testing using our September 30 financial data. In order to have a loss recognition situation in all the Life business, we would have to believe that our overall portfolio yield would drop to 4% and remain there permanently. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a reasonable set of circumstance that this scenario would occur. As such, we\u2019re not concerned about the low interest rate environment affecting our balance sheet through adjustments to DAC reserves or goodwill.", "The only block of business where extended low interest rates might affect the balance sheet is our fixed annuities, which were accounted for under FAS 97. However, due to the size of our annuity block, any impact would be insignificant.", "With regards to statutory financials, we performed the New York 7 cash flow testing scenarios at each year in accordance with the regulatory requirements. We updated this testing at the end of the third quarter to incorporate the lower treasury rates and determine that we still generate adequate surplus in each of those seven scenarios. Therefore, no additional statutory benefit reserves are required. Finally, a low interest environment can affect towards more RBC related to the fixed annuities. However, any impact there would not be significant.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. For 2011, we project our net operating income per share will be within the range of $4.65 to $4.69 per share. For next year, we are projecting our net operating income per share to be between $5.10 and $5.40 per share. I would like to reiterate that this guidance reflects the $0.06 to $0.10 reduction as a result of the changed NDAC accounting.", "Those are my comments for this morning. We will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from the side of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks. I had a couple of questions. First one for Mark, if you could talk about your sales expectations at Liberty National. In the past when you\u2019ve tried to make changes over adjust commission; there\u2019s been generally more disruption than initially expected. So, I realized Liberty is smaller than it used to be, but it\u2019s still about 10% of your Life sales. So I was wondering if the momentum at American Income and Direct Response next year would be offset by this weakness that Liberty National overall.", "And then secondly for Gary, you mentioned $158 million of cash at the parent company. How much do you think you\u2019ll need to maintain in this type of an environment as a cushion and assuming that whatever that cushion is, anything above that would be used for buyback?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, well first at Liberty National. You\u2019re correct, Jimmy, that any major changes in the past, we have seen a disruption. And our guidance, we\u2019re still assuming a mid single-digit decline in our Life sales at Liberty National next year, although we do expect to see some growth in our Health sales at Liberty National next year.", "On the other hand, we have announced these changes a couple of weeks ago. And they were well received. I will point out, a year-ago we had 165 offices at Liberty National. And today, we\u2019re down to 75. We have closed or consolidated most of the underperforming offices there and I felt like these changes were very well received. I really believe that the branch managers that we have now have the desire to grow, the ability to grow, as well as the tools to grow. So I remain optimistic that we will see a turnaround at Liberty National next year although again, in our guidance, we have assumed a small continued decline in our Life sales.", "Gary Coleman", "And Jimmy, as far as the cash cushion is concerned, I would think we would have a cushion somewhere between $50 million to $100 million. There\u2019s not any specific need that we\u2019re targeting but we feel like we do need to cushion it. It should somewhere be in that range.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just one more on med stuff. You mentioned you\u2019re \u2013 part D you mentioned enrollment expectation. But what\u2019s going on in terms of pricing in the med stuff market? We\u2019ve heard of some of the major medical companies trying to expand further in that business. Can you talk about just pricing trends in the Medicare market?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, overall, our pricing trends have been very favorable. Again, we re-priced our products, I think, last year and the largest selling product \u2013 the high deductible plan F, I know, we have actually reduced our rate the last two years, which has made it more attractive. Really over the last several years, we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen very small single-digit increases on all of our products. I\u2019m not seeing \u2013 even though we\u2019re seeing some activity there, it\u2019s still a very small part of our business. And while we expect some growth there, we don\u2019t expect it to get \u2013 we\u2019re not projecting it\u2019s going to get back to where it was 10 years ago. So it will continue to be a competitive marketplace. But again, we think in a competitive situation, we\u2019re in better shape than we\u2019ve been in a number of years.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the side of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey. Good morning, everybody. Mark, first on the part D, I got \u2013 maybe this is terminology. You\u2019ve lowered the costs. You\u2019re going to pick up 76,000 auto enrollees, that\u2019s going to lead to 40% to 50% increase in revenues. But you said the same margin. Now, do you mean by that the same profit margin like around 10% or whatever? Or are you talking about the ultimate earnings?", "Mark McAndrew", "It has the same margin as the percentage of premium.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. So...", "Mark McAndrew", "As our other products. We basically came up with a product that has a little higher deductible and also a more narrow formulary as far as what prescriptions are covered which allowed us to bring \u2013 we still have the same products that we offered last year. But we added another product which has a lower cost which got us below that medium pricing level, which qualified us, I think, in 21 out of 34 regions for the low income subsidized people.", "So in addition to the 76,000 that we\u2019re picking up immediately, we\u2019ll start picking up about 2,000 additional people each month, people turning 65 as a result of that also. So yes, we feel very comfortable that we will see that kind of growth in our part D revenues next year.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then if I may continue, on Globe, the discussion with regards to responses, those numbers sound huge yet the sales guidance I guess for conservative reasons isn\u2019t there. I mean, what could go wrong between the responses and the sales?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well...", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Go wrong is probably the wrong word.", "Mark McAndrew", "No. It\u2019s an okay terminology. Again, you have to understand in the insert media, the whole process. And it\u2019s a long process. We first put a very simple insert piece into some of the media, whether it\u2019s a coupon pack or a newspaper or a DirecTV bill. That is what we increased, that volume by 22% in the third quarter. People then send us a response either most of those responses are reply cards that are mailed in, although they can also call in, or get on the Internet. But most of those people send back a reply card. Once we get the reply card in and the number of responses we got we\u2019re up over 50%.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "So they were big numbers.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yeah, substantially. Once we get that reply in, we start sending a series of product offerings, really not just the next 3 months but 6 months, 12 months even out further than that. For example, historically, the first product offering we send out, we get 8% to 9% of those people to buy. The second one, it goes down in the 3% to 4% range. The third one, it goes down in the 2.5% to 3% range. But we continue to get people to reply to those product mailings, which include an application and rates for an extended period of time. But even after these people send the application in, it has $1 for the first month introductory offer. So after we issue the policy, we then have to, 30 days later, we send them a bill. And until they pay that renewal premium, we don\u2019t treat it as a sale.", "So, in fact, I apologize. I should have better lag numbers for exactly how long after that insert media increases will we see those sales. And I will have better numbers for the next call. But again, the first step of that, the number of responses is up according to our plan. It just takes an extended period of time for that to be turned into what we report as net sale.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. I appreciate all that. Let me just ask one little follow up to that. Is there anything about \u2013 I know the new underwriting that you\u2019re doing that could lead to the ultimate hit rate, how long it takes to be lower than it has been historically?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re issuing a smaller percentage of the applications we\u2019re getting in. So, that does offset somewhat.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "That we decline, I think its 5% to 6% more of the business that we\u2019re getting in. So that does somewhat offset the growth in sales. If we weren\u2019t doing that, our sales would be 5%, 6% higher although the profitability of those sales would be lower. So that is one of the factors that temper the growth in sales.", "But also, again, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, the insert medias, the one aspect of our business that the response rates do tend to follow the consumer confidence index. And so again, we tempered a little bit because even though the inquiries are up, we could still see \u2013 if you say what could go wrong, we could still see those response rates for the fulfillment packages could go down or the percentage of the people who end up paying beyond the dollar introductory offer could go down as a result of economic conditions. So we\u2019re trying to be on the conservative side there.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the side of Edward Spehar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Good morning, I guess. Mark, could you go over one more time the conservation numbers for \u2013 what they were in the second and third quarter and then what your expectation is for \u201812?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, sure. In the second quarter, our new conservation efforts, in addition to what our agents are doing, we conserve about $2.2 million of annualized premium. In the third quarter, that number increased to $5.8 million. And I would point out, over 60% of that business is being conserved is that American Income, which again is our \u2013 it\u2019s where we focus our initial efforts because it\u2019s our highest margin business obviously. But in our guidance for next year, we have assumed somewhere between $30 million to $35 million of conserved annualized premium. Our goal is still to beat that number but that is what we\u2019ve used in our guidance.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And when we think about the earnings impact of a dollar of conserved premium given the fact that it\u2019s more than 60% American Income. How should we think about what the dollar amount to the bottom line is of that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, it\u2019s one of those things, for example, the \u2013 it takes time. The $5.8 million that we conserved this quarter had almost no impact this quarter because those people \u2013 a vast majority of those of people are paying monthly. So it had almost unnoticeable impact this quarter. But as we continue to conserve business, that number will grow. In our guidance, the conservation added about $0.03 a share after tax next year.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So it\u2019s not a big number?", "Mark McAndrew", "Not at this point. It\u2019s something that will continue to grow over time as we continue to do this. And each quarter, it will continue to add more value.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I meant the part D, so you\u2019re saying that the expectation is that the top and bottom line should be up 40% to 50% next year versus this year?", "Mark McAndrew", "It should be very \u2013 yes, that would be a reasonable expectation. Yes.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then when we think about, I know you said that the sort of growth from those that will be turning 65, that\u2019s a positive. But if we think about this business when you first had a big bump up and then it was sort of like it was a onetime thing, you got it and it just sort of stayed there. Would you think about this bump here as sort of we go to a new level on and it\u2019s kind of another plateau?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, if we continue to stay below that median, it will be more of a growth. It will be more growth going forward. For example, we\u2019re going to add immediately pick up 76,000 people, but we will be adding about 2,000 new people net each month. So it will be \u2013 by the end of the next year, we should have grown by about 100,000 people through the auto enrollees. Those new people turning 65 will continue to add to that. So I would expect it to contribute some growth going forward. Not as much as obviously it will make.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then the final question is your Life premium, I think, was up 3% this quarter. Your Health premium was down 6%. Given all of the sales numbers that you\u2019re anticipating next year and the sales that have happened recently, are these numbers that should be relatively stable next year? I mean in terms of the growth rates, we don\u2019t see any real pickup in those. Like is Health going to continue to decline mid single-digits, Life maybe grow a few percent and we won\u2019t start to see growth until \u201813?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, hold on just a second here. I\u2019ve got more detailed numbers. If I look at our total Life premium, I think we\u2019re \u2013 at our midpoint, we\u2019re expecting a little over 4% growth in our Life premium. So I think that\u2019s slightly better than where it\u2019s at today. On the Health side, we\u2019re still expecting about 6% decline in our Health premiums for next year. So that\u2019s at the midpoint of our guidance. So I think that\u2019s a fair statement.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I mean in buybacks, are we sort of assuming that like typically all free cash flow used for buybacks or is there any difference in what you\u2019re assuming in the guidance?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well obviously again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate each quarter. But right now, we feel comfortable with really about $50 million cushion. We want to keep that for the end of the year just until we know for sure what our year-end RBC is going to be. And again borrowing acquisition potentials or if there\u2019s anything else, we still believe that share repurchase is a good use for it. And right now I don\u2019t see any reason to hold more than that for a cushion.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So in terms \u2013 so, when you think about your guidance, you\u2019re assuming that whatever free cash flow you generate in 2012 is used buyback stock.", "Mark McAndrew", "That\u2019s correct. In our guidance, we had assumed we would use basically our free cash. We\u2019ve assumed at different price levels, but we have basically assumed that we would use it to repurchase stock.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can Gary remind us what that number \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve given us anything on that number expectation for next year.", "Mark McAndrew", "Gary, free cash next year, we anticipate being about $360 million?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, it should be around $350 million to $360 million. We didn\u2019t just base on our preliminary estimate.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay and that\u2019s after dividends?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Edward Spehar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "(inaudible) okay. Thanks a lot guys.", "Mark McAndrew", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeffrey Schuman with KBW. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Thank you. Hello. I think Ed got me started on this, but maybe we can continue. I\u2019m struggling to contemplate the 2012 guidance particularly after you\u2019re now telling us that it incorporates the impact of the DAC change. So the midpoint range is 525. If we back up the impact of the DAC change, it will be 530 to 535 and that\u2019s against the consensus of 510. I\u2019m kind of running out of ways to rationalize that because I think as you run through the premium numbers, I think probably most of us are too far off there. I think most of us know what to anticipate in share repurchase. Conservation is only (inaudible) issue. Part D sounds like some upside. Obviously, you don\u2019t reconcile against our models. But I mean, what other thing should be on our list to think about?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I guess that\u2019s where no doubt the impact of share repurchase is a big item. And we don\u2019t get to \u2013 we said at the beginning of this year, we wouldn\u2019t get the full impact of the United Investors sale until first, second quarter of next year. It was actually dilutive by $0.05 to $0.10 per share this year and it will be accretive next year as we get the benefit of that.", "But other things, the expense reductions we\u2019ve seen at Liberty National. Again, we\u2019ve closed 90 offices in the last 12 months and those expenses are going to obviously expenses that would no longer be deferrable. Those expense changes will add about $0.11. But the part D we\u2019ve increased will add about $0.05. The change in the underwriting and Direct Response, will add about $0.02 after tax. So, there\u2019s a number of different factors adding to its. But still share repurchase at the current multiple if we would have been double-digit growth in earnings per share this year without the United Investors sale. So, and I\u2019m not again, we don\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t reconcile to your model but it\u2019s even at the beginning of this year, it\u2019s not far off where we thought we would be.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay. That\u2019s all helpful. I mean the share repurchase is powerful although I think most of us probably can\u2019t have that already worked in probably the Liberty expenses, the part D, a couple of the other things maybe not so much. So that\u2019s our helpful thoughts. Thanks.", "Gary Coleman", "You welcome.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Colin Devine with Citi. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Good morning. I have just, I guess, sort of gray areas I\u2019d like to talk about. First on Liberty, Mark, I think we\u2019re now at least 27 quarters in terms of the agent force shrinking and particularly the sort of not the first of your agents but the renewal agents which are similar in driving a lot of the sales here. Where do you think that finally bottoms? Is it going to be next year? You talked about I guess growing the number of managers, what does it take to sort of get that to finally turnaround, would be question number one.", "Question number two. Have you given any thought to changing the dividend policy to maybe doing a little more in dividends than buybacks? And then the last one, on the M&A front, certainly you mentioned in the past you\u2019ve looked at some things. Is there anything else out there that you could do that might help to give Liberty sort of a booster side here?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Liberty National, that is still the biggest question mark that we have. And again, I feel good about the changes that we\u2019ve made. I think they were received well. But the next, I would say 90 days, next three to four months is really going to really see how well those changes were received. We have made them much more businessmen, much more entrepreneurs versus just managing our offices.", "The one big thing, Colin, that you need to remember, regardless of the level of sales going forward, we have moved most of the fixed expenses at Liberty into variable expenses. So the least the margins on the business that we write at Liberty National will be predictable going forward. But again, I can\u2019t \u2013 I believe that by the first of the year, we will be at our low point at Liberty National. But only \u2013 we\u2019re really going to have to wait and see what that is.", "We\u2019re still expecting a small decline, again, in our Life sales although we do expect our Health sales to pick up. But I think the next three or four months will definitely, we\u2019ll have a better answer to that. As far as dividend goes and buyback, we definitely discussed that. We had been slowly raising our dividend each year for the last several years. But it still comes down to \u2013 at the current PE that we\u2019re trading at, we still believe buyback is a very good use of the money.", "But it is something particularly if we get in a very low interest rate environment, we obviously could pay a much higher dividend. But at this point, there\u2019s no definite plans to change our dividend policy. That might change if the PE comes up some. As far as M&A, I don\u2019t \u2013 particularly right now, until we see some positive results at Liberty National, I would be, in fact, I would just say I would not be interested in buying another home service company.", "Even though the pricing maybe attractive on it. You\u2019d almost have to look at it as a close block of business because particularly, the changes in bank accounting, it\u2019s very difficult to show a GAAP profit in a home service business. So I don\u2019t see anything on the short-term horizon there.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Well, Mark, and just sort of following up then. (Inaudible) you mentioned that obviously the change in the DAC accounting. With what you\u2019ve been able to do now at Liberty, at the very least, have you made then Torchmark\u2019s earnings less sensitive to the pace of improvement at Liberty under the new rules because you\u2019ve moved to this variable comp system?", "Mark McAndrew", "Absolutely, Colin. There\u2019s no doubt. And the change in the DAC accounting, even though these were plans that we have been moving towards for a number of years, the change in the DAC accounting definitely sped up our plan to move it \u2013 to eliminate those fixed expenses and move them to more variable expense.", "So it does \u2013 when people wonder why we\u2019re not more impacted by the change of the DAC accounting, the change at Liberty National is a big piece of that, that we have moved the bulk, not only the office expenses but the lead expenses we were picking up. We have eliminated those and moved them to the branch manager.", "Colin Devine \u2013 Citi", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Mark McAndrew", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the side of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hey. Thanks. Just want to go back to the interest rate disclosures that Gary gave at the top of the call. Could you just cover again what the rate increase is going to be in your Life book? Well, first of all and then I have a follow up.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, what I mentioned was is that for the American Income Life policies and our juvenile policies, we\u2019re going to raise the premiums on newly issued policies by 5%.", "Mark McAndrew", "Randy, I\u2019ll just even \u2013 a year ago, we were talking and we talked about the impact of lower interest rate crediting on the profitability of our Life businesses. And we said 100 basis point reduction in our interest rate crediting had about 1% to 3% \u2013 it would take 1% to 3% increase on our rates to offset that. We did lower this year in 2011 our interest rate crediting on new business from like 6.75% down to 5.75% but we did not adjust our rates.", "Well, if the interest rates continue to decline the way most people think they will, we\u2019re just trying to get ahead of the game. And assuming that we may have to lower our interest rate crediting again, next year, we are going ahead in January 1, we will have rate increases in effect roughly 5% of both American Income and some of the products in Direct Response.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And so the elasticity of pricing though is \u2013 I mean, you have fair amount of ability to change price on these target markets, right?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "I mean AI is a very strong controlled distribution. That\u2019s a sold product. I mean, so do you have much competition you think about and how they\u2019re changing pricing or do you just think about what\u2019s best for Torchmark?", "Mark McAndrew", "We think mostly about what\u2019s \u2013 more so on the Direct Response. We do rate testing and determine optimum pricing levels. But for the most part, we price our products to achieve desired profitability. American Income is not in a highly competitive marketplace. We have looked in the past and it\u2019s only been a handful of policies a month that are replaced by another company. It\u2019s really not an issue at American Income. So I feel confident that it won\u2019t have any negative impact. We raised rates slightly back, I guess, it was 1999 and it had no impact on sales there. In fact, actually the next three years, sales doubled.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "That\u2019s helpful. So I mean the takeaway here is that it\u2019s the liability offset to the lower yields that we all model and so that keeps the margin. And then just really quick, if I could, because I just didn\u2019t get followed up on. But Gary, on your interest rate scenario, I guess I just wanted to confirm that the takeaway there was a spread on underwriting. Is there a way to communicate your scenario just on kind of how much base, how many basis points the overall yield on the portfolio would lose in that scenario?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, that\u2019s what \u2013 I think I mentioned it.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "And maybe we\u2019re talking about the same thing and I misunderstood it.", "Gary Coleman", "What I was saying, currently portfolio is at 653 and what I was saying is we invest at 4.75. All the cash flow each year for the next five years.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Five years, yeah.", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s 653 declines to depending on different scenarios but a decline to 595 basis points to 610 basis points...", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "At the end of the five-year period.", "Gary Coleman", "At the end of the five-year period, that\u2019s what the portfolio yield would be.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And so in that scenario that your overall portfolio would lose 35 basis points?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yeah, 35 to 50, somewhere in that range", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Point to point over the five years or each year?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, at the end of five years.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, at the end of five years. Let\u2019s just say that in between it\u2019s gone from 6.53% to 6%. At the end of the fifth year, the portfolio yield would be 6%.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "We would lose 50 basis points, but we\u2019d lose that over a five-year period.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "So 10 a year?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "And that would be step function down? That would be a linear kind of boost of 10 each year as your model ended up?", "Gary Coleman", "It wouldn\u2019t be 10 exactly but it would be something...", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah.", "Gary Coleman", "...that\u2019s around there.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "No, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the clarification.", "Gary Coleman", "Sure.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yeah", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "Thanks very much. It\u2019s actually Jack Sherck in for Mark. I may have disconnected, I had hopped off for a second. But what I was wondering about was the increase in the response rate to 43% on the inserts were over 16% last quarter, I know you revamped your strategy there and the actual insert itself. When does that go into play and do you attribute that to anything else or just a better marketing or a better advertising fee?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, we really rolled out with that in the second quarter. And even though we saw improvement in our initial response rates in the insert media, which is why we increased our circulation in the third and fourth quarters as a result of the improvements we saw in the second quarter. And I do attribute it. It\u2019s significantly \u2013 it\u2019s a rather large change in the packaging in those inserts and that\u2019s what has caused that increase.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "So...", "Mark McAndrew", "It\u2019s about a 17% improvement in the response rate.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "Right. So in your view, it\u2019s more of the marketing piece itself rather than the change in the environment.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "First of all, good luck tonight and hope you guys pop some champagne.", "Gary Coleman", "We\u2019re planning on it.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Are you heading there to St. Louis or are you just going to watch it live?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I might go up for game seven if it goes seven.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Yes. Good luck. I\u2019m (inaudible). I\u2019m with you. Tax rate came down a little bit (inaudible). Is the full nine-month rate a good sort of run rate? You had talked before about some tax things that you were doing. So I was wondering if could expand on that.", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, the main reason of tax rate that came down is we got increased tax benefits from our investment and low income housing tax credits. And that brought the rate down to just about 32%, where it had been 33.7%. What we expect to happen is we\u2019ll end the year at 32.7% and that should be about the rate we have in 2012. But it\u2019s all due to getting increased tax expenses that we were expecting of those investments.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Such a little bit of help in Mr. Schuman\u2019s answer for Jeff\u2019s question for next year\u2019s tax rate is left fielder positive going into next year.", "Gary Coleman", "Right. Yeah, it\u2019s going to be about 33.7% to 32.7%. So we\u2019re picking up a percent there.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "And I apologize, you were fading out on just the cash flow dynamics of the fourth quarter. Just to remind me, your cash is $168 million at the end of the third quarter.", "Mark McAndrew", "I think it was $166 million.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, $166 million.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "And what dividends are you getting?", "Gary Coleman", "We\u2019re only getting the addition to the cash flow for the quarter will be $6 million. So that would give us $172 million available. But we\u2019ve already spent $14 million.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Right, I got that. And you said you could take that to $50 million?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yeah, (inaudible) cushion.", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. That\u2019s it. Thank you.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Mark McAndrew", "John?", "Operator", "John, your line is open. Please go ahead, John.", "Mark McAndrew", "I think we lost him.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) It looks like we have a follow up from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "No. It has been answered. I didn\u2019t know how to turn it off.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions.", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we will talk to you again next quarter. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This does conclude your teleconference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mark McAndrew, Chairman and CEO of Torchmark Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $128 million or $1.25 per share. A per share increase of 12% from a year ago. Net income for the fourth quarter was $126 million or $1.23 per share, a 4% decline on a per share basis. For the full year, operating income per share grew 10% to $4.68 while net income per share increased 12% to $4.72. Excluding FAS 115, on return on equity 14.2% for the quarter and our book value per share was $35.59, a 9% increase from a year ago.", "On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value grew 25% for the year to $41.54 per share. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 4% to $432 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $121 million. Net life sales for the quarter increased 5% to $81 million. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $157 million and life underwriting margin was up 5% to $51 million. Net life sales increased 11% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at year-end was 4381, up 12% from a year ago. I continue to be excited by the growth prospects of American Income.", "While the agent count dipped slightly in the fourth quarter, it has rebounded strongly in January to over 4600. Our middle sales management ranks have grown 29% in the past year. As expected, we saw double digit life sales growth in the fourth quarter which we expect to continue throughout 2012. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $146 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 6% to $36 million.", "Net life sales were up 8% to $33 million. We are beginning to see the impact on the increase in certain media circulation which we began in the third quarter. We expect to see similar or better sales growth through at least the first three quarter of 2012. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 3% to $71 million and life underwriting margin was down 1% to $16 million. Net life sales declined 23% to $8 million while net health sales grew 43% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National at year-end was 1345, down 33% for the year.", "Since our last call, we have made some management changes at Liberty National. Roger Smith, the CEO of American Income has also been appointed CEO of Liberty National, and Steve DiChiaro, a very successful SGA at American Income, was brought in as Chief Marketing Officer. These management changes have been very well received by the Liberty National sales force and I am optimistic that we will begin to see a turnaround at Liberty National in the next 6 to 9 months.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 5% to $179 million, and health underwriting margin also declined 5% to $34 million. Health net sales grew 7% in the quarter to $21 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 5% to $48 million, while underwriting margin was down 23% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter increase to $97 million versus $14 million a year ago, primarily as a result of low income subsidized enrollees which we discussed on the last call.", "The volume of business form new low income subsidized enrollees who turned 65, has been a positive development. While we expected to enroll roughly 2000 per month, for January and February we have averaged closer to 6000. We now expect to add 50,000 to 75000 additional enrollees turning 65 in 2012 versus our prior estimate of 24000. Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, up 2% from a year ago and in line with our expectations.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer, for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2011. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.4 billion, including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages.", "Of the fixed maturities, $10.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $701 million compared to $863 million a year ago. The $162 million decline this year is due primarily to $140 million of dispositions and $22 million of net upgrades. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.4%, compared to 8.3% at the end of 2010. With a portfolio of leverage at three times, the percentage of below-investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%, which is less than most of our peers.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago. We have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $964 million compared to gains of $942 million at the end of the third quarter, and $108 million a year ago. The increase in unrealized gains in the fourth quarter is due primarily to slight declines in treasury yields and credit spreads. Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $273 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.22%, an average rating of A minus and an average life of 28 years. For the year, we invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 5.65% and an average rating of A minus.", "For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.52% compared to 6.54% in the previous quarter and 6.65% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of December 31, yield on the portfolio is 6.49%. Regarding RBC, as we have said before we plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last few years that level has been around an NASC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in the light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Although we haven\u2019t finalized our 2011 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/11 will be around the 325% target. Now regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the fourth quarter we used $67 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares. For the year, we spent $788 million to acquire 18.9 million shares or 16% of the diluted outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. At December 31, the parent company had liquid assets of $74 million. In addition to these assets the parents will generate additional free cash in 2012. We define annual free cash flow as a dividend received from the subsidiaries less interest expense and less the dividends paid to our shareholders.", "Assuming shareholder dividends at the current level, we expect free cash flow in 2012 to be around $350 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $74 million of assets on hand, we will have approximately $425 million to $435 million of cash available to the parent during the year. To date in 2012, we have used $16 million of this cash to buy 355,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If marketing conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.", "Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. As of January 1,2012, the company will adopt ASU 2010-26, which changes the rules regarding the deferral acquisition cost. This standard will change the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred currently will now be deferred under the new rules. However, it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows, or statutory earnings. We will elect to adopt the new rules retroactively, which means that DAC will be written down to the level as if the new standard has been in place from prior periods.", "Going forward, the earnings impact will be the combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down. We currently estimate that the retroactive write-down will be around 16% of the current DAC assets, which will result in around a 10% reduction in GAAP equity excluding net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturities. In addition, we expect that 2012 earnings will be 1% to 2% or $0.06 to $0.08 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules. And that ROE, excluding net unrealized gains or losses, will rise from the current 14% level to 15%, to 16%. These estimates were included in our guidance for 2012.", "Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. For 2012, we continue to expect our net operating income per share will be in a range of $5.10 to $5.40 per share. And those are my comments for this morning. Gwyn, I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Thank you, good morning. First for Mark, on recruiting trends. You mentioned that the American Income agent count recovered a bit, but if you could just give us an idea on what caused the decline in the fourth quarter and your outlook for agents there? Then also at Liberty National, the agent count dropped. I think you obviously made a lot of changes in December in that business. Should we expect another drop in the agent count there or has most of the disruption already occurred? And then lastly, Gary, you mentioned the $350 million to $360 million of free cash flow. You gave numbers for cash at the holding company but I missed those, so if you could just repeat those as well?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Well, first off, Jimmy, on as far as American Income recruiting -- and I\u2019m not sure if it was the way the holidays fell, we did see a drop off the last couple of weeks of the year which caused a little dip there. The fourth quarter is never a particularly strong recruiting quarter for us although the January and early February resulted in very strong -- recruiting is up significantly and our agent retention is improving and the middle management counts are growing. So, I feel very good about where it\u2019s at. Actually, if I look at the agent count at the end of January, we\u2019re up 24% from where we were at the same time a year ago.", "So, I am very optimistic about where American Income is. At Liberty National, I think, I have all the confidence in the world in Roger and Steve but, realistically, I think it\u2019s going to take six months to get to recruiting and training and sales processes in place at Liberty. I think we\u2019ll see the declines slow, but I would still expect to probably see a small decline in the first quarter and hopefully a turnaround from there. But I really think it will be the second half of the year before we really see the results of the turnaround at Liberty. Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, Jimmy, as I said at the beginning of the year we have $74 million of cash on hand and we\u2019ll supplement that with cash this year, additional cash of $350 million or $360 million of free cash flow.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Okay. And most of that -- how much do you intend to -- I think you mentioned most of that you intend to use for buybacks, but how much would you want to keep just as a cushion out of that amount?", "Gary Coleman", "I think we\u2019d probably want to keep a cushion of around $50 million, maybe a little bit higher. I think there is no specific need of whatever they were targeting. We just feel like we should have some cushion and that number feels about right.", "Mark McAndrew", "Jimmy, the midpoint of our guidance, we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to spend about $90 million a quarter on share repurchase.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Okay. Got you. And then, just following up on the Liberty comments. Have you seen -- and you mentioned the agent count being up at American Income, but at Liberty, have you seen the agent count drop further so far this quarter?", "Mark McAndrew", "As of now, it\u2019s down about 4% from where it was at year-end. So it\u2019s still down a little bit from where we were at year-end.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "Hey, thanks. Just on Liberty National, appreciate the comments on the management change there, but it seems like we\u2019ve been talking about, you all have been talking about things you can do there, which has included I think closing offices and potentially changing product profiles and maybe compensation. But if you could elaborate on kind of what else the new management team there might change going forward. I\u2019d be interested to kind of get a little bit more color on what they might expect to improve at Liberty?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, the main thing, Randy, is really getting more organized in our recruiting and training of new agents. We, at American Income, we have systems in place where it is an ongoing every week process of here is how you recruit, and every SGA that we have there is recruiting every week and the middle management team that we have there is, they\u2019re recruiting on a weekly basis. We just need to implement similar processes at Liberty National and that really hasn\u2019t been put in place in the past. So, it\u2019s primarily about improving the recruiting and training processes at Liberty. And again, we\u2019re starting with a handful of offices and then we\u2019ll expand it from there. But realistically, it\u2019s going to take us six to nine months, I think, to get all of the Liberty offices on board with those processes.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "And so, you don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll have to close -- I guess two-follows ups would be -- you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to close any more offices and I guess what I am hearing is that you think this is something that can be addressed. It\u2019s not a macro issue of trouble getting folks to sign up for a commission sales job, gas prices or anything like that. You really think it\u2019s, I guess you\u2019re not going to have to close more offices and you think it\u2019s really isolated to training or recruiting.", "Mark McAndrew", "Now when we had Liberty managers meeting here a couple of weeks ago where we introduced Roger and Steve to them, and basically I told I\u2019m -- we\u2019re through closing offices. No, I don\u2019t expect the number of offices to decline further. I think the managers that we have are enthusiastic. We just need to show them a little better how to recruit and how to train, and I have all the confidence in the world that by the end of 2012 we\u2019ll see a turnaround there.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Sarah DeWitt with Barclays Capital.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Hi, good morning. How are you thinking about the growth in the health earnings longer term? Is this now a growth business for you and if not, what do you view as the end game for that business?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, our emphasis is going to continue to be on the life, but we are seeing some improvement in the Medicare supplement marketplace, which is a market we\u2019ve been in since the 1960s. So it\u2019s a business we\u2019re very comfortable with. And particularly we\u2019re seeing actually, on our general agency and direct response, we\u2019re actually seeing some growth in our Medicare supplement sales as well as our premiums. I Don\u2019t expect to see any -- we\u2019re not anticipating major growth there but we\u2019ll take all of that business we can get.", "So I think over the next three or five years I think we\u2019ll start to see some growth in our Medicare supplement line of business. Liberty National, most of their growth in health sales are coming from supplemental products sold through the worksite, similarly to the AFLAC type products. We\u2019re very comfortable with those products, have been selling them for a number of years and we expect to see continued growth in that marketplace. So, in those specific markets we\u2019re very comfortable with the products that we have and I think we\u2019ll continue to see growth in those health sales.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Great. And then, what are your expectations for the Part D sales in 2012 based on the higher enrollment that you\u2019re seeing?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, that is, as I mentioned, a positive. Where we did pick up about 77,000 new people at beginning of the year and where we were anticipating picking up 2,000 a month. It\u2019s been running closer to 6,000 a month, people turning 65. And the average premium on that, monthly premium is right at $100. So, you can multiply that out. It is -- well let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got it here somewhere. We started the year, I believe, with $195 million of annual premium in-force. By year-end, we expect that to be about $328 million of in-force. I think we expect to have about a little over $300 million of collected premium for the year.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Paul Sarran with Evercore Partners.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Good morning. A couple of questions. I guess first, given the decline at Liberty, can you talk about whether it still makes sense to run it as a separate company apart from American Income? Second, I was hoping that you could help us reconcile some capital figures from the third quarter to year-end. I think there was $166 million of capital at the holdco at the third quarter. I was hoping you could walk us through how you get down to $74 million. And then just lastly, do you still see buybacks as the most likely use for your free cash flow this year or is there anything on the acquisition front you might be interested in?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay, I\u2019ll take the first one. As far as Liberty, it does still make sense to operate as a separate company. American Income, there are enough differences between the two that it would be very difficult to merge the two. American Income agents are all unionized. They are all union members, which is a niche that we like, but, and it still comes down to, even though all new agents that we\u2019re hiring at Liberty National are independent contractors, the existing agents and management continue to be employees which would not work well in the American Income environment. Liberty National has a good name in its market and we believe it can grow on its own. So we intend to continue to operate it as a separate entity. Gary, you want to talk about the capital?", "Gary Coleman", "Sure, yeah, Paul, we started the quarter with $166 million. The free cash for just the fourth quarter, and again, that\u2019s dividend less the interest expense, and our dividend payments for the shareholders was $13 million. That gets you to $179 million. From that we used $68 million for share repurchases and we also used $25,000 to make a capital contribution to one of our insurance subsidiaries. And then that leaves another $12 million that was a net of several different parent company expenses. But if you net all those down, you get down to the $74 million.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. And was there anything specific that prompted the contribution to the insurance company?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, the primary reason for that is there was a -- the NAIC changed the way it treats some trust preferred or hybrid securities. And depending on the level of the purchase price versus the par value, there they raised the capital requirements for those particular bonds and so that was unexpected, that was adopted during the year. And so this additional $25 million is put down there just to make sure that we stayed around our 325% target.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. And then the question on buybacks or use of free cash flow?", "Mark McAndrew", "Paul, overall, as far as the acquisition front, we continue to keep our eyes open. We continue to talk to investment bankers. But right now still don\u2019t see anything on the short-term horizon that we\u2019re interested in. As far as buybacks versus dividends, we\u2019ve been gradually increasing our dividends last few years. We\u2019re still -- we\u2019re at a lower yield than our peers. We may see some acceleration in the dividends, but again what we\u2019ve been doing, if you look at our free cash including money spent for dividends, we\u2019re running about $400 million to $410 million a year. We\u2019ve been using about $50 million for dividends. We may see that go up a little bit, but we still expect the bulk of it to be used for share repurchase.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeffrey Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about lapse rates and conservation. If I look at your life insurance lapse rate exhibit that you publish, I mean the lapse rates do move around from quarter to quarter. They are impacted by the mix of first year and renewal, but on the surface it certainly looks like the lapse rates are trending better. Do you think that\u2019s a real trend and is it related to the conservation efforts, or how do you see that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I definitely think it\u2019s a real trend, particularly at American Income, which again, that\u2019s where we focused our initial efforts. We\u2019re seeing some positive trend. In fact I didn\u2019t really mention it in my comments, but our new initiatives this year on conservation, we conserved just over $12 million of annualized premium. Now about half of that was at American Income. Next year we expect those initiatives conserve over $31 million of premium, is our estimate right now. So we\u2019re starting to see some impact and that\u2019s a reason we started publishing that exhibit, but I think we\u2019ll see more of an impact over the next 12 to 24 months as we continue to expand those conservation initiatives.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. Good morning. I guess one of the things I was surprised by was the increase in the discount rate, albeit, modestly. Just curious kind of what\u2019s driving the increase there given the continued decline in the effective portfolio yield?", "Gary Coleman", "Chris, it\u2019s really due to the mix of business. You\u2019ll remember that most of our life business is protection type business. So not accrediting interest to policyholder accounts, the discount rate is truly a discount rate used to calculate the reserves. And for policies issued in 2011, we did drop the discount rate to 5.75% which in prior years have been leaning closer to 6.5%. But the 2011 issues we\u2019re having, this is a small impact when you look at the overall block of business that we have. And so, the increase is coming from the fact that they have more of the business at those higher rates for the few years prior to 2011. But I think the right way is, it\u2019s not going to go up much from here, and in the long run it will start trending down.", "Mark McAndrew", "Actually, Chris, as far as new business written in 2012, as Gary mentioned, we did lower the discount rate for business issued in 2011. We expect to lower that some more for the business written in 2012, although we will shed more light on that on the next call.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And are you thinking, I mean because your effective kind of new money yield here in quarter was 5.2%, so, should we be thinking about sort of an adjustment to the discount rate down somewhere closer to that level?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, actually, it could be a little bit lower. I think in the last call, we gave some assumptions what would happen over the next five years if we invested at 4.75%. And we also talked about maybe dropping the discount rate to 4.75% on 2012 issues. As Mark said, we\u2019ll decide on that in the first quarter, but I think it will be lower in the 5.22% and it may be lower than 5%.", "Mark McAndrew", "But, Chris, you need to understand that that\u2019s only on new business issued.", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "And in, again, the midpoint of our guidance, we\u2019ve assumed that we were going to lower it to 4.75, graded up to 6.5 over seven years, is what we\u2019ve included in our guidance. Doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use, but that is what we\u2019ve estimated on our guidance.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just finally, in terms of new money you\u2019re lowering the ratings, extending durations to try and protect the yields, but just curious to see if you\u2019re exploring any additional sort of investment strategies to help preserve yields. Whether it\u2019s mortgage loans or alternative asset classes or you are going to kind of continue the same strategy you have been doing?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, first of all, we are not extending durations. We\u2019ve been investing in these durations for quite a few years and it all gets back to asset liability matching. Our liabilities are very long. Now also in terms of quality, we haven\u2019t stepped down in quality. We have been at A minus level for new purchases for quite some time. I think there was one quarter we went down to BBB plus. But we really haven\u2019t changed anything. We\u2019re being consistent with our investment strategy in the past. We look at alternative assets, but we have stayed away from mortgage loans as I mentioned in the beginning, stayed away from all -- whether it\u2019s residential or commercial or whatever. And I think we feel more comfortable with investment grade corporate bonds and we don\u2019t like the lower yields but we feel better with the credit of those assets, the credit quality and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to stay with.", "Mark McAndrew", "Right. And also Chris as mentioned on the last call, we can adjust to lower interest rates. We did put through some rate increases January 1, in both Direct Response and American Income to offset the lower investment yield. We feel very comfortable with our investment strategy. We feel like it served us very well for a number of years now, and we expect to continue to that.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Hey, good morning, everybody. I got three here, mostly some follow-ups I think. Just to follow-up on Chris\u2019 question with regards to discount rate. Mark or Gary, could you remind us if you were to lower the discount rate to 4.75%, what would that do to your pricing?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again we did a study about a year ago. 100 basis points decline -- to reduce it 100 basis points caused us to, it would be 1% to 3% in most of our products. Would take 1% to 3% rate adjustment to offset 100 basis points lowering of discount rate. We put through about 5% increase at both American Income and some of the direct response products, January 1. So we feel like we\u2019re ahead of that game.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Great. And then, Genworth, in their conference call mentioned and issue with regards to GAAP accounting, and level term life insurance, I think that\u2019s a product that you guys provide. Are you aware of this of have any thoughts on it?", "Mark McAndrew", "You want to take that Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "I am really not aware. Can you give more detail?", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Yeah, as far as I understand, it has to do with the idea that a product conversion when the level term runs out, the pricing is significantly higher, which could lead to a situation where reserves go negative on these policies. Genworth had historically used the reserves as a negative and has decided to put a floor in the reserves to zero, so they can\u2019t have negative reserves?", "Mark McAndrew", "Gary?", "", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry Steven. I really don\u2019t have an answer for that.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I\u2019ll point out, Steven, actually if you look at our business, most of our business is whole life. At American Income, Liberty National most of it\u2019s whole life, even in the direct response. We showed some term business in direct response, but it\u2019s termed to 100 or termed to 95. They are very long-term policies that we really don\u2019t see conversions.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, great.", "Mark McAndrew", "So it\u2019s really not been an issue with us.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, and then one more, if I could. With regards to LNL and beating that dead horse. I am fascinated by the trends within the new recruits and the veteran agents. Veteran agents being up, new recruits being down. On the new recruit side, is this a function of -- you\u2019ve said in the past, Mark, LNL was a place you went to work when you were looking for work.", "Mark McAndrew", "I remember that comment.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Has that really changed and is that what\u2019s driving the new recruits down and then what\u2019s leading to the veterans up?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, there\u2019s no doubt closing as many offices as we did. Again we went from a 130 offices down to 70 in a little over a year. And part of the reason for that was just to get the expenses in line and get the profitability of the business up where it needs to be. So that had a big impact on recruiting. When you go from 130 managers down to 70, it\u2019s going to impact the number of new agents we recruit. As far as, in fact I am looking at that number, I don\u2019t really have an answer, Steven, for why that went from 552 to 648 on the veteran agents. I\u2019ll look into it and I can have Mike get back to you on that.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Great. And one more follow up if I could on this. You mentioned not closing anymore offices. I think you\u2019ve discussed in the past that you could lose maybe a third of the officers due to the changes that you made. Do you think that\u2019s still an accurate assessment?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, I don\u2019t think it is anymore. We\u2019ve had -- since the last call, we\u2019ve actually had two meetings, one prior to the management -- well, one about the time of the last call. We had another meeting, and the attitudes there are extremely good. The last meeting we had was the most positive meeting that I can ever recall having at Liberty. So, I don\u2019t -- we might lose a handful of managers but I think we have people to replace them. So, we don\u2019t anticipate closing off or I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll lose a third of the managers now.", "Operator", "And we will go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Hi, good morning, everybody. I was just thinking about, and maybe Gary\u2019s commentary about the trust preferreds brought me back to it. Just thinking about the -- you guys had relatively large holdings in regional bank trust preferreds on the balance sheet. I think as we watch over the past several months at least. We\u2019ve been seeing more and more activity where these banks are redeeming these trust preferreds. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen or if you expect to see some of that type of activity with your holdings and what kind of reinvestment risk that might put you under to the extent you guys take proceeds and reinvest it 5.22% or lower?", "Gary Coleman", "John, I think we\u2019ve only seen a couple issues called, and they were smaller ones. But we do have just under $750 million of bank trust preferreds, hybrids that would -- that are contingent calls. And we expect a large number of those to be called but up until recently, with the expectation that those calls would occur in 2013. But as you mentioned there is talk that some of the banks are instead avoiding for the change and that was tied to the change in the Tier 1 capital rules, but now there is some indications that some banks will say, well, when these rules are issued in 2012 that will be the triggering event that\u2019ll allow them to call the securities.", "So, we really don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work out, whether there will be sizable amount in 2012 or it will be 2013. You\u2019re right, it will have an impact on our yield. The yields on those are just little over 7%. And if we refinance or reinvest at 4.75%, it would be a significant change to the yield. In the last call, we talked about, if we invested in rates at 4.75% for the next five years, what would happen to the portfolio yield and I think what we said at five years from now and so yield of 6.49% as it does today, the portfolio would be yielding 6%. Well in that, in those projections, we assume that these trust preferreds would be called and that the money would be reinvested at 4.75%. So, that projection is still good, the question is though, if it will, some of them happen in 2012 and we just don\u2019t know.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just at the margin too, would you expect, particularly after the injection of the capital under the rule change, would you expect that, all else equal, if you\u2019re investing like you are today at roughly A minus that the risk-based capital requirements when you make that shift out of TruPS into higher grade corporate, do you expect the required capital to fall a bit?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, it should, because as I mentioned earlier they have increased the capital charges on those trust preferreds. So I don\u2019t know how much the impact, but that would -- well, it would have a fairly significant impact on the capital. So that will be a plus.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thank you. And then I joined a little bit late and I am sorry if I missed this, maybe you addressed it, but obviously the Medicare Part D sales were extremely strong. Could you just give us, could you just remind us how to think about the pattern of the earned premium?", "Mark McAndrew", "Okay. Sure, John. Again we picked up -- well first off, the average monthly premium, we get premiums monthly, is right at $100, $98.86 on these auto-enrollees. We picked up 77,000 of those at the beginning of the year January 1. Actually -- and we had anticipated picking up an additional 2,000 people turning 65 each month, but through the first couple of months, that has actually run close through the 6,000 a month. So we now expect to pick up somewhere in the 50,000 to 75,000 additional enrollees turning 65 and again the monthly premium is right at $100. So you can -- I did make the comment that, if I look at total revenue, we had $197 million I think in 2011. We expect that to go to, our current estimate and our guidance is $306 million. I think maybe a little higher than that.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. And I recall in the press release no expectation of any meaningful change in your margin on that premium?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, we expect to continue roughly the same margin we had this year.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "So, just following the math on John\u2019s question, which was 75% (margin). It means the 29 million of Medicare earnings will grow into the 40s, that will be a pretty good source of earnings growth. When you get into this Part D, I think originally, you guys said that this would be a good base of earnings with a good return on capital that would sort of grade down. Now it looks like it actually could be a source of earnings growth, prospectively?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, definitely for 2012 it is, Bob, and it\u2019s something we are already looking at what can we do for 2013 to not only hold on to what we have but hopefully increase the volume of auto enrollees that we receive. So, if we can -- assuming we can at least hold on to the 21 regions that we\u2019re getting auto-enrollees, it would become a significant area of growth for us.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay. I was wondering -- is Roger Smith on the call, is available for questions or no?", "Mark McAndrew", "No, he\u2019s not.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Okay.", "Mark McAndrew", "We might consider that in future quarters.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Well, I was going to say now that he is running two key business units, he\u2019s obviously quite busy.", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes, he is.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "I can understand that. He\u2019s got things to work on now, but it\u2019ll be good for us to get some -- or him to have some visibility to investors, so we could see what he\u2019s focusing on, how he compares and contrasts Liberty to American Income. Because they are two different markets that you\u2019re applying sort of the same mousetrap of recruiting to. So, I was just wondering what nuances he is picking up and focusing on and where the opportunity is. But it sounds like, your answer for him is blocking and tackling and recruiting.", "Mark McAndrew", "That\u2019s basically right Bob. They have become much more similar than what they were a year ago, two years ago, five years ago. And the basics of recruiting and training agents in markets are very similar. But I will think about your comment and at least try to get him on maybe one call here of the next two, I\u2019ll try to have him on.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you. Refresh me on what drives the sustainability on that very good pace of 6000 per month? What could make that go higher or lower? You mentioned you\u2019re getting the 21 regions with the auto-enrollees. How do you pick up more share there?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, again, I think there is 34 total regions. I think we\u2019re getting the auto-enrollees in 21 of the 34. So, there is obviously 13 that we\u2019re not. So, we\u2019re looking there. Any place that our plan is below the median cost in that region, then we pick a portion of the low income subsidized. So, that is something we\u2019re looking at, or other ways that we can continue to shape a few dollars off of our premium to keep it below the median or actually get it below the median in some of the markets that we\u2019re not in. So, we\u2019re continuing to look at ways to be a little more price competitive.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. And how about outlook in 2012 for insert volume on the direct front marketing activity. Any interesting plans for the next few quarters?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, we significantly increased the volumes in second half of 2011, which we\u2019re starting to see the results of. Right now, at least for the first two quarters of 2012, we\u2019re just anticipating the circulation to increase 7% to 8% above a year ago. That could change as we go through the year, but right now that\u2019s our current anticipation of the volume for the first half.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, those are our comments for today. Thank you for joining us. I hope you have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please note that this call is being recorded and is also being simultaneously webcast.", "At this time I will turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark McAndrew. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2010 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Net operating income for the first quarter was $128 million or $1.27 per share, a per share increase of 22% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $119 million or $1.17 per share, a 39% increase on a per share basis.", "Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 15.8% for the quarter and our book value per share was $32.70, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity carried at market value, book value per share grew 24% to $38.19. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $452 million, and life underwriting margins increased 13% to $126 million. Net life sales increased 9% to $88 million.", "At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $161 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $52 million. Net life sales increased 17% for the quarter to $39 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 5,104, up 26% from a year ago and up 17% during the quarter.", "The first quarter results at American Income far exceeded our expectations. The number of newly hired agents that produced business in the first quarter was up 52% from a year ago. The number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of agent retention, was up 76% in the quarter. Our middle management ranks grew by 12% in the quarter and are up 29% from a year ago. Every key factor indicates that 2012 is a stellar year for American Income.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $161 million and life underwriting margin grew 10% to $38 million. Net life sales were up 9% to $39 million. I am pleased with the results in direct response. While high gas prices and difficult economy continued to impact our response rates, through continuing innovation we've been able to grow our sales and maintain our margins.", "I would also remind everyone of the change we made in our direct response underwriting in mid-2011. While improving our margins, it resulted in a 6% reduction in our net sales due to more applications being rejected for health reasons. Life premium at Liberty National declined 2% to $72 million, while life underwriting margin was up 21% to $18 million.", "Net life sales declined 22% to $7 million, while net health sales grew 16% to $3 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,276, down 31% from a year ago and down 5% for the quarter. The underwriting margins at Liberty National had benefitted from the change in DAC accounting due to the significant reductions we have implemented in our non-deferrable acquisition cost over the last couple of years.", "I'm also very pleased with the progress being made in turning around our declines in producing agents and sales. In mid-February, the agent count at Liberty National hit its low point of 1,228. Since that time, we have seen consistent growth, and as of Monday, the producing agent count has grown to 1,321, which is up 7.5% in the past two months. I'm very optimistic that this agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales at Liberty National for the balance of this year.", "On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D declined 6% to $181 million, and health underwriting margin declined 10% to $40 million. Health net sales grew 5% to $15 million. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 50% to $74 million while the underwriting margin increased 54% to $8 million.", "Part D sales for the quarter jumped 235% to $25 million. The new low income subsidized enroll leads continue to exceed our prior estimates and we have raised our Part D revenue estimates for 2012 to $319 million versus $197 million for 2011.", "Administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, which were up 8% from a year ago, but in line with our expectations. Roughly half of this increase was caused by the elimination of the administrative fee which we were receiving on the United Investors business. The balance of the increase was due to increased cost in our Part D administration and conservation program.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman for his comments.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, capital and share repurchases. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of March 31, 2012. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets were $11.6 billion, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. There is no exposure to the European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt A mortgages.", "Of the fixed maturities $10.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $723 million compared to $758 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 6.5% compared to 7.2% a year ago and with the portfolio leverage of three times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 22%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus compared to BBB plus a year ago.", "We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio $873 million compared to $156 million a year ago. Regarding investment yield, in the first quarter we invested $232 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.76%, an average rating of A minus, and an average life of 30 years.", "The new money yield of 4.76% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 5.22% yield in the fourth quarter. For this reason we have lowered the GAAP discount rate used to calculate the reserves and DAC for policies issued in 2012 to 4.75%, graded to 6.5% over seven years.", "For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.47% compared to 6.52% in the previous quarter and 6.62% in the first quarter of 2011. The continued decline in the yield is due to the lower new money yields. As of March 31, the yield on the portfolio is 6.46%.", "Now turning to RBC we plan to maintain our capital at a level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio.", "Regarding share repurchases and parent company assets in the first quarter we spent $90 million to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares. So far in April we have used $36 million to buy another 750,000 shares. So for the full through today we have spent a $126 million of parent company cash to acquire 2.6 million shares. The available liquid assets at the parent company consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations as we've said before, free cash flow results from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on the debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "Assuming shareholders dividends at the current level, we expect to generate approximately $347 million of free cash flow for the entire year. This is less than the $350 million to $360 million projected in the previous call because we increased the dividend rate on Torchmark stock. Effective with the dividend paid in the second quarter, the dividend rate increased from $0.12 to $0.15 a share, which will result in 2012 dividends of approximately $56 million, $8 million more than they would have been.", "In spite of the dividend increase, the 2012 free cash flow plus the $74 million of cash on-hand at the beginning of the year will provide a total of $421 million of available cash for the full year. As of today, after deducting the $126 million of year-to-date share repurchases, the parent will have approximately $295 million available between now and the end of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds.", "Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, I would like to discuss the impact of the new accounting rules for DAC. On January 1st the Company adopted ASU 2010-26, which changed the rules regarding the deferral of acquisition cost. This standard changes the timing of GAAP profits to the extent that certain expenses deferred under the previous rules will no longer be deferred. However it does not affect our overall profitability, cash flows or statutory earnings. We adopted the new rule retrospectively, which means that DAC was written down to a level as if the new student had been in place in prior periods. The earnings impact of the new rule, is a combination of the reduction in expenses deferred on newly issued policies, somewhat offset by the reduced amortization of DAC resulting from the retroactive write-down.", "The financial statement impact of the new rules is consistent with the estimates that we discussed on the last call. First, compared to the comparable balances at March 31, 2011 the retroactive write-down was 16% of the DAC asset, resulting in a 10% reduction in GAAP equity, excluding the net unrealized gains on fixed maturities.", "In addition the earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were 1.2% or $0.016 per share lower than they would have been under the old rules and ROE excluding net unrealized gains was 15.8%, compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 under the old rules. All prior periods on the net operating summary and the balance sheet had been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of ASU 2010-26.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you, Gary. For 2012, we continue to expect our net operating income per share will be in a range of $5.10 and $5.40 per share. Before I open it up for questions, I would like to comment on the upcoming transition. I'm the fourth CEO in the 32 year history of Torchmark, and every succession has been seamless. I want to assure everyone that this succession will also go very smoothly. While I am stepping down as CEO on June 1, I will continue in an executive position as Chairman until June of 2013.", "I have the utmost confidence in both Larry and Gary, and have worked closely with both of them for over 25 years. I believe that either one of them would be an outstanding CEO on their own, but I also believe that together they will be better than either would be individually. I believe that the company is in the best shape it has been during my tenure as CEO and I know that Gary and Larry will only continue to make it better.", "Those are my comments for this morning. I will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we will first go to the side of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "I had a couple of questions. First, Mark, maybe you can discuss the rationale for the Co-CEO structure and then once you are not the Chairman, should we expect the CEO and Chairman role to be with one person or would it be split?", "And then on the business, just at Liberty National, the margins has actually been steadily improving, they were 24.5%, I think, this quarter, 22.9% first quarter last year. It seems like expense levels have declined, but what\u2019s your expectation for margins there?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Okay, well first on the Co-CEOs, and again you have to understand that Gary, Larry and I really have worked very closely together our entire careers. Even when I have been CEO, the three of us have really consulted on every significant decision made in this company and we always reach consensus and I do believe this is one of those cases that the two of them together because they do have very complementary skill sets, will be better than either one would be individually. So I feel very comfortable in this particular situation with these two individuals, it\u2019s the best thing for Torchmark and it makes the most sense in this situation.", "As far as Liberty National, yes, the margins have improved. I would expect they will stay at about the same level, at least for the balance of this year, Jimmy, somewhere in that 24% to 25% range. That\u2019s what we have assumed in our guidance.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then just comments on the Chairman and CEO?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well again, I am going to stay on at least through June 13. In fact I will intend to at least finish out my term, which will be April 14. Beyond that, it really hasn\u2019t been decided at this point. So that\u2019s something that we will continue to discuss.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the site of Christopher Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "I guess a question just for Gary. When you made the comment about lowering the discount rate to 4.75% and then grading it up to 6.5% over seven years, if you have kind of decided to keep it at 4.75%, what impact would that have as we think about the balance sheet or the income statement?", "Gary Coleman", "These slightly higher reserves than say if were I think at 5.75% for 2011 issues, but I think the more of the impact you would see on the financial statements, if we kept this over time right now, the weighted average discount rate is right around 5.6%. If we kept we used a 4.75% for succeeding years you would see that rate come down. But remember this just applies to 2012 issues, so it takes a while for that rate to come down, but if you continue at 4.75% for several years, at some point it would start moving from the 6.6% down toward the 4.75%.", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Chris, I'll also point out too that when we analyzed before, for example, American Income, if we lowered 100 basis points our interest rate assumptions and kept them 100 basis points lower throughout the life of the business, it would take a 2% to 3% rate adjustment to maintain our profitability.", "And again we did put through January 1 of this year, a 5% rate increase at American Income as well as most of the products at Globe Life. So while it will have a negative impact on our excess investment income that will also be offset by higher underwriting margins going forward as a result of the rate increases.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, that's where I was going to next. So at this point there is not a real need to adjust pricing any further. You kind of got what you needed you think currently in American Income?", "Gary Coleman", "No. Even if we had to go to 4.75% and maintain that, the rate adjustments we put through are more than adequate to maintain our profitability.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "In terms of the low investment grade. I guess the NAIC Class 3 and 4 buckets looked like they increased a bit sort of sequentially here. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, most of that occurred in the bank converts that we have and I believe as Moody's downgrade us by one notch, which would not have pushed them into the below investment grade category normally, but under the new rules that were passed last year regarding the hybrid type securities, that one notch downgrade under those new rules moved them into a class that goes into the SVO class for low investment grade bonds. It's a little bit of an unusual item but the quality of those bonds are not impaired in any measure. As a matter of fact, just on a normal basis, just on a standard grading, they are not below investment grade bonds, they just are as SVO classifies them.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then just lastly on the succession. Is there a mandatory retirement age in terms of being an executive within Torchmark? And then lastly, I didn't know if Gary or Larry could comment at all; it might be a bit premature but a little bit in terms of some strategy, vision if they think there will be any kind of material changes, whether it's the operating businesses or are we thinking about capital deployment?", "Mark McAndrew", "I'll take the first part of that, Gary, and then I'll let you. I think the only position in the Company that has a mandatory retirement age today is the CEO, which currently is set at 65, but that always through Board action could be adjusted going forward. But right now there is a mandatory retirement for the CEO at 65. Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "I don't look for any major changes in our business model. Larry and I have been involved in this Company for many years, as Mark said and we care firm believers in the model. I think there will be changes as our insurance markets change and also as the financial markets change we will adjust them as we have over the years. So, I think there'll be changes but I don't think you will see major changes in the fundamentals of how we operate the business.", "Larry Hutchison", "Like what Gary said, I agree with that. Our immediate focus is to have a seamless transition and to continue the type of growth we have experienced in 2011 and 2012.", "Operator", "We will go to the site of John Nadel with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "A couple of quick ones. I'm just curious about, I know that we just talked about discount rates and I'm just curious. I saw on the release that the discount rate on the net policy liability is in the excess investment income segment were actually up year-over-year. I guess I'm just curious, just given what rates have done, why up and not down?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well John, you have to remember that it is truly a discount rate. We are not setting rates or crediting interest to policy order fronts. This is simply the discount rate we used to calculate the reserves with DAC. And although we\u2019ve lowered the discount rate used last year, you got to remember that discount rate that we set each year applies only to policies issued in that year.", "So at 4.75% now in 2012 issues over 90% of our reserves are for policies issued prior to 2011, and during that period of time part we were using a discount rate somewhere, at times 6% and at times it\u2019s high as 7%, so between the 6% and 7%.", "So when you rate all those issue years together that\u2019s where you get to a little under 6% and over time, I think actually you will see that rate go up just slightly and it is going to level off and then as I mentioned earlier, if we continue at 4.75% in several years from now, you will see that trending down toward the 4.75%. Right now it is just the weighted average rate because of all of the many years of issue that we have out there is higher than what we are for the current year issues.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "And so to Mark\u2019s point earlier in response to Chris, pricing actions that you have taken, we should essentially see a shift in the profitability to more underwriting earnings and maybe excess investment income is a modest offset to that?", "Mark McAndrew", "Over the long term, John, that\u2019s true.", "Gary Coleman", "It\u2019s not the fact that we are not going to have a spread. We are still going to have spread over what we are earning on the assets over what that discount is on; it\u2019s just going to be little bit smaller than it has been in the past.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Understood. And then just another quick one on excess investment income. I noticed the invested assets dropped about $300 million at the end of 1Q versus the end of 2011, so quarter-over-quarter. I was sort of surprised to see a drop at that level. Could you explain what happened there and then maybe an outlook for the remainder of the year? I assume it grows from here.", "Gary Coleman", "", "I don\u2019t have a good answer for that at the moment, but our projection is that it will grow around the 4% range for the year.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "And then lastly I know Mark, you updated us on Medicare Part D on the revenues for the year. Obviously, things going better than you originally expected a few months ago. What's your outlook for sales there for the remainder of the year? Obviously, we're through the biggest part of the seasonal sales cycle.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well again, we picked up a large number on January 1, but what's really exceeding our expectations is the number of new enrollees that we're getting each month from either people just turning 65 or people just qualifying for the low income subsidy, and that number, we have been averaging about 6,800 a month, where initially we were only assuming 2,000 to 3,000 of those new people each month.", "So, we now expect to pick up over 75,000 during the course of the year and that will be pretty smooth through the year. So, if you look at the first quarter sales numbers we expect the ongoing sales to stay up at about that level.", "Gary Coleman", "John I might add, if you look at the assets with the picks at market value, one thing the unrealized gains or losses, as I mentioned earlier were at $873 million that were $964 million at the end of December 31. So, we had a $90 million drop just from that.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "", "Okay. I thought I was looking at it on the cost basis, but I'll follow up with you offline.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the site of Sarah DeWitt with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays", "", "Could you update us on your outlook for sales in American Income and Direct based on the better than expected first quarter results? And then also given your positive comments on Liberty, when do you think sales in that business could turn positive? ", "Mark McAndrew", "In our guidance there is probably still a little conservatism built in there. At American Income, we're assuming 14% to 15% growth in our sales this year, which again, we were at 17% in the first quarter. So, I think there is a good chance that we will beat what we've built in our guidance. At Globe, I think there also in our guidance we're just assuming mid to high single-digit growth in sales there. There is still some uncertainty there. So, I don't think we've being overly optimistic but as far as Liberty National, again I think we'll see sequential growth going forward but if I look back at last year, I feel confident that we'll have grown by the fourth quarter and sales year-over-year, I would expect the third quarter will be close to flat, but if I look a year from now, when we're comparing to the first quarter this year, I expect to see strong double-digit growth in sales a year from now at Liberty.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Okay great and then just on Globe, I think you had said partway through the first quarter, you were seeing introductory offers of about 30% year-over-year. Is that still the case?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well I think first quarter; it's running a little over 20%, the number of new enquiries coming in versus a year ago. So that is still going well, but again, that's why I mentioned we're starting with the 6% reduction just from the change in our underwriting. So, if I look at the 9% growth we had in first quarter, without that change in underwriting would have been more like 15% growth. So, that tampers it somewhat when we're comparing year-over-year. But I'm still very pleased with where it's at, and particularly if gas prices come down and the economy continues to improve, we may significantly beat that but at this point; we don't want to be overly optimistic in our projections.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Okay great and then just finally on the CEO transition, given your mandatory retirement age and I believe Gary and Larry are about the same age as you, should we consider this a long-term leadership structure?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, Gary is actually older than me, but Larry, you are what, 58?", "Larry Hutchison", "58.", "Mark McAndrew", "So, Gary is 59.", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Mark McAndrew", "So, for the last six, seven years before they hit the current mandatory retirement age. That mandatory retirement age can easily be extended through the Board action. So Gary, Larry, I\u2019ll let you put your two cents worth in.", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, certainly my concern is in the interim move, Gary and I committed to the company now that to be here at least for the next seven, eight years, Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "I agree to what Larry said. This is not an interim move; this is definitely something that we are committed to.", "Operator", "We will next go to the site of Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Mark, I heard a lot of better than expected trends, particularly on the sales and Liberty National margins and a view that's up and I didn\u2019t hear anything that\u2019s worse than you thought it was, yet you didn\u2019t change your guidance. Is it just too early in the year to talk about changing the range or was there something that sort of offsets all these positives you highlighted?", "Mark McAndrew", "Bob, the only thing, if I look at our earnings per share for the first quarter, I know we missed the street by a penny, but we are actually about a penny ahead of where we thought would be. We do have a number of things that are doing better than we anticipated, but the only thing, Bob, that offsets that is the price we paid on our share repurchase was more than \u2013 when we originally came out with that guidance, the stock was at $38. So that has tampered it somewhat, it is reasonably left at where it is. Again, I expect we will narrow that range as the year particularly next quarter, but right now the improved results offset the higher share price.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "And it sounds like the Liberty National margins are an ongoing plus, right, that we should factor in?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well I think where they are at today is I think we are going to try to maintain that. I wouldn\u2019t expect continued upward movement in those margins.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "But still year-over-year it\u2019s going to be helped in your three more quarters, and you weren\u2019t building that into your original?", "Mark McAndrew", "We were expecting better margins. When we did our guidance, we were expecting improved margins in the life business at Liberty.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "To this extent?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well not too far off. We knew as a result of the DAC write-down that the margins at Liberty would go up as a result of the cost savings and the restructuring that we have done at Liberty. They have moved more of those costs to variable costs. So, that was by design.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "I think you are following C.B's path. Didn\u2019t he retire a bit early, around this similar age?", "Mark McAndrew", "He retired at 60 and I became CEO and he stayed on as Chairman for a year when he turned 59. So, you are very astute Bob, it\u2019s basically exactly the same transition that we had with C.B.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney", "Are you going to follow his path and play Blackjack tournaments too?", "Mark McAndrew", "Probably not, but one never knows.", "Operator", "The next question comes from site of Ed Spehar with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Ed Spehar - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Mark, I was wondering, I missed if you said something on the Medicare supplement business. How should we think about that over the next few years, and to what extent should we think about it differently if for some reason we get in a Supreme Court ruling that voids the health reform?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "Well, I'll talk to it and I'll also let Larry address some of that. Right now, Ed, especially in the independent agency side of United American, we're starting to see some growth there, but again, it's not going to be a major contributor to our growth. I still hope that that continues to improve over the next two, three years. Larry, you want to address the\u2026?", "Larry Hutchison", "Ed, the health reform really didn't address Medicare Supplement, that was an exempted product. We're seeing lots of proposals right now in Washington that deals everything for benefit structures to loss ratios. Our information is there's no immediate change that restricts the Medicare systems. Probably the earliest will be 2014. There is a lot of uncertainty, we don't know which parties are going to be control with, we don't know who is going to really shape future changes of Medicare. We know there are going to be changes, of all depths of those changes, and we have played in that market. I can just say at this time, it's a little early to say exactly where Medicare will be in 2014, 2015, and 2016.", "Ed Spehar - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Mark, hopefully now you'll have more opportunities to drive your car a quarter mile at the time.", "", "Operator", "The next question comes from the site of Paul Sarran with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "I wanted to ask first about the American Income agent growth. And I guess my question is how many new agents can you handle per middle management? The reason I ask is because you seem to be adding in a lot new agents at a lot faster rate than you're growing the middle management ranks. I'm wondering if that becomes a limiting factor at some point.", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, I don't see it as a limiting factor. Yes, the number of new hires was up over 50% in the first quarter versus our middle management ranks were up 29%, but one of the things that we were very successful in doing was, the number of middle management people that we have that hired and trained a new person increased significantly from a year ago. We did in the middle of last year put out a new incentive program to try to get more of our middle management involved in the recruiting and training and that appears to have been very successful. But not only did we increased the number of middle managers by 29%; we also increased the percentage of those that actually recruited and trained someone.", "So, can we maintain 50%, 60% growth? That's going to be difficult. But can we continue to grow our middle management ranks by 30%, 40% a year? Yes, we can. I don't see it as a real limiting factor. Actually, the more new people that we're hiring and bringing on, those people \u2013 as our agent base gets larger, the candidates that move into middle management becomes larger.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. You got a question about Liberty margins. I wanted to ask you about American Income, where margins improved somewhere around 100 to 200 basis points year-over-year, and it looks like it was mainly driven by lower expenses. How sustainable is that and is there any room to push expenses lower or is that about as large you can get it?", "Mark McAndrew", "Obviously, as we continue to grow, we do have some fixed expenses there such as management salaries and travel that will give us some improvement in our expense margins, but again at American income, the vast majority of our cost there are variable cost, they are commissions and those will grow as sales grows. So, I don't anticipate any major improvement in the margins there, although we did put through again 5% rate increase in the beginning of this year which over time will add a little bit to the underwriting margin, but we don\u2019t anticipate it really improving from where it is but we expect to be able to maintain where it is at.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "At Global you talked about 20% higher new increase and then if we offset that by the 6% impact from the new underwriting standards, that still would seem to suggest mid-teen sales growth, which is higher than what you're guiding to, so you mentioned uncertainty what\u2019s causing you to getting that.", "Mark McAndrew", "You need to understand the inquiries is from our Insert Media segment, which is little over half of our total sales. The other half come from our direct mail program, it's been relatively flat in comparison. So the 22% does not pertain to all of the direct response business. So that\u2019s what part of the reason why I get back to mid-to-high single digits in growth.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "So, you said responses at the direct mail were pretty flat year-over-year?", "Mark McAndrew", "Right now our direct response sales a relatively pretty flat from a year ago.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Is that also impacted by the new underwriting?", "Mark McAndrew", "Yes it would be.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "And then last question, you have a $53 million at the holding company, do you expect to drive down any further or is $50 million kind of where you think you will keep a buffer for the rest of the year?", "Mark McAndrew", "", "I still anticipate maintaining somewhere in that $50 million. Gary, do you have any...?", "Gary Coleman", "No, I think we will be right around $50 million.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the site of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Gary, just to make sure that I am clear here, you are planning as of right now to spend the $295 million that you detailed before 21 less the $126 million spend so far?", "Gary Coleman", "That was a variable and I am sure we will spend most of that.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay and then lot of questions has been asked, but I do want to go back to the ACA question for Larry. I believe Larry that there is going to be or supposedly whether it happens or not remains to be seen, but a lot of money going away from the Part C program, is that correct?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think that\u2019s correct, but again, all this is proposed at this point. I think we are going to have a gridlock in Congress through the remainder of the year, but I think next year you will see that those proposals actually take shape and better able to predict exactly what the Medicare system is going to look like. I have seen everything from Class A and B together to changes to see and it's just, as we make proposals, it's hard to sort out and say exactly what the Medicare system looks like. We know it's going to change a little depth of those changes.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Is there anything in the I haven't see it, but just to make it clear, is there anything in ACA to effect Part D?", "Larry Hutchison", "I haven't seen anything with respect to Part D, really the proposals are dealt with potentially Medicare systems.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the site of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead your line is open.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "You had previously discussed some efforts to try to improve persistency in your policy retention. Did you had a lot of success on that front and is there more we might anticipate?", "Mark McAndrew", "It's actually going very well. I'm pleased with the results there. In the first quarter, we ran a little bit ahead of our goal. Our new initiatives on conservation, we conserved a little over $7.4 million of premium versus our target of $7.1 million. We still project that we'll conserve something over $31 million of life premium this year through our new conservation efforts. So, very pleased with where it's at and it's actually running about 4% of where we thought it would be.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "How about the Medicare Part D margins, with good growth in policies? Is the mix similar? How should we think about profitability then going forward?", "Mark McAndrew", "Again, even with the low income subsidize and release, the product that we're selling there has the same underwriting margins as the product we were selling to individuals. So, we expect the current margin as a percentage of premiums to basically maintain that margin going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the site of Vincent Lowry with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Vincent Lowry - Morningstar", "Most of my questions have been answered, the discount grade related to business and a way of new business. So, I just want to go back and talk a little bit about the direct response. I understand that, Mark you indicated there are more rejections to the applications due to the new underwriting standard, but do you see any change in demographic composition or how it's used in the markets that you serve in general?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well, no. I haven't really seen a lot of change in the demographics. Again, in our insert media side, our demographics are a little lower income and they are in the direct mail side. That's why it tends to have been more impacted by the economy. So, there is some pressure, but we haven't seen anything that's going to change in our demographics.", "Vincent Lowry - Morningstar", "So, you basically just string it from the underwriting stand as to sort of improve the mortality expense?", "Mark McAndrew", "Absolutely, yes. Again, the trick in our direct response is it has to be something that's low cost and efficient because of the large numbers we're dealing with, and utilizing that prescription drug records. It did point out that about 6% of the policies that we had been issuing were really people that were uninsurable. So, it definitely is improving our mortality and improving our margins. We're making more profit but we're issuing less business.", "Vincent Lowry \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. Can you kind of comment on the current rejection rate versus the historical one in this direct response business?", "Mark McAndrew", "It varies by product and by market. I don't I have those, it's something we could provide for you, but I don't have those in front of me.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the site of Jeff Schuman with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "I want to talk first a little bit more about Part D. The premium increase there this year is still large that actually changes the growth there of the entire Company, which is certainly great for 2012. You talked a little bit about 2013 last quarter, but I was wondering if you could just kind of update your thoughts on whether Part D is likely to go up, down or sideways next year?", "Mark McAndrew", "In fact we are doing our pricing right now for I think, by the 1st of June we have to have our pricing for 2013. Dealing with our pharmacy benefits manager, we think we've come up with some ideas to continue to have a positive impact on our pricing. It\u2019s impossible to project at this point of what 2013 is going to look like, but right now we are optimistic that we\u2019ll not only maintain, but hopefully see additional growth in 2013 from Part D.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "And in terms of the share that you have gained this year, did it come primarily at the expense of a couple of companies who could directly or did it come very broadly from the entire market?", "Mark McAndrew", "Well I\u2019m not sure that I know, I don\u2019t know exactly where those came from, but again it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll get back to you on.", "Jeff Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay and then with regard to the CEO transition, Mark you talked about Gary and Larry having some complementary skills, and I\u2019m just wondering if they could share with us any preliminary thoughts about how they might organize themselves, for example, all of the lines and functions are going to report to both of them simultaneously or there will be some division to focus on how they are thinking about that.", "Mark McAndrew", "Gary and Larry, I\u2019ll let you respond to that.", "Larry Hutchison", "Just a division of focus, on a day-to-day basis. I\u2019ll be in-charge of the TMK Marketing, the CEOs report to me. I\u2019ll continue with the legal compliance, the HR functions. Gary, why don\u2019t you speak to your day-to-day reporting?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Jeff, I will continue with the investment\u2019s financial reporting, investor relations and internal, all of those areas, but in addition to that, the actuarial area will report to me and also the administrative area, but I would like to in size we are doing that from the David's standpoint, helping the operations, but all material decisions will be made jointly by Larry and me.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will go next to the site of Sam Hoffman with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Sam Hoffman - Nomura", "I want to ask a question about the initiatives underway at Liberty National. Can you talk about the leading indicators that you are seeing that indicate to you whether or not are those initiatives going to work and then in the worst case, if they don\u2019t work, can you just go back to the $7 million of sales each quarter or there kind of downside case because you are undergoing an organizational restructuring that could unravel further?", "Mark McAndrew", "Sam, I will address it. I feel very confident that Liberty National is going through a turnaround and I am very confident that the initiatives will work. Again, we Steve to Charles, we moved him from American Income as well as Roger Smith as CEO, I think are doing an outstanding job. I think the attitudes at Liberty are better than they have been in quite some time. As far as the early indicators, our recruiting is growing and obviously, the agent count in the last eight to nine weeks has consistently grown. So, I don\u2019t have a contingency plan because I don\u2019t feel like I need one. I feel strongly that Liberty is on the right track moving forward and I think over the next couple of quarters it will be apparent to everyone.", "Sam Hoffman - Nomura", "And then one other follow-up question. You\u2019ve obviously had an enormously successful run at Torchmark, outperforming every other company in the industry by a wide margin, and now as a large shareholder of the Company stock, do you intend to hold your stock in the Company through your retirement in 2013 and 2014 as well as your options. I'm not sure how the program works. Maybe you could comment a bit upon that, and then certainly your intentions to hold your stock through the turnaround of Liberty National and the continued growth of the other businesses which you're doing so well?", "Mark McAndrew", "I definitely intend to hold my stock, not just through the transition, but I intend to hold it, and definitely I think our stock is still undervalued by historic standards. I think our prospects for growth again I think are the best they've been in my 10 years as CEO. You may see, as far as options and in fact \u2013 because the change in the accounting rules on options, we can no longer do reload that we used to do in the past, but now every office here has options that expire each year. Even if we take the equity from those options and convert it into outright shares, it will still show up as Company stock. So, you may see some of that. In fact, you will see some of that because everyone has options that expire each year, but that does not mean that we're selling shares. In fact, typically most people are converting those to outright ownership shares.", "Sam Hoffman - Nomura", "Great and then the program that you have at this point, it doesn't like require you to exercise all of your options and sell them upon your retirement, you can basically rest and whatever you like.", "", "Mark McAndrew", "That's one of the nice things. At age 60, I have at least five years, Larry?", "Larry Hutchison", "That's correct.", "Mark McAndrew", "So on all the options, I have at least five years before I have to exercise those.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions in queue, so I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "Thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments, and we hope you have a great day. See you next quarter.", "Operator", "", "That does conclude your teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations of Torchmark Corporation. Please go ahead.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman, and Larry Hutchison, our Co-CEOs. Mark McAndrew, our Executive Chairman. Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2011 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the second quarter was $127 million, or $1.30 per share, a per share increase of 19% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $129 million or $1.32 per share, a 4% increase on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized costs, our return on equity was 15.8%, and our book value was $33.26, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share grew 29% to $41.38.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $451 million, and life underwriting margins increased 7% to $124 million. Net life sales increased 4% to $89 million. So far in July, our sales were ahead of expectations, and our guidance for 2012 remains unchanged.", "On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D declined 5% to $177 million, and health underwriting margins declined 2% to $40 million. Health sales were $13 million, the same as the year ago quarter.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the insurance operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $164 million, and life underwriting margin was also up 12% to $54 million. Net life sales increased 10% for the quarter to $40 million. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,318, up 23% from a year ago and up 4% during the quarter. ", "We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and we are excited about the company's future prospects. We are seeing growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieve our top bonus level, which is our best indicator of the agent retention. The first top bonus owners were up 60% in the second quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 21% in the second quarter. We expect sales growth for remainder of the year to range from 12% to 15%.", "Our Direct Response operation, Global Life, life premiums were up 5% to $58 million and life underwriting margin declined 1% to $35 million. The decline in margin was due to unusual claim fluctuations and we expect that the loss ratios will return to previous levels for the remainder of the year. Net life sales were up 4% to $38 million. We are also pleased with the results in Direct Response, despite a difficult economy, we have been able to grow our sales.", "We would also remind everyone of the change we initiated in our Direct Response underwriting in mid-2011. On improving our margins resulted in a reduction of our net sales due to more applications been rejected for health reasons, set sales growth through the remainder of the year to be around mid-single digit range.", "Liberty National segment declined 2% to $71 million. Our life underwriting was up 21% to $18 million. Net life sales declined 18% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 12% to $4 million. However, health sales increased 9% in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter.", "The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,355, down 24% from a year ago, but up 6% for the quarter. We are very pleased with the progress we have made in turning around our declines and producing agents and sales.", "We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward, which will result in improved sales of Liberty National for the balance of the year. Premium revenue from Part D grew 60% to $78 million and the underwriting margin increased 47% to $8 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 915% to $22 million due to the increase in low income subsidized enrollees for 2012.", "I will now turn the call back over to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", " ", "To complete, insurance operations administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, 1% less than a year ago quarter and in line with our expectations.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2012. As indicated on the schedule, invested assets were $11.6 million, including $11.1 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.", "There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. Of the fixed maturities, $10.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $764 million, compared to $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below our investment grade bonds of fixed maturities of 6.9%, compared to 6.7% a year ago.", "With a portfolio of leverage of three times, the percentage of big bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 24%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB+, just slightly the under the A- of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.2 billion compared to $873 million in the first quarter, and $156 million a year ago.", "Now, regarding investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $197 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective of 4.49% and averaging rating of BBB plus at an average life of 27 years.", "For the year, we have invested $430 million at an average rating of A-. The new money yield of 4.49% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011, and the 4.76% yield in the first quarter of this year.", "For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 6.43%, compared to 6.47% in the previous quarter and 6.6% in the second quarter 2011. The decline in yield is due to the lower new money rates. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.42%.", "On July 5, the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the 2013 changes to the capital rules for banks, were issued. Subsequently we were notified that 301 million of our $708 million of bank hybrid trust preferred securities will be called in July and August. These securities have an average yield rate at 7.18%, and assuming the call proceeds are re-invested at 4.25%, the loss to annual income will be $9 million pre-tax, or $6 million after-tax. For 2012, the loss to income will be approximately $3 million after-tax and the portfolio yield will be reduced by about 8 basis points. This amount was accounted for in our guidance.", "The remaining bank hybrids, we anticipate that another $300 million could be called. We don't know whether any of them will be called in the last half of 2012, but I expect the most of them to be called by end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35%, and assuming the same 4.25% investment rate, the loss to renewal income if all of those securities are called, it will be a similar $6 million after-tax.", "On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower for longer rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest grades continues to be the impact on earnings, not on the balance sheet.", "We maintain our underwriting margins, we write a new business premium rates on the majority of American Income's life products and the Direct Response juvenile products by 5% at January 1 of this year. These increases provided additional margin to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies and we did so without having a detrimental impact on sales.", "However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years, and that assumes recall of the $600 million of hybrid preferreds.", "Last fall, we performed a stress test to determine the impact on the portfolio yield of investing all new money in at 4.75% over the next five years. Under that scenario, we determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016, would be between 5.95% and 6.10%. We have rerun the model this time using a new money rate of 4.25% and determined that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be around 5.75% to 5.85%.", "At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. Even though we don't believe our new money rate will be as low as 4.25% for the next five years, should that happen, we would still generate substantial excess investment income.", "As I mentioned, an extended lower interest rate environment impact to income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off the (Inaudible) stood up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.", "In addition, we'll not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share purchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In second quarter, we spent $184 million to buy 3.9 million Torchmark shares at an average of $47.42.", "Going into the second quarter, we had anticipated spending price $90 million, which we did to acquire 1.9 million shares at an average cost of $48.54 per share. However due to favorable market conditions, we made the decision to acquire an additional 2 million shares during the quarter.", "These additional shares were acquired for total cost of $94 million, an average of $46.39 per share this was less than a $48.54 per share paid to purchase the initial 1.9 million. For the full year through June 30, we had spent 274 million of parent company cash to acquire $5.8 million shares at an average price of $47.53.", "The available liquid assets as a parent consist of assets on hand and they and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.", "We expect to generate approximately $350 million of free cash for the entire year. Thus, the total liquid assets available for all of 2012 will be around $424 million. During the first six months of the year, we generated about $163 million of free cash flow but spent $274 million tor Torchmark share repurchases, purchasing 5.8 million Torchmark shares. The repurchases were funded by $179 million from the cash on hand and $95 million from the issuance of additional commercial paper.", "As a result of this activity, the parent ended the second quarter with $58 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets, plus $163 million of free cash flow, less $179 million used for share repurchases.", "Going forward, along with the $58 million on hand at the end of the second quarter, we should generate approximately $184 million of free cash flow in the next two quarters giving us $242 million of total cash available for the remainder of the year. $95 million of this cash will be used to reduce our commercial paper to its normal level, leaving us with approximately $147 million of liquid assets available between now and the end of the year.", "It should be noted that we have already reduced the commercial paper outstanding by approximately 9o million since June 30. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain a minimum of $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.", "Now regarding the capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio was lower than some peer companies, but it's sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relative lower risk of our policy liabilities and our current ratings.", "At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of the amount required for the targeted 325% ratio. Those were my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2012, we expect our net operating income per share to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.26 per share. Net investment income for the year will be lower than previously expected due to hybrids being called and the lower new money yields.", "Those were our comments for this morning. We will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Vincent Lu with Morningstar.", "Vincent Lu - Morningstar", "Just a question about the investment portfolio. If I understand the credit rating has been bit one notch to triple B+. How much was that, would you characterize natural credit migration, and how much was that, as a constant effort to increase the allocation to below investment grade securities.", "Frank Svoboda", "First of all we are not constantly increasing the below investment grade securities. Increase quarter was due to down grade, but we are not constantly moving towards lower credit rating either. The BBB+, rounded adjusted is under A-. So it's only a slight difference from where we were in the last several quarters. So it really hasn't changed that much.", "Vincent Lu - Morningstar", "Then, a separate question about the agency account at Liberty. Is that really a target agency account there to turn things around and start having the sale growth again?", "Frank Svoboda", "I don't know what you mean by target agency account.", "Vincent Lu - Morningstar", "I mean it's been decreasing 6% from last year, but is there a target number that you are looking at or?", "Frank Svoboda", "We are looking the investment to grow this quarter. I am confident that system and the processes have been changed at Liberty National. We will continue to see this sequential growth through the end of this year and into next year, and I expect growth to pick 6%. It's only single digit, but it's going to be 6%, 7%, 8% of the third and the fourth quarter of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jeff Schuman with KBW.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the arithmetic around the calls on the trust preferred. There are different ways to look at the arithmetic on the guidance change, but if we look at the movement in the mid-point, I guess, it would suggest the mid-point maybe has moved by $0.08.", "I think when you kind of walked us through the math on swapping of the coupons on the $300 million that has been called so far. You got to $3 million after-tax impact for the remainder of the calendar year which is about $0.03, so trying to bridge a little between that amount and what seems to be maybe by some interpretation of bigger move in the guidance.", "Is there another piece here, which is that you may suffer a period, where the funds are simply not deployed? We need to factor that in, or how should we think about it?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Jeff. That's definitely a point. We had $180 million of short-term investments at the end of the quarter and we are going to be adding another $300 million very shortly. It does take a while to get that money reinvested.", "To answer your question as far as the additional, I outlined the additional $0.03 comes from the fact that we are going to be slightly delayed in getting that money reinvested, but also all new money coming in beside the call, when we invested at a lower rate than we had projected previously.", " ", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Okay, so the rest of it is just the general movement rates of further down. Okay. I'm sorry. You broke up a little bit when you gave the earlier. What is the total upsize of the bank trust preferred portfolio.", "Frank Svoboda", "As of June 30, we have $708 million bank hybrids.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Bank hybrids, 708? Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "Of that $300 has already been called for July and August. The remaining $408 million, there's a $107 million that are either not callable or they may co-calls and we're not expecting those to be called. That leaves another $301 million that could be called, and based on where their rates are, we feel they probably will be called.", "As we talked about this in previous analyst calls the reason these bonds are being called is there is a provision in those bond that they can be called if there is a change in the capital rules, and they lose their capital status. Of course under Dodd-Frank those rules are going to be changed and those rules will be effective in 2013. So all along, we felt that the $600 million source of bond would probably be called and that they would be called in 2013.", "Earlier in the year, some banks were looking at the fact whenever the rules are published, which is expected in 2012, but that would be the triggering event not the actual implementation of the rules in 2013, and that's what happened here with these $300 million.", "Early in the year, some banks were looking at the fact, whenever the rules are published, which is expected to be in 2012, then that would be the true ring of the bell, not the actual implementation of the rules in 2013. That\u2019s what has happened here, the $300 million, those banks are considering a triggering event happening when those rules are or at least the notice of the rule making was issued in July. So we don't know is that the other $300 million are potential cause. We don't know whether the banks will determine 2012 as a trigger year or whether later 2013. We'll just have to wait and see what they do.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Okay. That's helpful. Just one other area quickly if I may. Part D, looks like it's checking below the 12% margin I think you had hoped to achieve. Is it too early to conclude they maybe are just not going to hit pricing assumptions, or how should we think about that?", "Frank Svoboda", "I think it's a little too early to conclude what their pricing margin is going to be. If you look year to-date, where we were this year and where we were last year.", "Jeff Schuman - KBW", "Okay, then you did see a strong uptick in the second half. Is there some normal seasonality or some reason that we can maybe think that that's likely to recur?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Jeff. There's some seasonality there and latter part of the year, we got probably (Inaudible) rebates from the government. The rebates were greater than we expected last year in the second half of the year, and that helped to elevate that margin.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "I think last quarter you guys talked a about if you made adjustments in the investment portfolio, down 100 basis points or so, you could offset that on the margin side by raising premiums just 2% to 3%, and you talked about the 5% rate increase, you did effective January 1. Are there any discussions around additional pricing changes you guys are looking to implement?", "Larry Hutchison", "No, I wouldn't expect to increase the rates again, because of lower interest rates. We really only needed to raise the rates about 2%. We went ahead and raised them 5%, but knowing that maybe rates might go down a little more. So I think, even rates have declined, I think the 5% that we implemented this year still covers that.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then for Frank. You made the comment about being opportunistic on buybacks given the share price by using the CP. If shares did get back to that level, is that another lever you guys would be willing to pull again or was that just sort of a one-time opportunity?", "Frank Svoboda", "Chris, we really look at that as being more of a one-time opportunity within the year to accelerate some of the purchases really from the third quarter back in the second quarter. We have really had a philosophy of not wanting to borrow to fund the buyback program and wanted to use our existing free cash flows for those buybacks, and I see that will continue to do that.", "Mark McAndrew", "Chris, I would add it depends on price. If the price go down to a very low level where we really we couldn\u2019t pass up the buying, we could borrow again under a commercial paper and then pay it back with free cash flow from next year.", "The good thing about Torchmark is we got the $350 million of free cash this year. Well, it will be at least around $350 million again next year and year after that. So we could prefund using expected free cash flow from next year. However, I agree with Frank. I don't anticipate us doing that unless there is a significant reduction in the share price.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, then lastly your competitor this morning talked about the rating agencies forcing them to hold a higher level of capital RBC and they said that wasn't due to the liability structure, their product mix, but because of the long durations of their investment portfolio, and I guess given that your investment portfolio has a longer duration than some of your peers, have you been similar messages from the rating agency.", "Frank Svoboda", "No, we haven't, and one reason maybe is, yes, our portfolio is long, but our liabilities are long too. We are matched. These other companies, there may be a mismatch in liability that could reaction by the rating agencies, but we haven't heard anything like that.", "Operator", "Next, we'll take a question from Sarah DeWitt with Barclays.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays", "I was wondering if you could elaborate on what drove the slowdown in sales growth in American Income and Direct, particularly given that the agent count of the American Income continues to grow at a pretty fast pace.", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, it wasn\u2019t running at (Inaudible) drove the slowdown, august and June. June sales were a little wire than expected . When we look at July, we are back and excess of the 15% for sales in July, such cases have one month aberration. Again, our guidance for the year, we think American Income will be in a 12% to 15% range.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Then on liberty national, I think previously you had said you expect sales growth to be positive by year end there. Is that still the case?", "Larry Hutchison", "That's still the case. We continue to see growth in the agents, but that's just sequential growth of the agents by the fourth quarter because of the quarter year-over-year growth.", "Operator", "Next is Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Just as a quick one on the preferred issues. Can you disclose if there was a larger banks that were earlier to prepay these preferreds and if we could expect maybe the smaller ones to be slower to catch up?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. Randy. I am just looking at our last year.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Or even better, specifically, who pre-paid and who didn't.", "Larry Hutchison", "It was the bigger banks. Bank of America, JPMorgan, they were almost half of the call, and I am just looking at list of who is likely to be called and they are the smaller banks.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay, that's what we thought and will help us monitor I guess the pick up on what Sarah was just asking on AIA. Larry, did you say 12% to 15% for AIA as the goal? Okay. I guess just kind of looking for a little more color. Maybe this kind of is a question that spans both AIA and Liberty, but understand the aging counts, understand the sales manager account being higher, and obviously that's probably giving you some confidence in the forward look on sales, but there has been training initiatives. I think there has been new laptop presentations and other initiatives I would be curious kind of updates how those other initiatives might be playing into this and helping your thinking on the sales guidance.", "Larry Hutchison", "Sure. There's not one initiative. There's a number of initiatives. One is the laptop presentation, and we are introducing that by year end. That will be whether international life insurance company. It takes some time at Liberty National to put the team in place, and as you (Inaudible) it takes some time to spread that throughout the field.", "At American Income would still have a number of initiatives. We are seeing better training. We're producing better data to manage the training with and some of the data, again, comes from the laptop presentation at American Income. That\u2019s why we introduced it there. It's really the data and we can track them with the agents themselves, what their performance is in terms of number of presentations, the closing rates, all of it helps retain agents.", "That's reflected in those numbers, where we're seeing more of the first time agents chip bonus, we are seeing middle management grow. As some management grows, they will do better training, because there will be more middle mangers that can train those new agents. So it's not one initiative and it\u2019s more than one initiative.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Yes. That's great color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next we will turn to Paul Sarran, Evercore Partners.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "I just wanted to follow-up first on American Income, where it's for the last year and a half or so agent count growth has exceeded sales growth, and especially large margin over the last few quarters.", "Is this is a trend that you think should reverse going forward? In other words, should we see productivity start to pick back up towards historical levels as new agents mature?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, correct, and besides, new agents, the middle managers are more attracted in terms of their training and closing rates of sales. So I think we are little bit level in terms of our productivity. We expect that to pick-up some more agents as they mature.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. If you kind of adjust for the fact that you have more new agents now thanks to the growth. Is there anything else that's impacting productivity negatively?", "Larry Hutchison", "Not negatively. It's just as you may have new agents. There's a little bit of a catch-up period as you have search for new agents and I think it can be closer to the 15% growth at the end of the year than the 12%. It's a quarterly review. It's not month to month, but we're seeing improvements in those numbers.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay, turning to Direct Response. What is it that gives you confidence that the lower margins this quarter were a one-time claims fluctuation.", "Larry Hutchison", "Paul, one thing, looking at margin, we were just a little over 22%, and 23.5% for the quarter to prior year. 24% from prior quarter, there's 23.5%. Still, we are not talking about big change, but what we did see is clients are little bit lower in the first quarter and I think we called up in the second quarter and we think for the that they will be right around the 45% to 46% level they are now.", "We had little bit higher amortization in the quarter and that's kind of seasonal thing. We think that if you really look at the years, the percentages as opposed to this quarter. I think that's what you're going to see for the full year.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. The lower claims in the first quarter and higher in the second? Do you think any of that was reporting timing or changes in IBNR, or you think it's random kind of fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.", "Frank Svoboda", "No, I think it was a little bit of timing and it doesn't take much of the change on timing to affect the total for a quarter. For the six months though, they are about where we expected.", "Paul Sarran - Evercore Partners", "Okay. Then Direct Response sales, I was a little surprised to see sales fall sequential and I know there is some seasonality to it, but you also expanded circulation pretty dramatically in the second half of last year. I think the response is not coming in as much as you would have expected or is this kind of in line?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "That's kind of in line and we expect the responses for the year to be about what they were in last year. We just had a big surge in the third and fourth quarter that takes time for those sales to go up.", "Operator", "", "Mark Hughes with SunTrust has our next question.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "Thank you very much. On the Direct Response business, are there any campaigns coming up that might lead to any increase or tougher comps perhaps in sales activity?", "Larry Hutchison", "There has always been campaigns at Global Life and (Inaudible) the Global Life constantly they are testing new methods of distribution or (Inaudible) growth in our electronic, media and we want the sales to go up.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Right, so we would expect just consistency.", "Larry Hutchison", "I expect the same consistency and since the Global does they continue test and with single upward ticks over time I would expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Mr. Bhullar, your line is open.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Just had a question on the timing of share buybacks for the second half. The stock is obviously down, but should we expect the year to be buying back stock on an even basis in the third and fourth quarter, or if it declines more, would be you be opportunistic and do more of the buybacks in the third quarter.", "Then, secondly, I had a question on the agent count of Liberty National. Obviously, it's recovered nicely since February. Anything that would suggest that their company might short-lived, or do you expect the agent count to continue to improve?", "Larry Hutchison", "I will take the second of that first. I don't think Liberty National is going to be instantaneous, rather slow deliberate growth. You'll see sequential growth each quarter at Liberty National. As you may take some time to have those systems in place, but we're improving the training, the lead programs, the recruiting, well all those initiatives start at the same time. Obviously with the sequential growth of agency, you are seeing those get some traction.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "You must see high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, then I'll see the stronger growth next year as those mature and for the throughout the first of the year through 2013.", "Mark McAndrew", "Jimmy as far as the share repurchases, as Frank mentioned came in your expecting this (Inaudible) on share purchases, and I think that as of today I kind of think that's where we'll end up, so that means for the second half of the year you are talking about $90 million of share repurchase. We haven't determined what, but we think the timing of that should be, but you are right. If there's an opportunistic chance to get a better yield on the purchase, we would accelerate it, but at this point we don't expect spending more than the $360 million.", "Operator", "Next is, John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Gary, you mentioned 4.25% new money yield for the updated sensitivity analysis. I am just wondering is that around the level that might be consistent with where you are currently investing new money given the more recent drop in rates. I know you are just under 4.5% for the full quarter.", "Gary Coleman", "", "You are right. We're right about 1.5 and rates have dropped, and that's right around where we are investing now, maybe a little bit higher, but we assume fully quarter in our guidance and that's probably where we are going to be.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "", "Yes, I understand. Second one is just how should we think about the outlook for Part D sales from here? Obviously, there has been some great momentum with the new product. I am just wondering how much longer you think that runway will last?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Well, long-term, John, it's hard to address. The short-term, we submitted our pricing in June this year, and we expect CMS will publish the 2013 benchmark premiums in August. When we are checking our existing regions, and partially has a few more regions from that it's published.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay, then just can you update us on the progress that you've been making on the premium retention program?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Yes, or projections of this year that without the conservation program, we would be lapsing around $250 million for the annual premiums, annualized. Our estimate now is that for this year, we will conserve around $31 million of that that would normally have lapsed, but of course so that's an annualized amount. The actual premium collected for year from that saving that $31 million will be around $15 million. It's a little bit higher than what we projected coming into the year.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "How do you think about that for next year? I know whether it was a quarter or two ago, when you originally started talking about this program, you expected to broaden it to some of the additional channels. I am wondering what you are thinking about in terms of the savings you might be able to garner looking out to 2013.", "Gary Coleman", "", "Well, I don't have a projection for 2013, but you are right. We have extended it out. At first it was primarily the American Income. American Income is about 40% of it, but there's another 45% of it now that is in Direct Response and Liberty makes up the difference. Again, I don't have a projection for next year, but I am sure it's going to be higher, because we are improving as we go along.", "Larry Hutchison", "(Inaudible) we need to hire within that section and train in order to expand those efforts and so it can grow next year we'll decide the percentage calculated just.", "John Nadel - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Then I am sorry I want just last one. Can you just walk us through why the discount rate on the policy liability has increased? I know it was 5.65% in the second quarter. That' s up from 5.60% being last quarter and 5.55% a year ago. It also seems so counter intuitive with rates falling? Can you just remind us?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Yes, John, it's all related to the fact that our import log of business is made up of many years of issues, but really few years we have reduced the discount rate, but that's a discount rate on policies issued in the year.", "Going back several years ago, our discount rate was more into 6.5% to 7% range. Right now, a higher percentage of the block of business is at the 6% or 7% rate. As time goes by, though they'll decline end and the policies issues at the lower rates will become a bigger part of the (Inaudible) and we'll have a lower discount rate.", "What it looks like is, is that discount rate will continue to increase slightly over the next two to three years, and it\u2019s really at a point versus around 5.75%, we think it will start declining from that point. If it\u2019s at where they are today, so it will rise for a little bit and then it will start declining.", "Operator", "Next is Stephen Schwartz, Raymond James & Associates", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "Good morning, everybody. John just asked a question. I want to ask on retention, so just a quick one. The $300 million of hybrids that have not been called that are callable. That's not in this year's guidance, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "Let's say they have to give us at least 30 days. Now it is on the call, and let's say they're called at. The actually money goes out on September 30, and I kind of think that's the worst case. You are talking about $0.02. We did include the $0.02 in the low end, but it may be less that, and let's say we don\u2019t really know how many of them will be called in 2012.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay, but it make sense if it's going to be called, it's going to be called by (h)1231, because otherwise it's in the capital earned. It's not in the capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Well as the legal though is whether they can call all the provisions are a slightly different, and it is not clear cut. The banks that have called then they new position that's announcement it rules is triggering about from there may think the GSA has implementation of the rules that won't be in 2013, before there is a triggering of that, so it is a legal question that they are probably looking at, again we don't know how they'll look at it, so we don't where recalled in '12 or not.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "That's all I had left over.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Ed Forun, Nomura.", "Ed Forun - Nomura ", "Good morning. I was hoping you could quantify how much capital will be freed up as the $600 million in preferreds are called and what the use should be of that capital?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Ed. It looks like a portion of the known calls that we have, there's a portion of that that in fact would be NAIC category three and four, so we will get some capital relief out of that. Right now it would appear that it's maybe by $12 million of statutory capital that would be freed up.", "If in fact, the other $300 million of the bank hybrids are in fact called before the end of the year that an additional roughly $30 million statutory capital would be freed up as well, so remember that is sitting in the statutory and the insurance companies, so just continuing upon what the other course of events over the remainder of the year.", "It's whether now we can end up getting in that money out before the end of the year or 2013, or if we need to leave it in there to meet our RBC levels.", "Gary Coleman", "Ed, I might add that just looking at the (inaudible) portfolio the as the $300 million debt have been called 85 million are below investment grades. So our below investment grade bonds will declined $85 million. If the other $300 million are called below investment grade bond will decline another 17 million. So that's the additional capital and the fact that we are doing some below investment grade bonds is a slight to these calls.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Currently, there are no questions in the queue. I will turn the conference over to our host for any closing our additional remarks.", "Mark McAndrew", "All right. Thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations of Torchmark Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman; and Larry Hutchison, our co-CEOs; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2011 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the third quarter was $125 million or $1.29 per share, a per share increase of 10% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $1.36 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. With fixed maturities and amortized costs, our return on equity was 15.6% and our book value per share was $34.39, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share grew 20% to $44.86.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $454 million and life underwriting margins increased 13% to $130 million. Net life sales increased 7% to $83 million. On the health side, premium revenue excluding Part D, declined 4% to $170 million and health underwriting margin was $39million, same as year-ago quarter. Health sales were $15 million, down 6%.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the insurance operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. First I\u2019ll discuss American Income. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $167 million and life underwriting margin was also up 17% to $56 million. Net life sales increased 12% for the quarter to $41 million. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 5,472, up 23% from a year ago and up 3% during the quarter. We are pleased with the continued progress at American Income, and are excited about the company\u2019s future prospects. We continue to see growth in a number of newly hired agents who achieved our top bonus level. It\u2019s the first time, top bonus earners were up 47% in the third quarter. Our middle management ranks also increased by 14% in the third quarter. First time bonus earners and middle management trends are both indicators of future agent growth. We expect sales growth for 2012 to range from 13% to 15%, while we expect sales growth for 2013 to range from 10% to 15%.", "Now Direct Response. Our Direct Response operation worldwide life premiums were up 9% to $158 million and life underwriting margin increased 8% to $37 million. Net life sales were up 3% to $31 million. While we\u2019re pleased with Direct Response sales growth, it was slightly lower than expected in the third quarter, however, the new business written during the third quarter was more profitable than the new business written in a year ago quarter. We expect mid single-digit sales growth for 2012 and 2013.", "Now Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $70 million, while life underwriting margin was up 22% to $19 million. Net life sales declined 6% to $8 million, while net health sales declined 24% to $4 million. However, both net life and net health sales have increased sequentially for two quarters in a row. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,401, down 11% from a year ago, but up 4% just beginning of this year. The producing agent count grew to 1,420 during the first three weeks of the fourth quarter.", "We continue to make progress in turning around our producing agent counts in sales of Liberty National. We are optimistic that agent growth will continue going forward and expect sales growth to range from 8% to 12% for 2013.", "Medicare Part D, premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 63% to $83 million, while the underwriting margin increased 8% to $7 million. Part D sales for the quarter jumped 161% to $22 million due to the increase in low-income subsidized auto enrollees for 2012. We expect an increase of approximately 2% to 3% in our Part D premiums for 2013. This is less from the 2012 increase since we don\u2019t expect this many new auto-enrollees out of our low income subsidy program next year.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "To complete the insurance operations, administrative expenses were $41 million for the quarter, 2% more than a year ago quarter and in line with our expectations. For 2013, we expect a 5% to 6% increase in administrative expenses with most of the increase due to the acquisition of Family Heritage. However, as a percentage of premium, administrative expenses will be around the same level as 2012.", "Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define is net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, a decline of $9 million or 14%, 7% on a per share basis from the third quarter of 2011.", "Sequentially, excess investment income was down $8 million from the second quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines are due primarily to lower investment income. Compared to the second quarter, net investment income decreased $6 million or 3%, while average invested assets increased by 1%. And investment income increased at the same rate as the assets, investment income would have been up $1 million. This $7 million negative swing is due to the decline in the portfolio yield and the large increase in short-term investments, resulting primarily from the call of the $300 million of bank hybrid securities early in the third quarter. We plan to invest the excess short-term funds and bonds by the end of the year. Due to the expected call of our remaining $300 million of hybrid securities and the lower new money rates, we expect excess investment income in 2013 to decrease approximately 6% to 7%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect that 2013 excess investment income per share to be flat compared to 2012.", "Now, regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $11.8 billion including $10.9 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. There is no exposure to European sovereign debt and there are no commercial mortgage-backed securities or securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages.", "At September 30, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling $685 million compared to $180 million at June 30. The additional $505 million of cash in short terms is due primarily to the $268 million of proceeds due to debt instruments issued late in the quarter and $237 million of additional funds to be invested. Now, of this amount, $200 million will be used for the acquisitions of Family Heritage Life, we think on November 1st, $120 million for the retirement of our trust preferred debt this week and $94 million to retire the existing August 2013 debt issue.", "As to fixed maturities, $2.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus. Below investment grade bonds are $685 million compared to $764 million at the end of the second quarter and $721 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 6.3% compared to 6.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of three times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 21%, which is less than most of our peers. Both of these ratios have declined slightly since the end of the quarter as much of the excess cash held at September 30 has been invested in investment grade fixed maturities. Overall, the total portfolio is rated a high BBB plus just slightly under the A-minus of a year ago. We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.6 billion compared to $942 million a year ago.", "Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $326 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the utility and industrial sectors. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 4.42%, an average rating of BBB plus and an average life of 23 years. For the year, we have invested $755 million at an average yield of 4.54% and an average rating of BBB plus.", "The third quarter new money yield of 4.42% has declined from the 5.65% yield for all of 2011 and the 4.64% yield in the first half of 2012. Earlier this year, we indicated that the GAAP discount rates used to discount the reserves from policies issued in 2012 would be 4.75% graded to 6.5% over seven years. However, in response to the decline in new money yields and further indication that treasury rates will continue to be near current levels for the near future. We have changed the discount rates for policies issued in 2012 to 4.25% for five years, then graded up to 6.25% over the next eight years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.33% compared to 6.54% in the third quarter of 2011. As of September 30, the yield on the portfolio is 6.33%.", "As mentioned, we still hold $300 million of bank hybrids that could be called. We don\u2019t know whether they will be called in the fourth quarter, but expect all of them to be called by the end of 2013. These bonds yield 7.35% and assuming a 4.25% reinvestment rate, the loss to annual income with all of those securities are called will be $6 million after-tax. In our guidance, we assume that all will be called in 2013.", "On past analyst calls, we have discussed the current low interest rate environment and the impact of a lower prolonged rate scenario. Our concern regarding an extended period of low interest rate continues to be impact on earnings, not the balance sheet.", "As we talked about before, to maintain our underwriting margins, we\u2019ve raised the new business premium rates on the majority of American Income Life products and the Direct Response unit products by 5% as of January 1 this year. These increases provided additional margins to help offset reductions to excess investment income on new policies without having a detrimental impact on sales.", "However, as long as we are in this low interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and thus pressure excess investment income. However, the decline will be slowed by the fact that on average only 2% to 3% of fixed maturities will run off each year over the next five years and that assumes a call of the remaining $300 million of hybrid preferreds.", "In the second quarter, we conducted a stress test assuming a new money rate of 4.25% and determine that the portfolio yield at the end of 2016 would be in a range of 5.75% to 5.85%. At these rates, we would earn a small spread on the net policy liabilities, while earning the full 575 to 585 basis points on our equity. In this scenario, we will still generate substantial excess investment income.", "As I mentioned, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don\u2019t see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our shares repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $44 million to buy 874,000 Torchmark shares. For the full year through September 30, we have spent 318 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.6 million shares.", "The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand and the expected free cash flow from operations. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. The parent began the year with liquid assets of $74 million.", "During the first nine months of the year, we generated about $328 million of free cash flow but spent $318 million for Torchmark share repurchases. In addition to the remaining $83 million of cash and liquid assets, the parent received approximately $420 million as a result of the issuance on September 24th of 10-year senior notes and 40-year junior subordinated notes.", "As a result of this activity the parent ended the second quarter with $504 million of available liquid assets comprised of $74 million of beginning liquid assets plus the $328 million of free cash flow, plus $420 million of net debt proceeds, less the $318 million used for share repurchases.", "Going forward, along with the $504 million on hand at the end of the third quarter, we should generate approximately $22 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarters giving us $526 million of total cash and liquid assets available for the remainder of the year. Of this cash $120 million was used on October 24th to redeem our 7.1% trust preferred securities and approximately $212 million will be used to purchase the stock of Family Heritage Life, leaving us with approximately $194 million of cash and liquid assets available between now and the end of the year. It should be noted the $94 million of these assets will be invested to be used for the redemption of our $94 million of senior notes that mature on August 1, 2013 or an earlier time if opportunities to economically repurchase the August 2013 notes become available.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around in NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings that relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. At December 31, 2011, consolidated RBC was 336% and adjusted capital was approximately $46 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We expect our consolidated RBC as of the end of 2012 to be at or above this level.", "Now before I turn the call back to Larry, I would like to briefly discuss our recent debt issue and the purchase of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company. First the debt issue. With regard to our debt, on September 24, we closed on $300 million, 3.8% senior debt issue maturing in 2022. The senior notes were issued to provide $94 million to pre-fund the eventual retirement of our August 2013 senior notes and $200 million to fund the acquisition of Family Heritage Life.", "As we wanted to fund the majority of the Family Heritage Life acquisition internally, the parent issued $150 million of these notes to two of our insurance companies. Having these companies purchased the parent senior notes enabled us to one, efficiently use insurance company cash that resulted from the $300 million of bank hybrids they called in July and you get those funds invested at market rate.", "Two, provide funds to the parent to fund the acquisition in a way that will allow these insurance companies to fully admit the asset on their statutory books. Three, structure of the transfer of funds to the parent in a way that minimizes the RBC charges that will be incurred by the insurance companies. And four, structure of public debt issue that was large enough to obtain the most efficient pricing available in the market. It should be noted that the $150 million of notes owned by the two insurance companies are limited in consolidation and thus are not treated as outstanding debt or the invested assets on our consolidated financial statements.", "We also issued on September 24, $125 million of 40-year junior subordinated notes with an interest rate of 5% and 7%, 8%. Those notes are callable after five years and are issued to refinance $120 million of trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities were called on October 24. As a result for the new issuances, our debt balances as of September 30 increased by approximately $268 million, temporarily increasing our debt-to-capital ratio to 29.9% if the effects of the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity investments are ignored. However, this ratio will be reduced to 28.1% upon redemption of the trust preferred securities and to our normal levels once the august 2013 notes are redeemed.", "We expect our interest expense will increase in the near term due to pre-funding of both the retirement of our trust preferred securities and the August 2013 maturity, plus the additional debt incurred for the Family Heritage purchase. For 2012, we estimate that this increase over 2011 levels will be approximately $2.1 million, including $1.9 million in the fourth quarter. For 2013, we estimate that our total interest expense will be approximately the same as 2012 levels, assuming the august note is retired on its August 1st maturity. Once the August note is retired, we expect to save approximately 1.5 million in annual interest expense over pre-2012 levels.", "Now, with regard to the acquisition of the Family Heritage Life. On July 31st we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of Family Heritage Life Insurance Company, a privately-held supplemental health insurance provider, for approximately $218.5 million, including the assumption of $20 million in trust preferred securities with the remainder to be paid in cash. The ultimate purchase price is subject to closing adjustments to be paid using cash from a post-closing dividend from the company. We expect to close on November 1st assuming all regulatory approvals are received by that date.", "The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a specialty insurer focused primarily on selling individual supplemental health insurance products with a return-of-premium feature. We were attracted to the company because of its offering of protection oriented insurance to middle income families and that their sales are through Family Heritage has approximately 1,200 captive sales agents, 41 sales directors and over 223,000 policies in force.", "We are excited about the opportunity to work with the existing management, agents and employees of Family Heritage and currently intend to operate the company as a standalone operation.", "As of June 30, 2012 statutory admitted assets of the Family Heritage were approximately $526 million and net capital and surplus was $62 million. Premiums were $162 million in 2011 and $87 million through June 30, 2012. Since the transaction has not yet closed and the fair market value of company\u2019s fixed maturity portfolio and other assets are not yet known. The ultimate effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments cannot yet be determined. However, we anticipate that the company will add approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per share to Torchmark\u2019s net operating income in 2012, assuming a November 1 close and will add approximately $0.13 to $0.17 per share to 2013 operating earnings. Since we anticipate being able to take given distributions out of the company to fund the additional interest charges to be incurred by the parent, we do not believe the acquisition will have a material impact on our share buyback program.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. This is our guidance. For 2012, we expect our net operating income will be within a range of $5.15 per share to $5.19 per share. For 2013, we expect our net operating income will be within the range of $5.45 per share to $5.85 per share. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you, gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll first go to the side of Jimmy Bhullar. Your line is open.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi good morning. I had a few questions. The first one on just your premium conservation efforts, if you look at your lapse rates in most of the subsidiaries that actually been declining but American Income, the lapse rate this quarter was roughly flat with the third quarter of last year?", "Then secondly just on the Family Heritage deal, should the earnings ramp up as the year goes on or with the first quarter of next year be a normal quarter, just I wanted to get an idea on whether you plan to do any expense savings or any marketing initiatives that would either reduce or increase earnings in that the deal comes on your books?", "And then finally on Liberty National, you\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters of decent growth in the agent count of your sales expectations actually seem fairly positive as well. What gives you the comfort that this is not sort of a temporary blip in the agent count and what gives you the comfort as the thing that the agent counts are going to keep going from here on out.", "Larry Hutchison", "Yeah, I think just Liberty...", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, Jimmy as far as the lapse rates to the American Income. If you look back over the last couple of years, the third quarter is generally a higher rate and it\u2019s somewhat due to the timing of the new issues and the lapses that occur on those policies. We expect that rate to be lower in the fourth quarter. The third quarter for some reasons is just unusually high from American....", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Yeah. And quarter-over-quarter results actually had been getting better but even if I compare to the third quarter of last year, your lapse rates were actually flat whereas second quarter versus second quarter or first quarter versus first quarter, they were improving.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I...", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "It\u2019s one quarter, so I just wanted...", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, we don\u2019t \u2013 matter of fact we have seen benefits of the conversation. As you mentioned in the last story, so from the prior quarters, I think this is just, again I think that the third quarter is just an unusual quarter from a timing standpoint. And again I think in the fourth quarter if you go back to the improvement we\u2019ve seen in the older quarters.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "And secondly on Family Heritage I understood the question right. I would anticipate that the earnings for the first quarter that will grow from there. I don\u2019t think that the first quarter be indicative of the entire year, but we really haven\u2019t had a change as Frank mentioned to and to look at what the purchase accounting adjustments are going to be and right now we don\u2019t have a good feel for the facts around this going to be.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "But you don\u2019t plan on \u2013 the growth would be just as a organic growth in the business. You are not planning any extraordinary cost savings programs or marketing initiatives that would either increase expenses or reduce expenses overtime?", "Gary Coleman", "No, there is no cost reduction expense that we\u2019re factoring in and their expense ratios are very similar to ours and they\u2019re very efficient and so the growth as we expect will be the organic growth of sales.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "Jimmy, on Liberty National, we believe that the recruiting systems are in place. We\u2019re now meeting with the different branch managers in the system. They\u2019ve accepted that and the first three weeks of this quarter we\u2019ve seen continued, steady agent growth. So we believe that will continue. At Liberty National we plan to roll out a laptop presentation in January. We think this will further help in recruiting and training the new agents and we hope to see 20% of agents growth at Liberty National by 2013.", "Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the side of Randy Binner. Your line is open.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Thanks. So, it sounds like \u2013 and this is kind of a sales question and so it sounds like the laptops are rolled out in January for Liberty National. Back here in American Income, I guess and I would like to hear more color. I think you said middle manager accounts there are up 10%. If that could be clarified that\u2019d be great? And then I guess just trying to get color on the kind of the trend there and how sustainable the increase in the ranks of those sales managers is?", "Gary Coleman", "Randy, sales growth is sustainable. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see sort of the 25% agent growth per year. It should be in fact a 10% to 12% to 15% increase agent growth is sustainable and those focus it and American Income remains is recruiting, is looking at forward activity in those little agents. It\u2019s also management promotions. As we promote through those different levels of management and you\u2019ll see growth in the agency. So that\u2019s really the color to American Income as the both systems continue to be improved on that top is fully rolled that at the American Income, so we get cost of data feedback that we can check those trends.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "How about our recruiting, is there anything new going on, on the front end and how you\u2019re bringing in new recruits?", "Gary Coleman", "The Internet recruiting continues to be our biggest source of recruiting. The personnel recruiting is also an emphasis on American Income and personnel recruiting that involves college recruiting, different exciting recruiting. When you look at military recruiting, there\u2019s a new initiative. As the military downsizes and we see people come out of military, those are strong recruits of both the American Income and Liberty National. So we continue to look at new recruiting systems. We hope to look at Family Heritage, study their recruiting systems and having some of those in-house here.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "That\u2019s helpful. And just to clarify, did you say the middle men accounts up around 10%, I missed that number?", "Gary Coleman", "Let\u2019s see, I think I\u2019ve said that, up 14%...", "Frank Svoboda", "14%, yeah.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And how about in their trend in particular, is that able to stay at that level or does that settle down not extremely the low hanging fruit there is coming down?", "Larry Hutchison", "There\u2019s not low hanging fruit, it\u2019s having the system of automatic promotions, it will promote persons out of the agent level, first level of management, the line by asking the fresh level of management, the second level of management is the sustainable number.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to side of Chris Giovanni. Your line is open.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. Good morning. I guess first question just on kind of the guidance in the range. I mean the ranges I guess are getting wider at least in the past couple of years. So does that suggest that suggest that EPS visibility is declining some or is this just the issue with the drops in the timing?", "Gary Coleman", "Well Chris I think part of the wider range this year is Family Heritage and we haven\u2019t included that transaction. We have to study that transaction as we have a great deal into Torchmark, so that\u2019s some of the impact of why we are at range.", "Larry Hutchison", "And Chris I mean I think last year our range was $0.30, its $0.40 this year. And I agree with Larry that a big part of it is the Family Heritage.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then are there any other M&A opportunities you guys are currently exploring or at this point is it primarily going to be share repurchases?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, Chris we\u2019re always looking for M&A opportunities, but to find the type of company that we found with Family Heritage want us in the middle income market has kept the latency selling type of products that we like. There\u2019s not a wealth of those kind of companies out there. We\u2019ll continue to look and, but in the meantime I think the share repurchases will be the bulk of these of our excess capital.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then lastly just on the new money rate. I guess there was a little surprise just how well you guys were able to maintain the yields quarter-over-quarter, given what\u2019s spreads did in the quarter and then I guess also you guys shortened some of the duration of the maturities of the portfolio. So curious if you can comment some on kind of where you\u2019re thinking as you look forward here in the 4Q you talked about the 425 kind of the stress test that you\u2019ve done, is that the level of yield you guys are currently looking at?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yeah, that\u2019s what we\u2019re currently seeing. And one thing that benefited us in the third quarter, I think we\u2019ve talked about this before through a partner we\u2019ve got involved with some products...", "Gary Coleman", "Placements.", "Frank Svoboda", "Product placements and we\u2019ve, I think we\u2019ve done a $100 million of that, most of that was in the third quarter. And those are a little bit shorter but the yields are in between the 10 and 30 years off. We really look to get a strong yield on those on those particular investments and I think that helped for the quarter. That probably helped us get to the 442 but where we\u2019re seeing it today and mainly we\u2019ve invested so far which I think we\u2019ve invested well over $200 million already in October, it\u2019s a round up for 420 to 400 quarter range.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And still no plan to change the overall investment strategy?", "Frank Svoboda", "No, not at this point. It\u2019s just, the yield curve is too steep to drop down short and also it looks like rates are going to stay low for a while, and as I mentioned, we have been involved in the product placements where we had in the past. We\u2019re still looking for other types of investments but we just haven\u2019t found anything that\u2019s better, we feel that\u2019s better than the corporate bonds.", "Chris Giovanni \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the side of Sarah DeWitt. Your line is open.", "Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi good morning. On the 2013 EPS guidance, how much is embedded in your outlook in terms of share buybacks?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think we\u2019re assuming free cash flow of around $360 million to $370 million next year. And I think in our guidance we assume that our share repurchases would be around $360 million.", "Larry Hutchison", "That\u2019s correct, Gary.", "Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And so given that the midpoint of your guidance assumes about 9% EPS growth. It seems like you\u2019ve got 8% EPS growth just from share buybacks alone. So could that be conservative given that the core business have been growing, your Family Heritage coming on will be a partial offset from the redemption of hybrids but it just seems conservative. So am I thinking about that correctly or I am missing anything?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, I think one thing, it is going to factor into it is the \u2013 in fact there our excess investment income will be lower, I think I mentioned, it was probably 6% lower on a dollar basis and I think that\u2019s we\u2019re seeing that growth in the insurance side but that is a primary factor.", "Sarah DeWitt \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019re now going to side of Paul Sarran. Your line is open.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Yeah thanks, good morning. Was there any sort of cumulative true up in the quarter from the change in discount rate on 2012 new sales?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, there was. From an underwriting income standpoint it\u2019s pretty much awash. So there was an increase in the reserves but there is also decrease in amortization. Where there was an impact is in the excess investment income because of the increase in the interest on the net positive our goal is an average about $500,000 impact in the quarter.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. And on Part D, I don\u2019t think you mentioned it. Did you pick up any new LIS regions for 2013?", "Gary Coleman", "No we did not pick up new regions for 2013.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Did you keep the ones you added this year?", "Gary Coleman", "I think it\u2019s actually a reduction I think we had six regions in 2013 versus about 24 regions that we had in 2012.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, so do you disenroll those policy holders that you added this year then or do you keep them, you just don\u2019t add new ones. How does that work?", "Gary Coleman", "We did not disenroll this year\u2019s policy holders that...", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, if you just look at the numbers, we had, as Larry mentioned we had 21 regions last year and 15 of those regions were going to be able to key the auto science, but we\u2019re now going to get new, new auto science. And I think there\u2019s five reasons where we will get new auto science. So, the core amount of that is we\u2019re not going to see near the number of new auto science this year or in 2013 than we did in 2012.", "Frank Svoboda", "I think in these terms we\u2019re projecting premiums in 2013, this $327 million versus $319 million in 2012.", "Paul Sarran \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to side of Mark Hughes. Your line is open.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Yeah, thank you. Good morning. The life underwriting margin are stronger this quarter, to what extend is that sustainable?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think it was up slightly this year. I think if you look at the nine months, our life underwriting margin is 28% of premium and overall is 29% in the quarter. There\u2019s not a lot of difference there but I think it the indicative of what the entire year will be if it is more in the 28% range.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Right. And so for next year more or likely to be at 28% or slightly better?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah. I think in our guidance, it is slightly better than 28%. But again, we\u2019ll talk about just a smaller difference.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Right. The Direct Response business is something you\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to pick back up, what makes you feel good about that?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think there\u2019s three things and that is still good about the Direct Response business. In 2013, I think on circulation, we have about 3% as the current net sales will pick up about 10%. We have initiatives, for 2013 in our gold products, our durables products and our other mailings. So their combination of those items, I guess feel optimistic about direct response.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Right. A and just to be clear the guidance at this point does or does not include the acquisition?", "Gary Coleman", "It does include the acquisition of Family Heritage.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Does include it?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you we\u2019ll now go to the side of Steven Schwartz. Your line is open.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Hey good morning everybody. Just a follow up on Sarah\u2019s question, I guess I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble. It seems Gary you suggested that the interest rate of excess investment, excuse me, would be down about 6% to 7%?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah I say that on a dollar basis it will.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Right.", "Gary Coleman", "But for share basis it will flat.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay yeah. Your EBITDA at 360 of share repurchase I would imagine that your general account assets excels, stuff with the debt being paid off in August and whatever. It\u2019s still going to grow. So in your guidance, I think it would, in your guidance where are you thinking the yield goes to by the end of 2013. I think you\u2019re currently at 6.33. Where does that go to the by the end of 2013?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. Steve, first of all we think by the end of year, I think at the fourth quarter it would be 6.25 would be our yield on the portfolio.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "As I mentioned earlier we\u2019re assuming that the remaining $300 million of, I presume we get called in 2013 and they have an interest rate of I think 7.3%.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "And so we\u2019re looking at is by the end of 2013 the portfolio yield would have dropped from 6.25 to 6.04 and this sounds like these are very precise. These are our estimates. So that\u2019s those hybrids still have a big impact. Now going forward from that, we\u2019ll get back to where the decline in the portfolio yield is more like 10 basis points a year. But the next year we\u2019re looking for a little over 20% decline in the yield.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Well, you said your 604 versus 612, I guess you\u2019ve got to take averages. Maybe I\u2019ll get back with Mike offline. If I could, only Family Heritage, what are those agents thinking about their business post January 1, 2014. Do they see HCA as a growth driver or do they see that as a headwind?", "Gary Coleman", "They see an opportunity. Gary and I\u2019ve addressed the top agents within the system and they\u2019re excited about joining Torchmark. I think they see opportunities they\u2019re going to have with the recruiting. I think it will bring higher ratings to the company. And to be a part of Torchmark, I think it will be a positive to that agency force.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "No, I\u2019m sure you will. I was questioning more the macro environment, in ObamaCare and macro environment and how they see that?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, these are products that aren\u2019t subject to ObamaCare. These are products that fall aside healthcare reform.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "So these products are unaffected by that, I misunderstood your question, I apologize.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Thank you, Larry.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the side of John Nadel. Your line is open.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Hi, most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point. I\u2019ve got one little nitpicky one left, I suppose and it\u2019s on Part D. just looking at the quarters\u2019 results, third quarter results, perhaps somewhat weak on the margins versus what we\u2019ve seen here recently as you look out. Was it just sort of a blip or as you look out to 2013 what do we \u2013 what should we expect for the margin on the business?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, John first of all, we had an unusually high claim quarter. And so that\u2019s when we compare back to third quarter where we had an unusually large claim quarter there is a big difference, but the margin year-to-date on that business is at 10% and we think 10% of premium that we think that\u2019s \u2013 this will end the year at 10% of premium and that\u2019s not as surprising just because we price it at 10.5% premium. So we\u2019re very close to where we price that.", "John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to side of Sam Hoffman. Your line is open.", "Sam Hoffman", "Good morning, I had a question about premium growth. It looks like premium growth accelerated in the quarter from 5.7% to 7.2% and even if you exclude the part D, it accelerated from 1.4% to 3.6% and so that\u2019s the big step up in one quarter and it was driven I think by the direct response business. So I mean obviously if your premium growth accelerates by 1.2% every quarter, your growth rate is going to be much higher a year from now and so what I want to understand is what happened with the persistency in the business to cause that and how sustainable is it?", "Gary Coleman", "Well Sam, we are seeing advantage from better persistency but for example in direct response we had a 9% increase in premium, we\u2019ve been showing 5% to 6% increase. Well the reason we\u2019d 9% this year was more of an issue that the third quarter premiums of last year were very low and so it\u2019s just an unusual comparison. I don\u2019t think you can the numbers you extrapolate I think you can carry for our fourth quarter but we\u2019re looking for unlike the premiums next year and our guidance, we\u2019re going to be about 4.5% for this year. We\u2019re looking at next year being at least that much maybe to 5%. So we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re going to see improvement but maybe not at the level you\u2019re talking about.", "Sam Hoffman", "Okay. And then just can you clarify a bit about what you were saying about the discount rate and the price increase? I know you said that you lowered the discount rate at the beginning of this year, and you raised price but is that going to recur both the discount rate and the price increase in 2013? And then just help us understand what\u2019s in guidance and how we should think about that going forward?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, first of all, in the guidance we are assuming the same discount rate that I talked about earlier, the quarter-over-quarter graded up to six in a quarter. We don\u2019t feel like, we feel like the situation would be very similar next year in terms of rates and that will be appropriate. As I mentioned, we did raise rates, the premium rights 5% this year, the effect of changing the interest rate assumption from what we had last year to this year, this year really we require about 2% to 3% increase in premium. So we actually increased the premium rates higher than we really needed but that \u2013 so but going forward, we still feel like the new level that we\u2019ve gone in, the discount rates will be appropriate going forward.", "Sam Hoffman", "Okay. And, then I guess, my last question is on family heritage, can you talk bit about the business and just if you could repeat the premium growth that it had and kind of how much sales it has and should be expected to grow overtime?", "Larry Hutchison", "Frank, if you want to handle that.", "Frank Svoboda", "Sure Larry. Yeah, the total premium in 2011, they had around $162 million of total premium income. And we really look at them growing somewhere in that 8% to 9%, 10% range over the next couple of years. So far, year-to-date through June 30, they have premium income of about $87 million that was reported on their statutory financial statements. So obviously just looking toward annualizing that you end up at around $176 million or $175 million and that\u2019s around an 8.5% increase. So, we are again expecting that the premiums to go somewhere in that 8% to 10% range. I believe their sales but I don\u2019t have that that number handy but I believe that it was somewhere in the $50 million range.", "Sam Hoffman", "Okay. Thanks for taking the call.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to side of Bob Glasspiegel. You line is open.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "I\u2019m going to follow-up on Sam\u2019s question and try to drill a little bit deeper into the acquisition. It seems like that you\u2019re saying the midpoint of the range is $0.15 accretion which is $23 million of earnings and there is going to be $2 million to $3 million of, that\u2019s pre-tax earnings and is going to require $2 million to $3 million more of underwriting. So there is $25 million of sort of pre-tax income that needs to be spread either in the underwriting, so it\u2019s held for underwriting and/or investment income. But I think you said investment income, I think you said investment income is down 6 so that\u2019s not going to move. So, am I right that we need about $25 million of pretax of underwriting income?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, that is correct. It is going to be health business and it is somewhere in that range. We would estimate on a pre-tax basis yeah somewhere in that $25 million to 27 million range.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So, on the $180 million of premium it\u2019s a pretty good underwriting margin so we\u2019re talking about roughly 15%.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, the underwriting margins before admin expense are somewhere we expect for 2013 to be in the 14% to 17%.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay, my math is right.", "Gary Coleman", "And we do as time goes on and with new business we look forward to be slightly higher than that, but with the in-force block that\u2019s where we\u2019re estimating at this point.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Is there anything you can do with the capital structure, expense structure or cross-selling or better productivity and that\u2019s pretty good sales actually relative to their in-force but", "Gary Coleman", "With respect", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Within Torchmark on the margin that you probably haven\u2019t factored in here.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, with respect to let\u2019s say the capital structure, they are adequately capitalized at this point in time. They do have some excess capital if you will compared to what we would normally maintain a minimum 325% level. But at this point in time we do not anticipate taking out any of that excess capital if you will and allow that to help fund some of their future growth going forward. I think as Gary has mentioned earlier, there aren\u2019t a significant amount of any expense savings that we\u2019re really anticipating at this point. We will continue to look at their investment portfolio and to see whether or not there is some opportunities there and Larry I may pass it to you with respect to potential sales and potential sales initiatives going forward.", "Larry Hutchison", "The potential sales initiatives, first of all, is where the agency force, and to do that, it is two ways, one is better recruiting methods. The second is geographic expansion. They are concentrated in the upper Midwest and Texas and we think those products could be offered in New York, Canada, other parts of U.S. So that\u2019s another part of the expansion we\u2019re talking about was family heritage.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So, if you guys can\u2019t create any expense savings, this must be the most efficient small company on the planet?", "Gary Coleman", "Do you look at their expenses as a percentage of premium as it\u2019s quite low, it\u2019s a very well run company.", "Bob Glasspiegel \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "So it\u2019s impressive. Look forward to learning more about them as you hopefully own it in next week? Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go to side of Jeff Schuman. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Thanks, good morning. I understand that in part D there was volatility this quarter and there will be volatility some times, but can you remind us at this point do you, is there any sort of normal, kind of base line seasonality to the margins in that business?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Jeff, we really haven\u2019t seen it. I mentioned last year third quarter was low. We can\u2019t expect we might see that this year but we said it was higher. Yeah, this business is priced every year and we just said and the clients come at different times. We just haven\u2019t seen seasonality that we can count on.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, thank you. And then this should probably be obvious but just Jimmy I mean, I guess the excess investment income compares to the down six, does that exclude Family Heritage from both periods or is that just in 2013 and you\u2019re still down six?", "Gary Coleman", "That includes Family Heritage in both periods.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "In both periods, okay.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah. Remember for 2012, we only had them for two months but yeah it includes both periods.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "But includes it on a pro forma basis for 2012?", "Gary Coleman", "No, not on a pro forma basis.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "But over their actual additional access would be for those time of two months.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay I guess just for some modeling perspective, do you have idea how that compares and would have been on an apples to apples basis?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah. We\u2019ll have to find, I missed it, but I can find that...", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.", "Gary Coleman", "I have got it, excluding family service, excuse me Family Heritage, we would project for 2013 that excess investment income would be down somewhere, this is dollar amount not per share, dollars would be down somewhere between 7% and 10% and on per share basis, excess investment income would be a decline of 2% to 4%.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Gary Coleman", "With Family Heritage, I was saying earlier on per share basis it will be flat for 2013.", "Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 KBW", "Okay, thanks for clearing that up.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). It appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to our speakers for closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "All right, thank you for joining us this morning, those are our comments and we\u2019ll talk to you again next quarter.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Welcome to the Torchmark Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2012 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the second quarter was $133 million or $1.42 per share, a per share increase of 11% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $132 million or $1.43 per share a 5% increase on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of September 30 was 15.6% and our book value per share was $37.60, a 9% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $40.97, a 9% decrease due to the impact of higher interest rates and the valuation of our fixed maturity portfolio.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $471 million and life underwriting margins increased 7% to $139 million. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due to lower amortization on a deferred acquisition cost and the deferral of certain direct response Internet acquisition cost that had not been deferred prior to the second quarter 2013.", "The lower amortization rate is a result of improvements and persistency attributable to our ongoing conservation program and is incorporated in our guidance. Net life sales decreased 4% to $80 million.", "On the Health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, increased 23% to $209 million and health underwriting margin grew 19% to $50 million. Improvement in health premium and underwriting margin was due primarily to the addition of Family Heritage. Health sales increased 54% to $23 million also due primarily to the acquisition of Family Heritage.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on insurance operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. First, let\u2019s discuss American Income, which generates approximately 46% of our net life sales. American Income's life premiums were up 8% to $181 million and life underwriting margin was also up 4% to $59 million. Net life sales decreased 10% for the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,449 approximately the same as a year ago but down 2% during the quarter. We are disappointed with results for the third quarter at American Income.", "While the real driver of growth in this agency is going to be the development SGAs opening new offices, we did expect that the compensation changes made earlier this year would have had a more positive impact on sales and agent retention. We continue to modify and tweak the compensation systems and are confident that these changes, which are scheduled for January 1 implementation, will eventually generate improvement but our primary focus will be on opening new offices and the continual development of middle management to help ensure that we maintain a large pool of highly quality SGA candidates.", "We expect a net life sales decline for the full year 2013 within a range from 2% to 3%, but we expect sales growth in 2014 to be within the range 3% to 7% as the SGAs added in 2013 make an impact.", "Now, Direct Response, which generates approximately 42% of our life sales. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $164 million and life underwriting margin increased to 13% to $42 million. Net life sales were up 6% to $33 million.", "Response rates continue to improve slightly during the third quarter. We are seeing positive results on rate adjustments and higher face amount offerings on adult insurance products implemented during the second quarter. We expect low to mid-single digit net life sales growth for the full year 2013 and mid-single digit sales growth for 2014.", "Now, Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined to 2% to $69 million while life underwriting margin increased 3% to $19 million. Net life sales decreased 9% to $8 million while net health sales declined 6% to $4 million. Producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,320, down 6% from a year ago but 3% during the quarter.", "The turnaround at Liberty National has been a bit more difficult than we anticipated and we were disappointed with results for the quarter. While the transition to the new operating model and new mindset have been more challenging than expected of our traditional southeastern rural offices, we are pleased with progress of our geographic expansion.", "We opened four new offices in the second quarter, another in the third quarter and we plan to open two more this year. We are confident that expansion into more heavily populated, less penetrated areas will generate long term agency growth at Liberty beginning in 2014. We expect sales to decline within a range of 6% to 8% for the full year 2013, but expect to see low single-digit sales growth in 2014 as we start to see the benefits of geographic expansion.", "Now, Family Heritage. Health premiums were $48 million and health net sales were $11 million. Although results were slightly less than expected, we are still pleased with the integration of Family Heritage. We continue to implement our Internet recruiting system across the agency and believe that this will generate long-term sales growth as it becomes full incorporated.", "For 2013, we expect health premium incomes to range from $191 million to $192 million with margins as a percentage of health premium of about 18% to 20%. We expect sales of approximately $40 million -- $43 million to $45 million in 2013 and a mid-single-digit sales growth in 2014.", "Medicare Part D. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D declined 6% to $77 million while the underwriting margin increased 25% to $9 million. Part D sales for the quarter fell 58% to $9 million due to the decrease of low-income subsidized enrollees for 2013.", "We expect a decrease of approximately 4% to 5% in our Part D premiums for 2013 due primarily to price competition in the employer group market that we discussed on previous calls. However, we expect an increase in Part D sales and premiums in 2014 as we have qualified to receive new auto-enrollees in 15 regions in 2014, as compared to 7 in 2013. We will be better able to quantify that increase on our next call.", "I will now turn the call back over to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "To complete the discussion of insurance operations, administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter, 11% more than a year ago. The increase is in line with our expectation and is due primarily to the addition of Family Heritage and an increase in pension cost. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses for full year 2013 should be around the same level as 2012.", "Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $54 million, a decline of $1 million or 2%; but a 2% increase on a per share basis from the third quarter of 2012. Decline in dollars is due to lower new money yield and the call of $467 million of hybrid securities since June 30, 2012.", "For the full year 2013, we expect the decline in excess investment income to be approximately 7% to 8%. However, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect the decline in 2013 excess investment income per share to be around 3% compared to 2012.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $12.9 billion including $12.3 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $11.7 billion were investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds were $586 million, compared to $685 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.8%, compared to 6.3% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.5 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equities, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 17%, which is less than most of our peers.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, compared to BBB+ a year ago. In addition, in the portfolio, we have net unrealized gains of $489 million, compared to $1.6 billion a year ago. The decrease in net unrealized gains is due primarily to the recent increases in market interest rates rather than credit concerns.", "Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $133 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and utility sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.2%, an average rating of A and an average life of 30 years.", "For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.91%, down 42 basis points from the 6.33% yield for the third quarter of 2012. The decline in the yield is due primarily to the addition of lower yielding Family Heritage portfolio and the calls of the bank hybrid securities since the second quarter of last year.", "As of today, we still hold approximately $76 million of bank hybrids that we expect to be called at some point. However, we have not yet received the notice of intent to call on any of these securities. If all $76 million of these securities are called the lost annual income related to these calls would be less than $1 million after tax.", "We are encouraged by the higher treasury rates due to the positive impact that higher interest rates would have on our excess investment income. Even at the current new money rate we would expect to see only modest declines in the portfolio yields over the next five years compared to the larger declines in recent years.", "This development is due primarily to the hybrid calls being behind us and the expected maturities coming from bonds with lower interest rates than in the past. Even sudden interest spike could be beneficial as we have very little The Center mediation risk and we are not concerned about the potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio. As we have said many times, we have both the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our bonds to maturity.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position.", "First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the third quarter, we spent $85 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average cost of $70.45 per share. For the full year through September 30, we had spent $265 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.2 million shares at an average cost of $62.44 per share.", "The available liquid assets at the parent consist of assets on hand plus the expected free cash flow from operations. As we said before, free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "The parent entered the second quarter with liquid assets of $117 million. Assuming shareholder dividends remain at their current level, we expect free cash flow for the remainder of 2013 to be around $38 million. Along with the $117 million of liquid assets available as of September 30, the parent will have around $155 million of available liquid assets for the remainder of the year. Of this amount, we expect to retain approximate $55 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company. ", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of the remainder of the fund. So far in the fourth quarter, we have spent approximately $20.4 million to repurchase 284,000 shares at an average cost of $71.97.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current rating. For the last three years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325%. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. For 2013, we expect our net operating income within a range $5.68 per share to $5.72 per share. For 2014, we expect that our net operating income be within a range $6 per share to $6.40 per share.", "Those are our comments. We will now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "I had a question first for Larry. May be if you can discuss the driver of the decline in the agent counter American Income during the quarter and what gives you comfort that the results are going to improve? And then, secondly on Part D expectations obviously you are approved in more regions for auto-enrollees next year than this year. But I don't think you should see a commensurate increase in like premiums in the business because I think the regions are going up to 15 from 8 but may be you could discuss how much of a pickup you should -- you are expecting?", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy, in the third quarter the agent count didn't grow as you believe it would because the SGAs, our managers and agents have not responded as quickly as we had hoped to the compensation changes we initiated in the first or second quarter. We do believe we're going to have growth in 2014. In the first quarter we're going to have a new senior life product and a change in our compensation payment system, which should have a positive effect on agent activity. This compensation system change will result in agents being pretty more quickly, which should also help with agent retention. We also have a change in management compensation to tie bonuses to recruiting results and the senior product will allow agents utilize more of their leads. Part D if I heard your question correctly Jimmy I think you were asking for the guidance and what's going to happen.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Or just expectations because I think the number of regions already you enrolled is up almost twice as much next year versus this year but I think last year you had declined a lot but your premiums actually held up relatively well. So how it should be like -- should we expect a huge jump in premiums because of the increased number of regions that you had already enrolled in?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think the guidance we give at this time is we would expect the premiums for 2014 for Part D between a range of $330 million to $340 million as compared to approximately $300 million in 2012. We expect the margin of that business certainly to be between 9% and 11% ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted may be starting off with another question on American Incomes headcount and how it pertains to sales growth and if I understood correctly and in the past you talked about how the bottleneck been middle management there. And yet when I look at the how to say renewal agents those with at least one year experience that number has been actually been growing at a nice pace every quarter this year. So I'm wondering what else is going on there that's creating pressure on sales today?", "Gary Coleman", "Let's talk about middle management development first. Our middle management numbers really hasn't changed just beginning of the year because we haven't experienced growth in new agents. We just had fewer candidates to promote -- for promotion to management positions, that's slight decrease at the MGA level is in part because we opened eight new offices and we call that Florida MGAs and to open offices. So we would think we'll see the change next year as we pick up our agent recruiting that begins to increase.", "Also I'm going to add as far as the middle agents growing, that is the pattern that we expect when we talk about retention the fact that our retention is not as in the first year items especially the first six months that they are involved in and that's the retention figure that we're trying to improve.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So is the focus then more on these first year agents or is it still about growing the bench above potential middle management agents?", "Larry Hutchison", "It's both. We know we need to grow middle management; we have more SGAs to enlarge our offices or to expand our offices.", "Gary Coleman", "And it's also important to have the middle management to train the new agents properly. So I agree with Larry it's both the agents and the middle management.", "Larry Hutchison", "We talked about the compensation changes we initiated in the first and second quarter, those compensation changes you directed towards first your agents, what we're trying to do is get an agent that normally would have left in the third month who would may be leave in the fifth, sixth, or seventh month. So we get that additional production agent that cascades through those numbers. Your fourth, fifth, six month agents; so hopefully with these compensation changes they receive a bonus as they stay longer that will have more production from those first year agents.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So when you talk about these being somewhat disappointing results from your perspective is it disappointing on the first year agent growth or is the disappointment on the middle management? Thanks.", "Gary Coleman", "I'm disappointed at both levels. We have not had the first year agent growth we've expected because of lack of retention, which is not responding to these compensation changes. Likewise, we doesn't have the activity levels that we would expect from our managers in terms of recruiting and causing activities as they train those agents. That's why we changed the compensation, effective January 1st. So different compensation change, it ties, that managers bonuses to the activity of those first year agents and it also ties that bonus to recruiting new agents in the office.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "And then, Liberty National. So if you're forecasting 1-6/8th [ph] sales declines for the full year that implies, call it 10%, 12% may be sales declines in the further quarter. So that seems like its still going the wrong direction. And I was curious a) why we're still moving in the opposite direction from the desired direction and b) how you get from there to a more positive environment in '14?", "Gary Coleman", "", "We get there in two ways. First of all, agent productivity we think will come up in 2014. Agent productivity is slightly down as we just opened four offices in the last quarter, and we opened one this quarter and we opened seven more. We have more experienced agents. As those agents become more experienced with a higher level of productivity. The other change we've had at Liberty this year has been the limitation of a laptop. That rollout will be completed by the end of November and following that rollout, the laptop directors will begin to follow to make sure that all the officers are using the laptop effectively. I think we talked about in last call that change in that system actually is a little bit of a step backward.", "I would say that the other change is that as we've changed the culture we've changed the recruiting methodology of Liberty, some of the more experienced agents have liked the system and we think that downturn is now complete. We will start to build that agency count.", "Gary Coleman", "The other thing that I would add, you're right fourth quarter was -- is projected to be about 11% decrease but that's one it's a bad comparison. The fourth quarter of 2012 is by far their highest quarter from the issued standpoint. Well actually, it will be slight but we will see sequential increase in sales of Liberty in the fourth quarter, may be 1% to 2%.", "Operator", "And we will take a question from Sarah DeWitt from Barclays.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays", "American Income. Can you just elaborate on what were the compensation changes you made previously that have caused so much disruption this quarter and how does the new changes differ from the old ones and why does that give you so much confidence that that will be effective and we won't have an ongoing issue there?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Well again, we were disappointed in third quarter because as I stated earlier, the SGAs, the managers and agents didn't respond as quickly we had hope to these compensation changes. You've to think about agency, it takes a while to institute a compensation change and have that flow through an agency. We will make a compensation change, as based on trends, we've seen six or eight months ago. We -- our sales management has experienced they were former SGAs, as they changed their management they first discussed that with field, we then test those management changes and then we have to see the implementation for retention bonuses, to see what effect as you all have retention bonus in the third quarter, it takes three, four or five months to begin to see the effects of that.", "And we're confident that there is only a positive impact, this has been slower to hit that agency. Early in the year, we have reduced some management bonuses. And you've to change your bonuses from time-to-time to keep the compensation system as an incentive to the direct behavior. There was a negative reaction to those reductions. And as we introduced the new management bonus system in January of 2014, Sarah we believe that will have an impact and will bring the activity and enthusiasm of that agency back to a normal level.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "And then, just switching share -- switching gears to share buyback. Is there a -- how do you think about the valuation there on buying back your stock? And is there a level at which you have to slow or sought share buyback?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yeah, Sarah we -- I think we talked about in the past. We all calculated intrinsic value what we think intrinsic value of the stock is and we monitor the actual price to that intrinsic value and that's a very important consideration as to whether we buy shares. If we felt we were fully valued, we would stop share repurchase and use that cash for other millions, but although, our intrinsic value is closer to -- or excuse me, our share price is closer to what we think fair value is, it's still not there yet. And we still think that the stock price or the stock is a goodbye, especially when you consider the risk adjusted return we get on share repurchases versus other alternatives that we can invest in.", "But we continually watch that and if we -- if the price gets to the point where we think it is fairly valued, we will look at other uses of the cash and part of it may -- our purpose is return the cash to the shareholders and we would -- it would be a board decision, but we might consider special dividend or whatever. But we just do not feel like we have gone to that point yet.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And how do you measure intrinsic value?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, the method we have used for years is just without going into a lot of detail where you value the current equity and divide present value of future premiums or future income and I think we're fairly conservative with it. But we also talked to other people as to what bankers and all what they think the value is and we're -- and again we're not saying our values that we come up with is the best value. But what we do is we're constantly we've done this for years, compare the what tiers are actually trading to do it what that intrinsic value is has always been the less in net value and it hasn't gone to the point where the share price is at that value that intrinsic value. So that's what we still consider the stock repurchases the best use of cash.", "Operator", "And we'll take a question from Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "I'm going to hit sales again but just from a different angle and with Torchmark we talk a lot about very kind of granular details on agents, recruiting, compensations, et cetera which I appreciate. But just kind of thinking mere more broadly AFLAC, U.S. CNO Financial two names I cover have seen, lower sales than what we thought would be over the last few quarters. And so I guess moving away from the specifics especially America Income more broadly is there something going on out there that's making it harder for agents to be successful. Is it the economy, gas prices? Is there kind of an external environment change that you're seeing in your business that might be part of the explanation for some of these sales challenges?", "Gary Coleman", "I don't think there is an overall trend of returning sales. I do think it's more difficult for agents today to set appointments and with the advent of the onset of do not call us as people moved away from landline phones to cell phones, it's hard for an agent to make appointments. But we've overcome that as we introduce new software that helps set appointments be more efficient in these calls.", "Larry Hutchison", "I think if you look at -- just look broader at American Income and if you go back and look at historical trends it's really unusual for American Income to have two very strong years in a row. If you go back in the last 10 years there are four years we have double-digit growth 17%, 18%, 18%, 12% growth. There's also years where we have negative growth. I can see years in that 10-year cycle we were down 9%, we were down to 8%, we were down this year projecting 2% to 3% following a double-digit growth year. What we do know is the accumulative growth is very strong and that your agency grows and your sales grow on a stair step pattern. So I think that's really what's going on in our mechanism.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets", "And I guess would the same comments by I was kind of talking probably about the dynamic to your Liberty, I mean same thing or to me that's a little bit different, right it's a more narrow, geographic set?", "Gary Coleman", "I would say Liberty is quite different. We restructured Liberty at the end of 2010 to a variable cost model. The current restructuring of Liberty is twofold. One is changing the culture of Liberty. There is a growth culture, not a production culture. The second change is what we talked about is geographic expansion. We know that we try to expand offices in the Southeast is probably not going to work based on the last 20 years experience. But we do know as we look at these new offices we can expand Liberty and say adapt the new systems for recruiting, for selling. We're seeing positive results in these new offices. So the future of Liberty is really a different future, which is expand outside of Southeast and to adopt these new systems.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.", "Mark Finkelstein - Evercore", "Direct response. I guess, we'll go through sales again. I guess I was also surprised that were up 6% pretty easy comp, you have a new product with a kind of higher face value that should attract the different audience, what is going on there and what gives you the confidence that that should improve?", "Gary Coleman", "What we're thinking the fourth quarter growth the strong growth has to come from our adult insurance product rate implementation and our continued introduction of higher face offers, we have the internet inquiry fulfillments, some new packaging coming out. I remember at Globe when we talk about a rollout? There's not a single rollout. As we rollout the adult product we're doing further testing on packaging on rates and we see some further growth not just from the rollout as we tweak the packaging and the pricing that products will go forward. We feel very good about it worldwide and in 2014 sales results are projected.", "Mark Finkelstein - Evercore", "Is there anything in these response rates that kind of has changed fundamentally?", "Gary Coleman", "No, as we said we saw a slight improvement in response rates in the third quarter. We saw noticeable increase in price of electronic campaigns, and all electronic circulation enquiries were about the same. But part of the response relates are tied to the economy. We're pleased that we're seeing some progress in economy on jobs; gas prices have been stable. So we think those are other improvements that help response rates.", "Mark Finkelstein - Evercore", "And then just on Family Heritage I guess I was surprised by the agent decline I was also surprised by the sales decline sequentially. Obviously this is a recent acquisition you're focused on changing the recruiting dynamics and focused on geographic expansion. Is this just part of the kind of the ongoing integration or there are anything that we need to be worried about on this?", "Gary Coleman", "Well I think that's part of the ongoing integration and you need to remember Family Heritage has just completed its first year under Torchmark after spending its first 23 years as a private company it takes some time for them to aciculate to our new recruiting system, You have different incentives. There are cultural changes. We think this is going to be a temporary adjustment and part of our optimism was based on the fact that Family Heritage has not lost as a single owner of any other agency, since been acquired by Torchmark. In fact we have had several agency owners this year; we think one of the positive impacts on 2014.", "The other change at Torchmark is we're going to provide Family Heritage with some additional product and marketing support through the fourth quarter of '13 into 2014, which should further help the results. But we're optimistic about some growth of Family Heritage in 2014.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Christopher Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Just wanted a follow-up on direct response. So there, any I guess numbers you can give us in terms of may be percentage of new sales that are above kind of the original 50,000 limit. So I guess sort of how should we be tracking the penetration of the higher face amount policy?", "Larry Hutchison", "Just so I don't have those specific numbers in front of me. I can tell you it's reflected in our guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2013 and the 2014.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "And then I guess at this point how should we thinking about Liberty I think midyear, I think you talked about sort of being the most optimistic you've been in sometime around there and clearly the point to a laptop there's an opportunity. Has it just been just a slower implementation of the laptop strategy or I guess what's kind of derailed the stories as you know clearly restructuring took place during '12? And then do you still have the confidence that kind of 10% to 12% growth longer-term setting aside may be '14 still being a transition year, do you still feel like that's a metric you can achieve ?", "Gary Coleman", "I don't think the story Liberty has changed. I think we're still optimistic. As I stated it has taken longer to implement the changes in the system and remember the laptop is only for the individual life sales, which is about half of the sales at Liberty National. It's taking -- so it will take until November to fully roll that out. Once it's rolled out you have to go back to inspect that system and its always not an instantaneous change or improvement if we will see results of the laptop and individual sales through 2014.", "Remember at Liberty about half of those sales are in the workplace, and there is a new system introduced for workplace sales in terms of how you recruit to that, how you prospect on that, so it's taken most of 2013 to implement also the new work site selling system and we should see the benefit of that into 2014. And I probably have been too optimistic about Liberty. I'm optimistic about the long-term results as just it takes longer than we anticipate to change systems, change improving, and change culture in the company.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "And then lastly just the over six month retention rate in American Income where do we stand on that today?", "Larry Hutchison", "Are you talking about 13 months retentions for agents or?", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Yes.", "Larry Hutchison", "I don't have the numbers in front of me. We look retention from first month to 13 month retention. And we're trying to convey that as you see the agency gradually grow or not grow. Off the top of head I can't tell you what that numbers for six month retention.", "Gary Coleman", "Well the 13 month retention is down a little bit but it I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. But we -- what we do know is that it's down because of we're losing in the third to sixth month at a greater rate than we had in the past.", "Larry Hutchison", "What I see, what I talk to Scott Smith, the President of the Company, and Rogers as the CEO, they're somewhat optimistic what they see is some uptick in recruiting numbers and the uptick in the recruits come through that pipeline those recruits turn into coded agents that are selling business. As you have more agents that are selling business your retention rate should do up. Generally optimistic based on the testing that they have done with the compensation changes I think we will see retention gradually increase starting in the first quarter of 2014.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "So the six months, is certainly being critical because I think just over half the sales come from agents that have been there longer than six months. So that's your focus and you think this commission structure will help address that kind of lower retention rate?", "Larry Hutchison", "If the commission structure addresses the retention remember there is two changes in the compensation system. The first is a bonus system that rewards longer retention. The second is a change in bonus levels that increases activity. As you increase activity of agents and you increase activity of managers it reflects on a higher retention rate.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Vincent Lui from Morningstar.", "Vincent Lui - Morningstar", "Just want to go take a look at the investment portfolio. I notice that you've been gradually increasing the duration of bond portfolio from about 26 years to 29.7 years this quarter. Could you give some general comments on that? Is that -- is it a change in the strategy? Are you trying to position in some ways for rising rates in the future?", "Gary Coleman", "Vincent, there really hasn't been a change in strategy. A lot of it depends on what's available in the market. We do invest long as we talked about before because our policy liability is long. If you go back and look at the last -- really last four, five quarters, it varies because third quarter of last year we -- I think it was 23 years and it's been around 25, 26 I think 29.", "Vincent Lui - Morningstar", "May be the highest --", "Gary Coleman", "It's just -- I think it's -- we haven't changed the strategy I just think that was what was available.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "Question, it seems like some of the tweaks that you're making trying to get sales going or offering the agents are little bit more of the or the customers a little bit more and there's a tradeoff between margins and sales that you're balancing all the time. I mean, with margins very strong and sales a little bit disappointing. Now the changes you're making margin neutral or margin negative recognizing that new sales don't move the aggregate needle that much?", "Larry Hutchison", "Changes are margin neutral, Bob.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "Margin neutral?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, margin neutral. The changes aren't just compensation. We recognize compensation as the biggest driver of agent activity and retention. There is also system changes. Now the lead mapping system I talked about makes those agents more effective so they have more presentations they can make in a week. Another positive we see within American Income they've increased their leads whole by 10% this year. That's a positive. We know that agents have more leads to set more appointments, have higher sales, that increases their income, they're going to stay with the company longer, hopefully transition in that management role. So there are systems, there are lead changes besides the compensation and we think are positive signs going towards the higher growth rate in 2014.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Bob, we allowed -- we've always had bonuses and we allowed for bonuses in setting our pricing, our margins. It's really, what we're talking about is moving that margin money to incentivize different behavior; it's all part of our normal margin.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "And I didn't hear did you give your estimate for statutory earnings for 2013 and what the free cash flow for 2014 might be?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yeah, Gary, I will go ahead and take that. We did not give an estimate as far as statutory earnings was concerned for '13. We had not yet completed our third quarter statutory results. We do think that our RBC as of the end of the year should be roughly in line with where we were at the end of 2012. As far as our -- what's built into the kind of midpoint of our guidance for 2014, we are estimating free cash flow, stock buyback in the range of $360 million to $370 million.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "It's fair to say this would be a going statutory earnings year given the lack of credit issues that have hit the portfolio, is that a fair assumption?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yeah, I mean investment income, there is still a drag on investment income just in general on the statutory just as you've seen GAAP side. So --", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "Right. I'm talking about credit losses aren\u2019t giving like what you're modeling, I mean you allow for certain credit losses a year in your modeling --", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, from a credit loss perspective, yes, it's been a very good year.", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, we will give better estimates when we do the full quarter call; we will have statutory information by then to give a better estimate.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "Okay. So a little guesstimate on how nine months is running versus a year ago, just a percentage increase?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, I really don't have that.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney", "Ballpark?", "Frank Svoboda", "I really don't have that at this point.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take a question from Erik Bass from Citi.", "Erik Bass - Citi", "Just a question on productivity at American income. It looks like you just look at sales versus agent growth over the past year or so, the sales have lagged suggesting that productivity has declined, and can you just talk about what's driving this nearly some of it is probably mix of new hires. And so may be if you have any data on sort of how productivity is trending for agents with different amounts of experience?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, on overall if you look at per agent production in 2013 versus 2012, the per agent production has decreased in 2012 but only about 3% as compared to 2013. And as I stated earlier, I think part of that it's more difficult to set sales appointments from the telephone. To offset that difficulty we are making system changes. And productivity is tied to agent activity. As we see more agent activity we will see our productivity slightly rise.", "Erik Bass - Citi", "Okay. And maybe just another question on just how you view some of the new initiatives that competitors are rolling out to try to reach more middle income consumers, things like kiosks at Wal-Mart and whether you view that as a competitive threat? And I guess, just be interested in your opinion on kind of how much potential you think alternative distribution models have been in the lower-to-middle income segment of the market?", "Larry Hutchison", "", "We do not see as a treat. What we know is we serve an underserved market and when we look across our distribution, what we are not seeing as any replacement activity from competitors. Also, we are the only agents in the home and we are a niche, I think of our union business. So there is not a competition issue for us as people try and seek the middle income market. Well, life insurance is something you have to sell across the kitchen table. So we will take a look at what (inaudible) kiosks but it not a product that sells itself. And so we are more comfortable to make sales projections looking at agency growth as the driver of production rather than bringing that new products for the completion. We are really a sales organization. Our focus is more in that sales organization to reach more of that middle income market.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Can you give us an estimate for excess investment income either on a absolute bases or per share basis for next year?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yeah, Mark, we are -- we guided declined in excess investment this -- income this year 7% to 8%, we are going to reverse that next year. And in dollar amount the excess investment should increase in the 7% to 8% range. And a good part of that is because we are going to see growth in investment income. The $467 million of hybrid calls had a tremendous impact reduction-wise on the 2013 income. As I mentioned earlier, that is behind us. So now the growth in -- and with the higher new money rates, the growth in investment income will not be as high as the growth in asset, but it's going to be much closer. So we will see growth in the income and our policy obligations, interest on policy obligations will grow in about the same range. And actually our interest on the debt calls will be lower. When you add all that together you will get to about a 7% to 8% increase in the midpoint of our guidance.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "I had just one question on the 2014 sales guidance. Since a lot of it depends on the initiatives and the tweaks of existing initiatives, should we expect to the sales growth to be back-weighted next year or is it roughly even throughout the year?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think it will be a little bit back loaded because if you put in initiatives in the first quarter, you will see those pull through more in the second, third and fourth quarter and the first quarter, that would be our expectation. That's not true to direct response because those initiatives were started in the second and third quarter this year to do additional testing. We think we will see the same kind of road, kind of Globe Life in action that we saw this quarter and projected in the fourth quarter, so that is in our guidance.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).", "And it appears we have no further question.", "Gary Coleman", "", "All right.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2012's 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $134 million or $1.46 per share, a per share increase of 10% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $143 million or $1.56 per share, a 1% decrease on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity was 15.5% and our book value per share was $38.77, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $41.49, a 10% decrease due to the impact of higher market interest rates and the valuation of our fixed maturity portfolio.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $468 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $137 million. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due to the lower amortization on deferred acquisition cost and the deferral of certain direct response internet acquisitions cost that had not been deferred prior to the second quarter of 2013.", "The lower amortization rate is a result of improvements and persistency attributable to our ongoing conservation program and is incorporated in our guidance. We are pleased with the results of our conservation program and expected to see continued improvement and persistency. Net life sales were flat at $83 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. However, they increased 4% over the third quarter of 2013.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, increased 6% to $215 million and health underwriting margin grew 11% to $49 million. Improvement in the health premium and underwriting margin was due primarily to the addition of Family Heritage. Health sales increased 13% to $40 million, also due primarily to the acquisition of Family Heritage.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the insurance operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. First, let's discuss American Income, which generates approximately 39% of our life premiums. American Income's life premiums were up 6% to $182 million and life underwriting margin was up 4% to $59 million. Net life sales decreased 5% in the quarter to $38 million. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 5,302, up 2% over a year ago and down 3% during the quarter.", "While we indicated on our last call, the sale should be down for the year, the fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than we anticipated. The changes that were made in 2013 just didn't create the results we hope for. However, while sales were lower than expected, they did increase sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter by 3%.", "We said on the third quarter conference call that we expected changes to be implemented early in the first quarter to promote increased enthusiasm and activity in the field in 2014. While we are still implementing these changes, we do believe they will drive increases in agent retention and sales activity.", "We plan to open six new offices in 2014, and we'll continue to focus on developments of middle management to develop new SGA candidates. In 2014, we should start to see the results from the recent initiatives and the SGAs added in 2013 will also begin to make an impact. We expect life sales growth in 2014 to be within a range of 3% to 6%, as most of the growth coming in the third and fourth quarters.", "Now, Direct Response, which generates 35% of our life premiums. In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $162 million and life underwriting margin increased 19% to $41 million. Net life sales were up 8% to $34 million.", "Response rates improved again during the fourth quarter. We are continuing to see positive results on rate adjustments and higher face amount offerings on adult insurance products implemented during the second quarter. We expect life sales growth for 2014 to be in a range of 5% to 9%.", "Now, Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $68 million. Our life underwriting margin declined 6% to $19 million. Net life sales decreased 4% to $8 million, while net health sales increased 2% to $4 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National end of the quarter at 1,430, up 1% from a year ago, but up 8% during the quarter.", "We are pleased with the trends we are seeing at Liberty National. While sales were down during the fourth quarter, they were significantly higher than we had anticipated. Our efforts to expand geographically are progressing nicely is evidenced by the increase in agent account from the third quarter through the fourth quarter.", "We opened six new offices in 2013. As agents in these offices become more experienced, their productivity will improve. We expect to open five more new offices at Liberty in 2014. As we've said before, we are confident that expansion into more heavily populated less penetrated areas will generate long-term agency growth at Liberty, beginning in 2014. We expect to see sales growth in 2014 in a range of 2% to 5%.", "Now, Family Heritage. Health premiums were $49 million and health net sales were $11 million. We continue to work on our recruiting systems across the agency and believe that this will generate long-term growth. We expect growth in health sales at Family Heritage in 2014 to be in a range of 2% to 7%.", "Medicare Part D. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D declined 13% to $73 million, while the underwriting margin was flat at $10 million. Part D sales for the quarter increased 15% to $53 million due to the increase in loan income subsidized enrollees in 2014.", "We expect an increase of approximately 13% to 15% in Part D premiums in 2014, because we have qualified to receive new auto-enrollees in 15 regions in 2014, while we received new auto-enrollees in seven region in 2013.", "I'll now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "To complete the discussion of insurance operations, administrative expenses were $46 million for the quarter, 3% more than a year ago. The increase is in line with our expectation and we anticipate that administrative expenses should remain relatively flat in 2014 and be approximately 5.7% of premiums.", "Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a decline of $1 million or 2%, but a 3% increase on a per share basis from the fourth quarter of 2012.", "For the full year 2013, excess investment income decline 8% on a dollar basis and 3% on a per share basis. This decline was due to lower new money yields and the call of hybrid securities that occurred in late 2012 and early 2013.", "2013 was the third consecutive year that excess investment income declined. In 2014, we expect to see a reverse of this downward trend. We expect excess investment income to increase by approximately 5% to 6% in 2014. Further, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, we expect excess investment income per share to increase about 10% to 12% compared to 2013.", "Now, regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $13 billion, including $12 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $11.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds were $566 million compared to $585 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.5% compared to 4.9% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.5x, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%, which is less than most of our peers. Overall, total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago.", "In the fourth quarter, we invested $319 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and utility sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.4% on average rating of BBB+ at an average life of 25 years.", "For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.90%, down 30 basis points from the 6.20% yield in the fourth quarter of 2012. Most of this decline occurred early in 2013, due primarily to the lower new money yields and the calls of the bank hybrid securities. Portfolio yield declined only 5 basis points between the second and fourth quarter.", "We are encouraged by the higher new money rates, due to the positive impact that high interest rates have on our excess investment income. At the current new money rate, we would expect to see only modest declines in the portfolio yield over the next five years as compared to the larger declines in recent years. This development is due primarily to the high recalls being behind us and the expected maturities coming from bonds with lower interest rates in the past.", "Even sudden interest rate spikes would be beneficial, as we have very little disintermediation risk and are not concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio. As we've said many times, we have both the intent and more importantly ability to hold our bonds maturity.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. First, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets.", "In the fourth quarter, we spent $95 million to buy 1.27 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $74.45. For the full year, we spent $360 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.5 million shares at an average price of $65.21.", "The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $60 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2014. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "While our 2013 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2014 to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million. Thus, including the $60 million available from assets on hand, we currently expect to have between $430 million and $440 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. To date, in 2014, we have used $40.2 million of this cash to buy 529,000 Torchmark shares.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance companies. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Although, we haven't finalized our 2013 statutory financial statement, we expect the RBC percentage at December 31, 2013, will be slightly above the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2014.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2014, we expect that our net operating income will be in a range of $6.05 per share to $6.35 per share. Those are our comments. We'll now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "I had a couple of questions, first one on capital. I think you mentioned $430 million to $440 million of available cash. And if you keep $50 million to $60 million of a cushion that means like buybacks of around 380-ish or so for the year, is that the right way to think about that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, you should. We expect the buybacks to be right in that or the free cash flows in that $370 million to $380 million range.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then on the business, maybe Larry on Liberty National, how much of the growth in agent count is coming just from the new offices that you're opening up versus growth at existing offices? And then on the related count, the agent count at American Income, you mentioned that some of the initiatives that you had implemented haven't like gained traction as fast as maybe you thought. Can you discuss, what's you're doing and what gives you comfort that trends will get better in 2014?", "Larry Hutchison", "At Liberty National, the agent growth is coming from the new offices. We also see some increase in existing offices. So it comes from both sets of offices. American Income, we just did not see the expected correction in agent retention or agent activity we hoped for, and we made the changes in retention bonuses earlier in 2013.", "The sales growth in 2014 will come primarily from the bonuses structure change, we began implementing last month. This change is aimed at increasing agent compensation early in agent's career and encouraging greater agent activity. The bonus change also affects managers, because it ties their compensation, Jimmy, to increased recruiting and agent retention.", "We have tested these changes in the third and fourth quarters of 2013, before they were implemented. And then additionally simplify the commission process, so that our agents will have a greater certainty of payment at the point of sale at American Income.", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, I might add. For the six new offices, I think we have 86 agents from those offices.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then on Part D, like you are in 15 regions, you were in seven last year. Should we assume that premiums were double or obviously there is a difference in size of all the regions than the market folks that you have? So could you discuss like how that relates to expected premiums?", "Gary Coleman", "Our premiums last year were approximately $300 million. We expect our premiums this year to be approximately $340 million. And most of that pickup comes from the additional regions, where we receive auto-enrollees. We get different numbers in different regions. I don't think it's fair to see with double.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "The number of auto-enrollees would not necessarily double, but overall premiums I guess you're expecting a little bit north of 10% up?", "Gary Coleman", "That's correct.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "Larry, a follow-up on Jimmy's Part D question. I know obviously, you have your regular enrollees, you also have auto enrollees and the number of characterized auto-enrollees is doubled, so that's the thing. What I'm not quite understanding is that your in force went from about $300 million to $322 million at the end of this quarter versus the third quarter, that's an 8% increase. My understanding was that the sales for the first quarter are reflected at the end of the fourth quarter, is that not accurate? I'm trying to find out where this other 7% is going to come from basically, because you'd been averaging about $300 million of gross premium in force?", "Larry Hutchison", "I'm thinking about your question. With the auto-enrollees, some of those come each quarter, but we're going to be having auto-enrollees throughout the year, Steven. I don't know if I can track back instantly what the percentages are each quarter, but I do have confidence that the premium number we're giving you is fairly close, which you'll see for the year of about $340 million.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates", "Margin in Part D, I think it was about 11.8% for 2013?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think we're producing about 10% margin for Part D in 2014.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "You're looking for investment income to start moving up. I assume your comments are predicated with the 10 year where it is. I suspect maybe your spreads have won and the stuff you're buying isn't going down in line with treasuries this year?", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, we have seen a little bit of decline in the rates, but we're still investing this quarter near the 550 that we've assumed in our guidance for the year.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "So 255, 10 year doesn't really impact you. You're not looking this to like a blip and rates you're going to move up, this is the real-time based on where we are today?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think our 550 is based on a little bit -- we don't look so much at the 10 year, but to 30 year side. And the 550 was based on a little bit higher 30 year rate than we have right now, but it's not materially different.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "It's not a regular period, so just slight uptick from where we are right now in yields?", "Gary Coleman", "I think we feel confident of the 5.5 for the year.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And as we think about your conservation program on the life side, what sort of persistency improvement can you see from it?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think we see improvement both in our first year and renewal year rates. And I think we have scheduled out on the web site that showed that improvement. In 2013 we conserved $38 million of lapse premium, that's about 15% of our lapses for the year. And we think we can continue to increase our percentage. We think within a couple of years we'll be around 17% of life's premium.", "The good thing about it is that once that premium is conserved, we're seeing about the same persistency, as a matter of fact a little bit persistency than we do in our other business. But at some point the improvement in persistency will level out a little, that is as we go forward with the conservation program, as we conserve more we're going to have some lapses of premiums that we conserved in prior years. But the rates that you see on that schedule of those persistency rates, we think will continue to hold or improve slightly.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Just so I understand it, that if you hadn't done the conservation program, you'd have $38 million less in premium for the year?", "Frank Svoboda", "$38 million less of premium in force, that's right.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "I was hoping we could return to the first question by Jimmy. Can you just, one more time, sort of contrast with respect to American Income, the initiatives at the start of last year with the change in compensation now, how are those two moves different? And again why are you confident, that I know you mentioned you tested, but why are you confident that presumably you tested before, that this time you're going to get the desired outcome? What's the difference and why are you confident?", "Larry Hutchison", "Eric, this is Larry. I'll try to answer that. In 2013, we slightly changed our compensation systems by introducing agent 10-year bonus. We did that in the first quarter and the third quarter of the year. In 2014, we've initiated a revised bonus system that's really aimed at increasing the agent compensation early in agent's career, encouraging greater agent activity. In addition, manager bonus is depended on their recruiting activity and the success of their agents.", "If you think about 2013, we tweak an existing system. In 2014, what we're introducing is a complete revision to our bonus system. When we tweaked the system, we didn't test the same, because it's a slight change and all changes were based on the experience of our leadership and our sales. Before we changed a bonus system throughout the company, we do test the same from six of our offices, from smaller to larger offices, we tested the change in bonus at the agent and manager level and based on those test results, we're confident that we'll see an increase in recruiting activity among the managers and the agents.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "And just to be clear, when you say you tested, is this essentially asking the individuals involved how they would respond?", "Larry Hutchison", "Both. When we test, we take the actual new bonus system and we install that bonus system in the different SGA offices where we're testing the same. So it's a live test with a new bonus system, and then we measure those recruiting, those retention, those activity results with that new bonus system. And we certainly received feedback from the field before we introduced this to field.", "We talked about this with all the SGAs and we talked with the leadership council within the SGA group. So we've tested their response as we showed them the results of the test. We received feedback and we made minor changes based on the feedback. But basically the installation followed a testing of this new bonus system.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "I was just wondering if you could just revisit just one last time here on American Income. Do you think that there might be an issue of competition, because I don't think that that's been the case in the past, but I am just wondering if maybe there has been some ramping up of some of your competitors, maybe in some of your regions, and that could be the cause for the weaker recruiting and retention? So if you could address that? And then I have a follow-up.", "Larry Hutchison", "Actually the issue is not competition. The American Income really doesn't have a competition within their field force, within their sales. As we study the sales, we don't see that we are involved in replacing the policies nor our policy is replaced. When you look at the lack of growth in 2013, this really a result of not increasing our agent counts.", "And the agent count was a result of two things. We had a decline in agent count. We've seen a lower retention of the agents and we did not achieve our recruiting objectives. The two go hand-in-hand. So we think with our new systems as we inspect our existing recruiting systems, we need to increase our recruiting objectives and we want to work on the decline in our actual agent terminations.", "Gary Coleman", "And Joanne, I would add that we feel like as far as retention is narrated, we need to tweak the bonuses to get more money in their hands earlier in order to help them survive their first year, because we know that once they have survived their first year, they'll persist better going forward. And to do that we also had to incentivize the managers to recruit and train more and that's the tweaks that Larry was talking about, tweak to do those two things.", "Larry Hutchison", "I just want to follow-up and say that if you look at the history of the American Income, it's not unusual to see a very strong sales year followed by a slower sales year. And so given the double-digit increase in sales and agent counts in 2012, it's not surprising that we struggled somewhat in 2013. We think about agent growth and the growth of American Income as a bit of a stair step process. And so we're hoping that we've come to the end of the stairs. We're going to step upward this year as we see greater agent recruiting, a better retention within the agency.", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "Yes. I recall your stair step function comments previously. I guess one last follow-up on that, do you think that maybe the recruiting targets haven't been met maybe because the unemployment rate in the U.S. has improved?", "Larry Hutchison", "I don't think so because when Gary and I look across the agency, what we're seeing, there are plenty of resumes that are within those individual agencies. There's no shortage of candidates. It's really an activity, which is having recruits in its office and then turning those recruits into national agents and then returning those agents to their first year. So I don't think unemployment rates really have much of an impact on American Income.", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "And then just a completely separate subject, now that the Family Heritage I guess is kind of up and running, you're still rolling out I guess new offices and stuff, do you see anything on the M&A landscape that could interest you?", "Gary Coleman", "Not at this moment, we continue to look, as we talked about before, we're fairly narrow on our scope. We're looking for companies that are in the middle income market, similar to other companies and that have either captive agencies or direct control distribution. We haven't seen that many candidates recently, but we'll continue to look.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk a little bit about the 8% growth within direct response and maybe the mix of that in terms of what's coming from the new higher face amount policies? And then along the line, is there any changes in kind of the behavior experience you've seen early on with those higher face amount consumers?", "Larry Hutchison", "We are seeing positive results from the higher face amount, the adult products, and all the all of the issued policies about 50,000 are actually still a small percentage of our total net premium. It does drive the increase in our total adult net premium. What I mean by that Christopher is that, if we don't make a $100,000 offer, it may result in their final sale, the people may elect a smaller-face policy. So it's an overall lift to the sales as they cross $100,000 offers. As we look at our test, we expect in 2014, the total we're seeing the same favorable results. So from 2014, we're going to roll out more of those campaigns with a higher face mailings and we have rate adjustments based on those additional test results.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "And any plans to expand the face amount value further to get into additional markets?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, not really. I think what we're looking now is we're comfortable with the face amount, the other initiatives will be testing different rates, different packaging, down to different creative to reach that customer. And other expansion will be internet or electronic media, continue to see our greatest growth there. So we have different campaigns aimed reaching more consumers in that middle income market electronically.", "Gary Coleman", "And Chris although the prescription drug, access to those records have allowed us to do a little more underwriting than we've done in the past. It's helped us to give out from the 50,000 to the 100,000 face amount. In direct response, you really can't do enough underwriting to justify showing face amount above that.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "And then you've targeted kind of overtime 10% growth in agent count in American income. Wondering if that's still a range that you think is achievable and what's the environment that we need to be in to achieve those, maybe both at macro as well micro level?", "Larry Hutchison", "Chris, as a good rule of thumb, our projected agent count growth for 2014 is not that high. We're currently at 5,000 agents. The projected agent count for yearend 2014 is between 5,500 and 5,600 agents.", "Gary Coleman", "That's a 5% to 6% growth.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "In the past you've talked about kind of over time a 10% growth, is that still a level of agent count growth that you think is kind of achievable? And then again, kind of what type of environment do we need to be in to kind of get those agent growth levels?", "Larry Hutchison", "Surely it's achievable and we think we'll achieve that in the future. And we need to se it's certainly in the year and we need to see what the effect these two initiatives will have on agent recruiting with the managers on the agent retention, so as we see the effect of those two initial use, we could get closer to 10%, but right now based on test, best on our best judgment, we think it will be a little lighter for 2014.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "My question is on direct response as well, and it's really more around I think you had mentioned a lower level of DAC amortization, but I don't recall if that was specifically the direct response, but then there was also a comment about the ability to defer some of the internet-related acquisition costs. Could you just help us understand, the net impact of those things, how do we think about that as in terms of the margin, direct response is doing something around 25%, 25.5% margin currently. It looks like that's about two points higher than it was historically. Is that about the right way to think about that?", "Gary Coleman", "John, first of all in the amortization, we've seen slightly lower amortization this year and we think that's due to the improved persistency from the conservation program, but the biggest challenge is the deferral of those internet expenses. I think we talked about this in the second quarter when we made the change under the new accounting rules for deferred acquisition costs that were adopted a couple of years, we had a certain amount of record keeping evidence to show that these costs are leading to direct sales of the policies.", "And we finally were able to demonstrate that early this year and as a result, beginning of the second quarter, we started to deferring those costs. Now, what the impact to that was within 2012, our non-deferred acquisition expenses were 3.3% of premium. This year there is 1.6% of premium. It was due to that fall of those costs. And so we were 23% private margin in 2012, we ended this year right at 25% and we expected to be at that level going forward.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Question on margins, it seems like really the underwriting margins have been the main driver for earnings growth in the foreseeable or in the recent past. Is that story pretty much over or are there other leverage to pull to further improve margins?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, I think there is improved persistency. It helps our amortization. As we talked about, we can continue to improve persistency somewhat. Controlling our non-deferred acquisition costs that we were just talking about gives us some more opportunities, but I don't look for big changes in the margins. Pretty high they are and I don't know that we can increase some great deal.", "Larry Hutchison", "Before you hang up, I would just add Gary that that is, you're right, in 2012, we had a significant initiative as we really changed over to that variable cost model, where we had a big reduction to those non-deferred cost and then as we talked about the internet costs here in 2013. We really don't see significant movements in those non-deferred costs, as we have here those last couple of years.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "And then, switching gears to American Income and headcount there again. I guess I was a little surprised by going for 5% to 6% growth in headcount there given that you're coming out with a new initiative that pretty much is going to impact three full quarter of this year, and not very strong prior year results, so why wouldn't growth year be closer to 10% long-term range?", "Larry Hutchison", "The long-term range, I hope it is closer to 10%, but we just came out from a year in which agent growth was flat. We didn't have that kind of growth. Again, we tested these new initiatives at six offices, but we have 75 American Income offices that we've rolled this out into. And it's just too early to see the results of those initiatives. I think we'll have a better guidance in terms of agency growth at the end of the first quarter and at the second quarter. Again, we think the growth at American Income will be stronger in the third and fourth quarter. Some time in third quarter call, we'll see the real effects of these initiatives, and obviously the sales growth will attract the agent growth.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "I'm not sure whether you touched on this earlier, but could you talk about the Medicare supplement market, kind of how you see that playing out, given healthcare reform and Medicare Advantage of funding that sort of things. What do you think is coming over the next 12 months?", "Larry Hutchison", "Brian, you want to talk about the Medicare Advantage?", "Brian Mitchell", "We are confidently looking at various proposals that are coming about with regards to Medicare reform. It seems like every quarter, couple of trends a year, there are various proposals. The most recent had been put forth by Senate Finance, and those include to consider merging the part A, part B deductible, various reforms to the coverage, but nothing right now is firmed up. That is something that I continue to monitor almost daily.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "And I don't know whether you described sales outlook in that category for 2014. But are there any expectations that you can share?", "Larry Hutchison", "We are seeing strong Medicare supplemental growth in the individual market. This year we had about 20% growth in individual sales. It's harder to predict the group sales, those tend to be a little lumpier in a sense that they either get a large case or you don't, those tend to come in more in the fourth quarter than they do in the first quarter.", "Gary Coleman", "But Mark, overall, I think we're looking for growth somewhere between 10% and 20% as far as the Medicare supplemental sales, as Larry mentioned. The reason for the big range is we're just not sure what the group sales are going to be.", "Frank Svoboda", "And you'd ask about the Medicare Advantage and the Affordable Care Act. There are subsidies that are proposed to be eliminated. I don't know that we've actually seen that play out and what the effect of that is yet to Medicare Advantage.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "Right. But presumably more positive when Medicare Advantage, if it is more restrained perhaps? That will be [multiple speakers].", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.", "Gary Coleman", "All right. Thank you for joining us this morning. Those were our comments.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2013 10-K and any subsequent Form 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "", "Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Net operating income for the first quarter was $137 million or $1.52 per share, a per share increase of 9% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $133 million or $1.48 per share, 17% increase on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of March 31 was 15.5% and our book value per share was $39.68, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $46.85, a 2% increase.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $489 million and life underwriting margins increased 6% to $141 million. The growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth due to lower amortization on our deferred acquisition cost and the deferral of certain direct response Internet acquisitions cost that had not been deferred prior to the second quarter of 2013. ", "The lower amortization rate is a result of improvements and persistency attributable to our ongoing conservation program and is incorporated in our guidance. For full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase approximately 3% to 5% over 2013. The growth rate for the year will be less than the first quarter growth rate primarily because the direct response Internet cost will be on a comparable basis for the remainder of the year. ", "Net life sales were $89 million, up 5% compared to first quarter of last year and up 7% over the fourth quarter of 2013.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 1% to $219 million and health underwriting margins declined 1% to $49 million. For the full year we expect health underwriting margin to decline from 2% to 4%. Health sales increased 34% to $32 million due primarily to the increase in group Medicare supplement sales.", "Administrative expenses were $44 million for the quarter, 1% more than a year ago. For the full year we anticipate that administrative expenses will be up around 1% and be approximately 5.7% of premium. ", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison ", "Thank you, Gary. Before we get into the market operations, I would like to point out that the agent count information on our website now includes an average agent count for the first quarter of 2014, in addition to the quarter end counts we have historically provided. Due to significant fluctuation that can occur from week to week, we believe that adding an average agent count for the quarter will provide more meaningful information regarding agent trends. ", "Now let's look at the results of our marketing operations for the first quarter. First, let's discuss Direct Response which generates approximately 35% of our life premiums. We are pleased with the Direct Response results. Life premiums were up 6% to $178 million and life underwriting margin increased 15% to $45 million. Net life sales were up 9% to $40 million. We are continuing to see significant production growth generated by our lower rates adult insurance offerings and electronic media. We expect life sales growth for the full year 2014 to be in the range of 6% to 9%. ", "Now American Income which generates approximately 38% of our life premiums; American Income's life premiums were up 7% to $186 million and life underwriting margin was up 7% to $60 million. Net life sales increased 1% for the quarter to $38 million. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 5,500, down 2% from a year ago, but up 4% during the quarter. The average agent count for the first quarter was 5,298. On our last call, we indicated that we expect the sales to be flat for the first half of the year and then ramp up in the second half as changes in the compensation system kicked in. Despite significant weather related difficulties around the country, life sales increased slightly. We believe the changes implemented early in 2014 began to have a positive impact during the first quarter. We are seeing improvement in the percentage of agent submitting business and the average premium per application. While the average agent count for the quarter was lower than the count at the end of the fourth quarter we saw strong and steady growth during March. While it is still early we believe that agent retention will be positively impacted by the compensation changes. We opened a new office in the first quarter and we plan to open five more during the remainder of the year. We expect that life sales growth for the full year of 2014 to be within a range of 3% to 6% with most of the growth coming in the third and fourth quarters. ", "Now, Liberty National. At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $69 million. Our life underwriting margin declined 10% to $17 million. Net life sales grew 4% to $7 million; our net health sales increased 25% to $4 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,451, up 6% from a year ago and up 1% during the quarter. The average agent count for the full quarter was 1,400, while this is lower than the count at the end of 2013 we saw a steady increase to the last half of the quarter. The first quarter sales increases were higher than we had anticipated due obviously to improvements in agent productivity and activity levels.

Health premiums increased 7% to $49 million, our health underwriting margin increased 16% to $11 million, and health net sales declined 8% to $10 million. The agent count also declined during the first quarter. We believe these disappointing results were due in large part to weather related issues that affected Family Heritage to a greater extent than other distribution channels. On a positive note, we saw improvements in agent counts throughout March and we are seeing positive sales momentum during March and April. We still expect growth in health sales of Family Heritage for the full year of 2014 to be in the range of 2% to 6%. ", "Now, United American General Agency, health premiums grew 1% to $78 million in our General Agency; net health sales grew 116% to $14 million. The increase is due primarily to a large group Medicare supplement case; we also continue to see strong growth with our individual Medicare supplement sales. Although it is difficult to project Medicare group Medicare supplement sales activity, our guidance for the full year assumes General Agency net health sales growth of approximately 25% to 35%. ", "Medicare Part D. Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 8% to $83 million while the underwriting margin grew 19% to $10 million. Currently sales for the quarter were $31 million compared to $9 million in the year ago quarter due to the increase on low income, subsidized enrollees for 2014 and a large employer group case.

Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $57 million, an increase of $1 million or 2% over the first quarter of 2013. On a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 7%.", "For the full year, we expect excess investment income to increase by about 4% to 6%. On a per share basis, the increase should be about 9% to 11% compared to 2013. The growth rate expected for the full year 2014 is higher than that of the first quarter so the excess investment income in the first quarter of 2013 was the highest of any quarter in 2013 due to the impact of [calls of] [ph] higher yielding securities during the first and second quarters.

Overall the total portfolio is rated A minus same as a year ago.", "In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1 billion compared to $390 million at the end of the fourth quarter.

So far in April, we have used $33 million to purchase another 427,000 shares.

In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2014. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2014 to be around $380 million. Thus including the $60 million available from assets on hand as of the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $440 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.

We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company. ", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiary. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis.

Please go ahead.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning. Just had a couple of questions. First, Larry you mentioned weather a couple of times. So maybe talk about if you did see an impact on your sale? Any delay for health or direct response from weather and whether that affected recruiting as well? And then secondly on the agent count, you saw a nice entries at American Income but if I look over the past couple of years your agent count in the first quarter increased a decent amount I think up 17% in the first quarter of 2012, 8% in the first quarter of 2013 and then last year it actually declined in the other quarter. So are there seasonality and what your expectations are for the agent count at American Income through the rest of the year? ", "Larry Hutchison", "For Liberty National and for American Income, the severe weather did have a slight negative impact on both sales and recruiting. And at Family Heritage, the agencies were primarily in rural areas for a majority of the sales involved travel of large distances to market the product, it was challenging to overcome the setbacks and in addition at Family Heritage the inclement weather coincided with the company's major sales incentive weeks. With respect to the agent retention, we are not expecting a drop in agent retention at American Income later this year. We believe we will continue to see the positive impact from the changes and compensation we introduced in January, we will have better information regarding agent retention trends later in the summer. Well, primarily we are seeing three positive trends in agent productivity at American Income. Our total bonus earners increased in the first quarter, [the signs] [ph] of agents submitting new business on weekly basis increased, and the average premiums submitted also increased. Those three indicators would tell us that we believe our retention is going to better over the next quarter and through the remainder of the year. ", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And with Direct Response, any disruption or any effect on your sales with the disruption in mail delivery and stuff over -- and actually at Liberty and American Income, have you seen better trends in April as the weather has gotten a little better or not? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "We are seeing the same trends in April at American Income and Liberty. Direct Response is also affected by the bad weather particularly in the insert media, now some of the delivery of the insert media was delayed and that's lost because when you have bad weather, when the next mailing goes out it\u2019s on top of the first mailing, but at the go get Direct Response had a strong first quarter and so they had fairly minor impact upon the Direct Response operation. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Eric Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could discuss current trends in the med sub business a little bit more. Are you seeing any pickup in demand for individual policies or any increase in disenrollment from Med Advantage at this point? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "The Medicare Advantage disenrollment did not have a major impact upon the company. It was our estimate that in the first quarter, our production increased by approximately 10% to 15% because of Medicare disenrollment. The growth we are seeing in 2014 in the general agency really comes from the individual sales which is a result of strong recruiting and its implementation of new e-application and the group Medicare supplement we benefited from a the large case within the first quarter and that business tends to be little bit lumpy. We are hopeful of seeing more large cases during the year. But our guidance does not reflect that. ", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Okay, and maybe what are some of the dynamics in the group market in terms of competition or its margin trends in that business? Do you have had some relative good sales in recent periods? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "This is lumpy, it is a competitive market. And they are continually holding different large group cases and medium group cases. If we price to a profit margin and we either receive the business or we do not receive the business. ", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Okay, and then just one on Part D. You had pretty strong margins there. Can you remind us whether you are expecting or what's assumed in guidance for Part D margins for the year and should we expect that they can hold up at first quarter level?

First on Liberty National's margins which I noticed were off a little bit this quarter. And seemed to be a little -- going maybe the wrong direction certainly relative to other segments. So I was curious just to what was causing that and if you thought that would correct itself as the year progresses? ", "Gary Coleman", "Well, the impact of - the first quarter was really in a decline so we had higher claims in the first quarter. And also the claims for the first quarter of last year were little bit low. At Liberty the claims are high in the first half of the year than it\u2019s - higher than they are in the second half, and it just so happen that is the first quarter was high - this year last year the second was over 40%, as a percentage of policy obligation, so it's little bit of seasonality here, for the year though we expect the policy obligation at Liberty be around 38% to 39% and that's compared to a little over 38% for the last year. ", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then on the excess investment income side. With yields pulling back a little bit kind of beginning of the year, are you still comfortable with the initial guidance you gave for the full year I think it was 5% to 7% growth?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I feel comfortable with the guidance we gave earlier. We did lower though our new money rate from 5.5 to 5.25. 5.5 is what we used in our previous guidance. As we have seen that market rates decline somewhat, though we feel confident that we can hit the prior quarter and at that -- again we will see increase in growth as year goes on.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And if I could just may be a quick numbers question something I missed. Larry, I think you talked about 25% or 35% sales growth guidance for the year. I missed through, what segment that was? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "That's for the United American General agency; we said health sales from the United American Independent Agency to be up approximately 25% to 35%, group count Medicare supplement sales we said to be up about 35%.

I guess first I want to follow up on the med sub discussion. So you have a pretty good outlook for the year. It sounds like there were a lot of dissimilarities in med advantage but I am just curious is the competition increasing in med sub just based on this idea that med advantage funding pressures could go on over time? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I think med sub is really market if you look at the demographics certainly there are many people turning 65, so we are growing market over time. Our sales really are depended upon assumption of any disenrollment from Medicare advantage. What we are focusing on these recruiting agents to sell Medicare supplement business and we have implemented a new e-application system to makes easier for the agents to write the business to United American Insurance Company, so their growth is really driven here by strong agent recruiting and e-application process. ", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Okay, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment over the last year or so? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I think it is really the same environment, as I said we saw net increase disenrollments in the first quarter. As we look at the replacement forms is our estimate that those first quarter Medicare this Medicare advantage disenrollment led to an increase in production of about 10% to 15%. ", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Okay and then I just have a couple of quick weather related one. You noted a little bit higher claims at Liberty which I know is typical of the first quarter from a seasonal perspective but wondering if you thought the bad weather had caused any uptick in mortality rates in the first quarter. ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I don't think the bad weather affected the mortality rate. And Gary said about the seasonal pattern, as we looked back at Liberty over the many years the claims tend to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. ", "Gary Coleman", "If you may be the first quarter so our -- and may be second quarter it was last year but I don't think there is anything surprising here. ", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Okay and then just last one on Family Heritage, the sales weakness from the weather. And do you think that uniquely impacted that business because of its rural focus? So do you think that was more of an industry issue for kind of all supplemental health --? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I think uniquely affected Family Heritage. Again most of our agency forces for Liberty and typically for American Income in urban areas. And Family Heritage, those agencies were primarily at rural areas as for the sales force travel long distances to market products, given the bad weather in the upper Midwest and the East and even the South, it really had a negative impact upon Family Heritage. In addition, the Family Heritage, they have major incentive weeks and it so happen that the bad weather coincided with several of those major sales incentive weeks. So the impact was greater at Family Heritage and other two agencies. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much, good morning. I guess first question is just over the past several years. We've heard from several competitors the talk about moving down market. Maybe not all the way down to your target customer were met suddenly, rolled out its partnership with Wal-Mart in some states, others are seemingly working with -- we looks like another big box in department store, retailers as customers seemed to be more willing to purchase through retail channels. So wondering if you are seeing any signs of increased competition or any comments you can make around those strategies and impact it could have on your distribution? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "If you look at our Direct Response operation and we also looked for the each of the agency operations and we have not seen any evidence of increased competition that field in our direct marketing. ", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, any comments just in terms of may be that direct through kind of the retail distribution versus mail or internet? ", "Larry Hutchison", "Oh, quite a chance of a product that doesn't sell itself, they need to sold to an agency so we believe in the agency system but we think we have had great success with Direct Response in all three channels, in Direct Response, through the direct mail, the electronic media, fastest growing segment is electronic media. And part of the reason I can see we are not seeing an increased competition, if you look at the electronic media in the first quarter; our inquiries were up 40% compared to same period a year ago. And we don't think that will continue for the full year, we are expecting electronic media inquiries to be up at least 20% for the full year. And so electronic air and electronic media as we focus on different areas. We are comfortable that globe will continue to grow and it supports the other two segments, other two channels in its distribution. ", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and then last question. Just wanted to get some perspective in terms of sort of how much runway you think you have with the higher face amount policies you guys are telling selling direct. ", "Larry Hutchison ", "Before answering (inaudible) it is an excellent question, the actual numbers of course the issue is higher face amount has increased , by offering the higher face amount we are also seeing even bigger increase and policies issue across all policy face amount. So we are continuing to explore higher face amount, what we are finding it that helps our sales and the other smaller face amounts that remains more offer, that we really rolled out in the third and fourth quarter different rates and different real products with testing started all products now sometime at runway, we will try to addressing that in the third and fourth quarter that we are seeing result of those additional tests. ", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", " ", "And when you talked about test, are you talking geographically even exploring further increases in the face amount or both?", "Larry Hutchison ", "It is geographic, it is different packaging, it is different writers doing -- there is lot of different testing we do with these all products. ", "Gary Coleman", "We have talked about in the past digital $30,000 maximum face amount, so we have increased that up to around $100,000, if your question is, are we going to further up from $100,000, that's I am not sure that happens, it is little bit hard in Direct Response because we can't do greater deal of underwriting, it would be difficult to go higher face amount than that. ", "Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Understood, great, thanks, appreciate the comments. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.", "Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners", "Hi, good morning. Broader question on Family Heritage. You did talk about weather impact in the quarter and expecting a better March and April, you've also talked about in the past improving some of the kind of recruitment tools of that business but I guess what I am really curious about is if you look at a level of sales and if you look at the level of recruiting generally, I assume it is probably been a little disappointing and I am just curious to how you think about the performance of that business broadly relative to how you originally thought about it when you bought it? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I don't think it has been disappointing. I think we made some adjustments in the system from recruiting last year. So you look at this year, year-to-date it was disappointed first quarter because it was hit by the bad weather, if you go to the second quarter we are seeing some positive indicators for both recruiting and sales. Our sales projections for 2014 are in range of 2% to 6%. We think the agent count at the end of the year for 2014 in a range of 600 to 725 agents. Now the growth at Family Heritage is going to come from the increased in the sales force. And so that's our focus and we believe that it is sales force grows and significant growth in production follows that sales growth. ", "Gary Coleman", "Mark, it is really-- it is the case when we bought the company, we knew we are going to-- there will be significant changes made to the way recruiting was done, we expected this would take a little time to because they may (inaudible) jumping on, so we are not disappointed with it, we excepted this time, as a matter of fact it will be little air space.", "Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follows up on the American Income agent count. You had a very strong first year improvement but you did see a little bit of fall off in renew year. Is that just fluctuation or anything else going on there? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I think the fall off is an indication of the retention issues we had over the last 15 to 18 months. As we see better retention first year agents would expect to see in the third, fourth quarter, and those veteran agents numbers will grow. When you think about it, in any quarter you are going to loose certain veteran agents. If you are not adding new agents that entered that 13 month that number will be flat or slightly drop.", "Gary Coleman", "Mark, on price I think that the -- when you look at total agent count and the management count is pretty much flat of last year but the growth is come in the writing agents, that's a good indicator because as we grow the number of agents, writing agents, that is the ones who will go into management so we think that's leading indicator that we will see increase in management as well.

Frank, I think you typically talked about how you expect yield I mean you said that the yield should be about 5.9% for the year on average. But how should that develop quarterly? Could you give us that? ", "Frank Svoboda ", "Yes. I think it drops towards 592 for the first quarter and we really think dropping probably just 1% to 2% basis point sequentially over the course of the quarters.

Exchanges, group-- probably a bit overwrought all the discussion about exchanges with regards to active employees but it definitely seems to be making headway in the retiree market. Given the big group sale you made any, does United American plan that, are you on these exchanges through the agencies, does this affect you at all?

I have a general question about the health business and then a narrow one about the health business. My first question is as follows, it feels like it wasn't terribly long ago say within the last one to two years-- that two years ago that the health business was well in decline and with premiums falling sharply and now they are falling a lot less sharply, indeed they were essentially flat. It seemed back then at least to me that Torchmark was heading towards becoming overwhelmingly a life company and much less of a health company than it had been in the past. My question is as we look forward given the strength that you are enjoying now in Medicare supplement and elsewhere in health insurance, do you anticipate - is the health business turning around really is what I am asking and do you anticipate a more balanced mixed between life and health perspectively and then what you would have said a year ago? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I guess if you remember if you look at 2010, 2011 and 2012, the decline you saw in health line were largely the result of the larger block of business that we wrote, it would have been subject to the Healthcare Reform Act, we decided to exit that line of business in 2010, as you see (inaudible) client, I think what you are seeing is a stabilization our healthcare business because a large part of America supplement business is growing in individual and also growing in a group. Long term, our focus remained on life insurance, we certainly like the health insurance business, we find the life insurance business to be more predictable and so vis-\u00e0-vis is sales growth and it is easy to maintain and captive agency force in a life insurance business than is in the health insurance business. ", "Gary Coleman", "I would agree with Larry. We do prefer the life business because normally the high margin and that's where our excess investment income come from, I think there is a point also in the niche that we have in the health insurance side. But for example this year we look at the premium income being flat, that's actually an improvement over the years you talked about Larry but we expect to see some growth there but it is not going be such growth that it has on life side and that's staying with us.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets ", "My second question is similar but more focused and it is focused on the Medicare Part D business. Again, my -- if my memory shows me correctly when Medicare Part D first began several years ago, you had a burst of business and then there was sort of uncertainty as to whether this drug related business, drug insurance related business would continue at the pace that it had been. It was suggested that it might pulled out sharply and now it seems to have stabilized. My question, do you see Medicare Part D remaining a meaningful growing, a meaningful and growing part of the business? ", "Gary Coleman", "I think where we stand now I think it is a meaningful part of our businesses but to say whether it is going to grow or how big is it going to be in the future is difficult because it is such competitive market. In addition to that, there is a difference between the order of time market and non auto zone market, there are different levels there, uncertainty there and also when you take a look at it we like the business but the profit margin there is lower than say it is on our health business and life business. So it is less more competitive, it is lower margin. We are glad to have the business but it is hard to predict in the future how big it will be or it will be -- even it will be there.", "Larry Hutchison ", "In fact as Gary said we look at Part D, it is an opportunistic market, every year we have been to achieve our target profit margins, every year we are going to gain regions or we are going to loose regions. Now currently we have about 20 to 25 regions and 35 possible regions. We hope to maintain that level of regions but competitors decide about the business and we could loose regions in that competitive business, if the auto assign market becomes extremely competitive, we could lose most our auto assigns but we still have our regular market, group market to rely on.

And we over the years we have-- the share repurchase have outweighed our dividends that this last year saw the first year we really hit at our share price, is gotten close to what we think intrinsic value and so that's how we mention the possibility of special dividend and that would be something we would have to discuss with our Board about but absent of an acquisition or absence of other cash we provided at the strong return to shareholders we would consider that if we felt we needed to send share repurchase because of valuation, but we are not there yet and we forget about this share repurchase to the first quarter but as you said we have another 30% increase in share price that we still not expect but we did -- we don't want to -- we recognize the fact that we buyback the shares at prices -- we can't just buy and just buy for the shareholders, so that's what we have to conversation about the special dividend, it has been possibility. ", "Bob Glasspiegel - Jenny Capital", "I applaud your logic and it is very sound and so you are somewhere in between closing not near the point where you would consider it, I guess that was the bare that was the sort of rough -- ", "Gary Coleman", "From a historical standpoint we are closer to the intrinsic day or what we feel the value of stock is than we have been in past years. But we don't -- we are not close enough that we think we should suspend the repurchase.", "Larry Hutchison ", "And it is not fixed point It is an ongoing analysis, we look at that every quarter, discuss that with our board of directors and again we will make a decision we think is in the best interest of the shareholders. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "Yes, most of my questions have been answered but I just want to go back to Medicare income for a minute because you quoted some metrics in the Q&A regarding the fact that bonuses were up and the weekly submission were up as well as total submission and I am wondering if you could give us a little bit of feel as to how that spread out through the quarter and if you think that all of the changes that you have made are really starting to hit the stride now or if there is still kind of on the cost. Thanks. ", "Larry Hutchison ", "We have better sales in the first quarter than we expected, we had American Income Life insurance company and that should be driven by the percentage of agency new business on repay basis, we didn't really see the increase in the agents until about mid February. We are seeing positive trends with a new competition program, from mid February on not just new current agents; we are seeing the number of recruits and positive trends. It is little bit early to see what the effect of that new compensation system is going to be. I think it will be probably mid July, probably August and we have enough data from January, February and March that we can look at their third, fourth, fifth month retention to see the real effect of that is having. ", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "Okay, great, then I will check out on that front, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "We have a follow up question from the line of Mark Hughes, please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "Thank you. How much of the Globe Life inquiry volume or new policy volume is coming by electronic media? ", "Larry Hutchison ", "I think we asked, I am trying to understand question, you are asking the four percentage of the Direct Response sales come from electronic media. ", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", " ", "Exactly.", "Larry Hutchison ", "That's 40% of our sales comes from electronic media and that will be in multi media, I am including incoming total calls, the internet, social medium, mobile search ads. Mark, it is hard to give an exact percentage because as we have more of electronic internet traffic, we see a greater presence for social media and also supports our Direct Response and answer media operations for -- so they three work in tandem but we will give rough estimate of about 20% of new sales come from electronic media. ", "Operator", "I'm showing no further questions at this time. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Major for closing remarks. ", "Mike Majors", "All right, thank you for joining us this morning. Those were our comments. And we will talk you again next quarter.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2013 10-K and any subsequent Form 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you Mike, good morning everyone. Please note that the share and per share information in our comments this morning has been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split that was effective on July 1st.", "Net operating income for the second quarter was $136 million or $1.02 per share, a per share increase of 7% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.98 per share, a 2% increase on a per share basis.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of June 30 was 15.4% and our book value per share was $27.02, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share increased 24% to $33.93.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $492 million and life underwriting margins increased 4% to $141 million. Life sales increased 11% to $102 million. For the full year we expect the dollar amount of our life underwriting margins to increase around 3% to 4%.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 1% to $215 million and health underwriting margin also declined 1% to $50 million. Health filed increased 21% to $29 million and the full year we expect the dollar amount of our health margins to be about end of last year.", "Administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter 3% more than a year ago. For the full year, we anticipate that administrative expenses will be around 1% and be approximately 5.7% of premiums. ", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. I would first like to discuss American income. An American income life premium was about 7% $190 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $60 million. Net life sales were $45 million up 9% to primarily to increase agent counts and the higher percentage of agent submitting business, that producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 5,890 up 6% from the year ago.", "The average agent count for the second quarter was 5,744 up 8% from the first quarter. We expect 8% to 11% life sales growth for the full year 2014 now direct response and have direct response operation on the life premium 5% to $177 million and life underwriting margin increased to 2% to $44 million. Net life sales were up 12% to $44 million. We expect 8% to 10% life sales growth for the full year 2014.", "Liberty National, at Liberty National life premiums declined 2% to $68 million and life underwriting margin increased 6% to $18 million. Net life sales grew 7% to $9 million and net health sales increased 22% to $4 million.", "The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,500 up 17% from the year ago. The average agent count for the second quarter was 1,492 up 7% from the first quarter. For the full year 2014, sales growth is expected to be 4% to 6% for life and 12% to 14% for health.", "Now, Family Heritage. Health premiums increased 7% to $51 million; our health underwriting margin increased 13% to $10 million. Health net sales were up 15% to $13 million, the producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 771 up 4% over a year ago. The average agent count for the quarter was 758 up 15% from the first quarter. We expect sales growth for the full year 2014 to be in the range from 3% to 8%.", "Now, the United American General Agency, health premiums declined over 1% to $76 million, net health sales improved 34% to $9 million, of the Group Medicare supplement business is somewhat hard to predict. We expect general agency net sales growth for the full year 2014 to be in a range of approximately 25% to 35%. Medicare Part D, premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 16% to $85 million and the underwriting margin increased to 6% to $9 million. The growth in underlying margin lagged behind premium growth due to the higher claims related to newly approved hepatitis C drugs. As a result we now expect Part D margin for the year to be in range of 8% to 11% rather than the 10% to 13% that was expected earlier in the year. R&D sales for quarter were $20 million up from $8 million a year ago.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "", "Thanks Larry. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $57 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 4% over the second quarter of 2013. On a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment in income increased 10%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to increase by about 3% to 5%. On a per share basis, the increase should be about 8% to 10% compared to 2013.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio. Invested assets were $13.2 billion including $12.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $12.1 billion are investment grade with an average grade of A minus. And below investment grade bonds were $563 million compared to $585 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4% down from 4.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.5 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 16%. Overall the total portfolio is rated A minus same as a year ago.", "In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion compared to $1 billion at the end of the first quarter. The increase in unrealized gains is due primarily to the recent decline in market interest rates.", "As to investment yields, in the second quarter we invested $167 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 5.7% and average rating of BBB at an average life of 21 years. While the BBB average rating is lower than the A-, BBB+ average recent years, the weighted average was just below BBB+. We haven\u2019t changed our philosophy regarding credit quality the investment grade bonds we purchased in the quarter we had our long standing credit criteria.", "The new money raise for the first quarter and second quarter for 5.4% and 4.7% respectively, the mid-point of our guidance assumes a new money rate of 5% for the remainder of 2014. For the entire portfolio the second quarter yields was 5.92% same as the first quarter of 2014 but down 3 basis points from the 5.95% yield in the second quarter of 2013. For the full year, we expect the portfolio to yield approximately 5.90%. And I would add, while we were benefited from higher new money rates, we\u2019re confident that we can have sustained growth in investment income in the current rate environment.", "Now we\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Thanks Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. First regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the second quarter, we spent $82.2 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $52.86. For the full year through today, we had spent $210.1 million of parent company cash to acquire 4 million shares at an average price of $51.95.", "The parent started the year with liquid assets of $60 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2014. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from subsidiaries plus the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "We expect free cash flow in 2014 to be around $380 million. Thus including the $60 million available from assets on hand as of the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $440 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.", "As previously noted to date in 2014, we have used $210 million to purchase Torchmark shares leaving around $230 million of cash available for the remainder of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible as for the better alternatives and if market conditions are favorable, we expect the share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those spend. We also expect to retain a pricing $50 to $60 of liquid assets as the parent company.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiary. As stated in our previous call we have maintained our insurance company capital level at or above an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis which has historically been sufficient to maintain our ratings. This RBC ratio is lower than some peer companies, but has been sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our assets and policy liability.", "At December 31, 2013, our consolidated RBC was 341% we deny currently anticipate any significant changes to a target RBC levels in 2014.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2014, we expect our net operating income will be within range of $4.05 per share to $4.15 per share to mid of $4.10 is $.30 lower than projected earlier in the year due primarily to the impact of higher Part D claims on underwriting and investment income. Those are our comments. We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-answer session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take the first question from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "", "Hi. Thank you. Just had a couple of questions on Part D. First, is it correct to assume that you're reflecting the higher drug costs related to the hepatitis C treatment in your pricing submissions for 2015? So therefore, should we think of this issue being only a meaningful drag on margins in 2014 and that your target margins would revert to the level you had guided to earlier in the year for 2015? ", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, Eric for hepatitis C drug was included in our 2015 pricing", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Okay. So would you -- you had guided to 10% to 13% margins for part D earlier in the year. So is that a reasonable range to think about for 2015 at this point?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Erik I would say you look back historically, we\u2019ve been in around 10% to 11% I think for sure is 10% to 11% it could be 10% to 13%, we still don\u2019t know although we submitted our bids we still don\u2019t know how they relate to others as how many lower income we will get. So I think you\u2019re safe around 10% to 11%.", "Larry Hutchison", "", "Right, we\u2019ll receive those results in August and I want to give guidance on three quarter call.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you, and then one last thing to clarify. You mentioned the cash-flow timing issues being -- pressing investment income a little bit, because you have to pay the claims before you get reimbursed by the government. Does that have any impact on your expected cash flow to the holding Company?", "Frank Svoboda", "Eric this is Frank Svoboda. That will have a little bit of impact on the timing of the cash flow to the wholly commitment to the fact that again reduce some of our investment income. When you look at -- we anticipate for the full year 2014 that will probably incur somewhere in the range $45 to $60 million worth of additional claims, now the majority of that and maybe around 85% of that will be reimbursement CMS as you noted we don\u2019t give reimburse from that until sometime in 2015 so we\u2019ll have that drag, we\u2019ll see the drag on investment income here in 2014 of course that last our investment income on 2014 now there is like capital for statutory earning.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Got it, but in terms of the cash flow to the holding Company, your guidance for the year of the $380 million or so, that's unaffected.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Correct.", "Erik Bass - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gary Coleman", "", "Erik I would add it\u2019s not the $50 million to $60 million, it\u2019s going to impact the cash flow to the holding company, its investment income on that $56 million to [Indiscernible] or whatever of investment income impact while we can do next year. So won\u2019t have an impact on 2014 free cash flow or beyond 2015 free cash flow.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Randy Binner with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Thank you. I have a question about sales seasonality for life insurance and first of all I think that we\u2019ve seen a pattern for at least the last few years were the second quarter has better sales across the board for Life, but American Income might be a little bit better in the second quarter. So the first part of my question is to confirm that that is something we should rely upon in the future and what is the cause of the better sales in the second versus the third quarter, generally speaking? ", "Gary Coleman", "", "Randy I think is truly generally for the year, better agent activity, which is a higher percentage of submitting agents in the second quarter and the third quarter. If you look at American Income, we believe the increase of sales as a result of better recruiting and improved agent retention and the increase in agent activity.", "Larry Hutchison", "I would assume great response traditionally in second quarter has been a little bit higher than the first quarter.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Can you remind us as of why -- what is it about the second quarter that is better?", "Gary Coleman", "One thing the second quarter your circulation is higher -- first quarter your circulation typically is little bit lower to the fourth quarter; there is some seasonality to that. So that would result in with the lag in sales of circulation, you\u2019d see a mid-year increase in sales versus the beginning of the first quarter in direct response.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "So its mail issues in Direct, and then for AIA, it's just people are more receptive to buying in the second versus the latter part of the year of the first quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "The people are more receptive, I think it\u2019s only expanding the agencies. We\u2019re active on recruiting, and with those new recruits you have a higher activity level, you have more submitting agents into the middle of the first quarter to the second quarter and the third quarter. Usually the agent recruiting is strong in the fourth quarter.", "Larry Hutchison", "I think in part both sides of the industry is showing a great response. There is lots of activity around the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holiday. And the activity first picking up in the first quarter is higher is going to the later part of the year.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay. And that's helpful. And then just focusing on AIA, I think that explains why productivity peaks in the second quarter. So as far as AIA goes, this is a good sales result. There's not a lower comp, but it seems like it's turned the corner a little bit. So would be interested in your commentary. You mentioned you have a lot of recruiting efforts. I think you have technology efforts through CRM and laptop presentations and that kind of stuff. I'd be interested in what's working and what the follow through you think is on the momentum you've been able to build here at AIA.", "Gary Coleman", "I think the agency force of American Income has responded well to the changes we made in both our compensation and recruiting system. We don\u2019t expect to see momentum drop significantly. I don\u2019t think the agent count will increase this quickly as we did in the second quarter. But I think we continue to see increases in agent count to the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year.", "Larry Hutchison", "We\u2019ve seen improvement in recruiting but also we\u2019ve seen net increase in activity level. I know the words percentage of agents that we have that are submitting business. One thing we\u2019ve talked about in the past is we\u2019re working on retention and we\u2019ve seen some impact types of retention, although we need to do more there. But I think for the second quarter is not increase in agent count but it also improved activity levels of the agents.", "Gary Coleman", "I think the other two factors the American Income; we really haven\u2019t seen a change in agent productivity. That\u2019s a project sign; we keep in mind how many new agents were there at American Income. We have good result; that we\u2019re seeing at American Income is the increase in that middle management count. The middle management counts grown about 10% since January 1st and middle management is really who trains the new agents in the field? So it\u2019s a very positive development at American Income.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Sales managers you said were up 10% in the first half on the quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "The first half of 2014 our middle management count at American Income was increased.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Sarah DeWitt with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays", "", "Hi. Good morning. The 8% to 11% outlook for Life net sales growth this year is a very strong result. If we look out a bit longer term, do you think high single-digit; low double-digit sales growth is sustainable? And what would be the biggest driver that? Is that mostly just growing the agent count?", "Gary Coleman", "The biggest driver is driving the agent count and it\u2019s also having a correct train system to keep your activity levels at levels that they are in the second quarter and we expect to be in the third quarter. Now for 2015 such guidance we\u2019ll give on the next call, it\u2019s a little early to give 2015 guidance. I would say generally with Direct Response that feature the agencies, results we saw in the second quarter are certainly sustainable through the end of the year.", "Sarah DeWitt - Barclays", "Okay. Great. And then secondly, the guidance you gave for the life underwriting margin to grow 3% to 4% this year, that's slightly down from the 3% to 5% you said before, and I think you were at about 5% year to date. So what's driving that slight decline?", "Gary Coleman", "Sarah we have a little bit higher declines than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. But we\u2019re still probably down I think for our margin, under-writing margin for this year is around 28.7, we\u2019re expecting it to be 28%, 29% for the year. But it\u2019s not a big change.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "Good morning, everybody. I look at the extra investment income guidance, and I think that's dropped slightly from the last guidance. And want to make sure; is that just by virtue of the new money rate having dropped a little bit? Or is there also a lower expectation of assets -- asset growth?", "", "Gary Coleman", "The effective new money rate is more minor factor, at the midpoint of our guidance our excess investment income is about $1 million less than it was previously, less than $1 million of that is from having ordinary money rate but over 1.3 million that is the impact of the cash flow as in Part D we talked about earlier, it is the remainder if the other cash flow timing of those cash flow, but it\u2019s more something we might right add as the impact of the Part D that cause us to change the guidance.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "That makes sense. And then I'm sorry if I missed that, but did you -- when you talked about the new guidance for excess investment income, did you say what the new money rate target or guidance was for the full year?", "Gary Coleman", "", "For the remainder of the year the guidance, the midpoint of guidance we use 5.0%.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. And that seems to have dropped a bit more radically than at least what I seem to be seeing in the 30-year treasury rates, at least over the last quarter. Has anything else happened there?", "Gary Coleman ", "", "No, I\u2019m not sure but we\u2019ve seen out in the market the year is all lower, the treasury rates have dropped and the credit spreads have offset rates, I think we dropped the 2.4% yield in the second quarter and we do think it\u2019s going to get better in remainder of the year we started almost. So we think we can do at least 5% there we have the midpoint.", "Operator", "", "And the next question comes from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks so much. Good morning. A few follow-up questions on part D. My understanding is 47 states' Medicaid agencies are covering the hepatitis C drug, and wondering how much of your business comes from those 3 states that aren't covering it? And how should we think about future or potential risks to the margin, either up or downside?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Chris this is Frank. I don\u2019t have in front of me the actual number of states that we have where the state Medicaid is covering that I know that we\u2019ve lost we\u2019ve had some disenrollees with respect to both California and Illinois. So to the extent that there are some of family members that are having hepatitis C there that may help us to some degree. But I don\u2019t really have that information with me.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And then, the repricing or pricing that you\u2019re doing for the 2015 enrollment, you note that reflects the high cost of that hepatitis C drug. Just wondering if in that pricing you\u2019re fully reflecting the current Gilead product, or are you assuming that the cost could go even higher if they\u2019re successful in kind of getting the approval, kind of the companion hep C drug? ", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, when we\u2019re reflecting the best information we had today and what that pricing would be on our best estimate on utilization using our experience then competition the course of our consultant and what that pricing would be, and that pricing would include to the extent that there is a new drug that was come up and replace Sovaldi or -- the pricing will take into account that replacement type of a drug.", "Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. And within your pricing for \u201814, any sense of if or what was embedded within that, if anything?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, for \u201814 pricing we really did not include anything specifically for either one of these two new drugs. We always include some type of an allowance and claim strength margin if you will from new drugs it will be they are in the pipeline or that will come up but the allowance that was built in here for 2014 was nothing would have accommodated the high price that\u2019s associated with these new drugs.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Yes. Hey. Good morning, everybody. To follow-up on the hep C drugs and make sure I got the right numbers here, were you -- I think it was Gary. Gary, were you suggesting that the amount of total spend on these drugs would be $60 million for the year? And of course on a GAAP basis, you would recognize the reinsurance from the government, so it would be $45 million coming back, so the net FX would be $15 million, but the cash outflow would actually be $65 million, $60 million, $65 million?", "Gary Coleman ", "Frank why don\u2019t you comment on this.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "The total outlay that we\u2019re estimating at this point in time is around $45 million to $60 million. And we\u2019re anticipating it\u2019s going to be getting back from TMS, their share of those total claims to be somewhere in that $43 million to $50 million range. So we\u2019re anticipating that our impact on underwriting income for the full year will be somewhere in the range of $7 million to $10 million.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Frank, how much has already been spent in the total outlay for this?", "Frank Svoboda", "Through June 30th, the total outlay is about $24.5 million of which our share was about $4 million.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "", "Right, but it's the $24.5 million that affects next year's cash flow. You get the money back at the end of next year.", "Frank Svoboda", "No next November. We\u2019ll get the $20.5 million back, we won\u2019t get the $4 million back but we\u2019ll get the 20.5.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. All right. And then if I may, on recruiting in general, and then on Liberty National Life, recruiting in general, obviously first year up. Any sense that the economy is helping with that?", "Frank Svoboda", "I think the real change is our internal recruiting incentives and the implementation of our improved training systems at both Liberty and American Income.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. And then, Larry, can you touch on -- it's interesting the agent count has been growing. The new recruits have been growing at Liberty National, but the renewals have not, and actually have continued to come down. What's the reason for that, and how do you fix that?", "Gary Coleman", "You want to fix it?", "Larry Hutchison", "", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fixed so much it\u2019s intentional that will change your compensation systems. Realize we\u2019re going to lose some veteran agents as to move from away from service ally, but we think it will stabilize and they are just greater just on new recruits. So over time all the changes we have implemented that Liberty National last few years, things are settling down the culture is been accepted. And I think we\u2019ll see the same percentage of better agents that we keep on Liberty, we see at American Income.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "So this decline is still left over from the competition changes?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Smith - Scotia Capital", "", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but on Family Heritage, did you give any guidance for agent recruiting -- or agent counts for the full year? I don't think I heard them, and if you did say them, I missed them.", "Gary Coleman", "", "No one has asked that question for any of the agencies. Looking at 2014 we expect the agent count of Family Heritage be between 775 agents and 800 agents. At American Income at the end of 2014 we expect the agent count to be between 6,000 agents and 6,100 agents. And Liberty National that increase between 1,550 agents to 1,600 agents.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll pick the next question from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Thanks very much. To a certain extent my question has been asked, but I'm hoping you can build on the answer to Steven Schwartz's question regarding Liberty. Where are you in the process of restructuring that Company to make it more like American Income? And do feel that you're getting the intended result? Are you are pleased with this effort to remake that Company?", "Gary Coleman", "I think the restructuring is completed at American Income and Liberty National. Over time we will change compensation and recruiting systems to expect the same and make the necessary changes as those agent counts grow. We\u2019re seeing some new offices that are productive at Liberty National. We opened two new offices in second quarter. We\u2019re planning to continue offices to the end of the year. If we look at the offices we opened last year we\u2019re pleased they\u2019re producing the expected levels that we hope to see. So I think at Liberty you\u2019ll see continued slow and steady growth but it takes time to develop that middle management that you can promote into the agency ownership position at Liberty National, Eric.", "Frank Svoboda", "Eric also looking at -- we knew going into this process will take time and we\u2019re starting to see positive, even more positive impact from before and we\u2019re pleased with the progress there.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Jenny Capital. Please go ahead.", "Bob Glasspiegel - Jenny Capital", "", "Good morning, everyone. Eric was on the same wavelength as I am. It seems like you've bumped up your sales outlook from low- to mid-singles across the board to approaching double-digit in all three segments. And I think this is after a few years of sales coming in disappointing. And clearly there's been a positive surprise to the sales momentum across the board and the pivots around agent count at both Liberty and American Income. So I'm a little surprised you don't have a little more bounce to your steps, Gary and Larry, in your pitch. You read it with the same level of intensity as you normally do. Am I right that you're pumped up about what's going on? And a little color on why direct is doing a little bit better than you thought going into the year?", "Gary Coleman", "", "I mean it is excited you use your term, we are pumped up and we are very pleased looking better recruiting, pushing better income intention while there are still factors as reducing more agent activity have made us and we are better finishers in place and expand your sales you have to have that higher level of agent activity. I think the sales growth that at direct response could explain by it will increase from electronic that in place about 20% for the full year. We\u2019re seeing strong increases in our electronic media both the Internet and inbound phone calls are up quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019re pleased with result set direct response.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan ", "", "Hi. On investment income, you mentioned you are expecting excess investment income to increase 3% to 5% I think it is in 2014. What's your expectation or your view on how much you can grow investment income next year if we actually stay at this type of environment, in terms of rates and your new money yield does not move up as you are expecting it to? And then how much do you think the portfolio yield will dropped next year if we are in this type of rate environment? So not necessarily looking for guidance, but just can you grow investment income at mid- to single-digit rate, if you actually see these types of rates? Or would investment income growth slow down dramatically next year?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Jimmy the current rate environment we feel like we can grow investment income next year to 3% to 4% range, it is more as a portfolio yield as you know with the cost we have as couple of years security results and dramatic deep climb in the portfolio yield. Now what we\u2019re looking at over the next five years that the portfolio yield assuming current new money rates as money rate 5% we talked about earlier that the portfolio yield was stabilize, it may drop 2 to 3 basis points in a year. And because the portfolio yields will be fairly stable, and we\u2019ll be seeing a growth in investment income that\u2019s in line with the growth in interest that we can grow investment income for next year in the four the range and take those investment activity because our interest expense is going be flat in those years, we think kind of maybe 3.5 at the midpoint for next period we\u2019re thinking it will be about 4% going forward.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then on the share buybacks, obviously over the past year and a half, the stock has done really well and the buybacks have become less accretive over time. Have you thought about the balance between buybacks and dividends? Have you looked at deploying capital at all, like shifting that balance in one direction or another?", "Gary Coleman", "", "Yes, we have and that something that we discuss over quarter with our board and in the last three years we\u2019ve increased our dividend rates, but to increase in further we still think buying back stock, we still think is good buy at this point. If things remain as they are, by now I think you will see as continue to increase our dividend rate but still the bulk of nine will be going to share repurchase program.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take the next question from Colin Devine with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Good morning, gentlemen. I'm just wondering, I have a couple of follow-up questions, if we could focus on the Life side. First, with respect to direct and sales, just to follow-up on your other comments, do you think the pace we've seen for the first half here is going to be sustainable over the second? Second question, if we take a look at the enforced role-forwards, were there some reserve adjustments made at either American Income or direct response? I'm looking at the levels for the death and others seem to move around a little bit, more than I would have expected. And then finally, could you provide a bit of color on how you've been able to achieve what's been really quite a steady reduction in your first-year lapse rates, improving those at both American Income and Liberty. When I look back to where they were a couple years ago, obviously it's been dramatic. Has that gone about as far as it's going to go, and how much is that impacting your profitability?", "Gary Coleman", "", "We think we are going to have mid to high level sales growth in direct response in the third and fourth quarters as you recall, our standard [indiscernible] insurance products were rolled out fully in three quarter 2013 Colin, those accounted for a good portion or sales growth in the first and second quarter, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see the same increases on quarter-over-quarter things as going forward probably we will have steady sales growth.", "Frank Svoboda", "", "Colin, the improvement in the last (ph) rates I think we began in 2010 but really geared up in 2011. To give you example the impact of this year we expect to conserve about $40 million of last premium. And other words about 16, little over 16% of the last we will reinstate. The impact to that is that impact of those policies closed, what we\u2019ve done in past years. We increased our premium income about little over $40 million; it will add $6 million to our underwriting income.", "That deposit program, like I said we\u2019ll say about 16% premium we think that percentage can go higher as we continue to find new ways to conserve the policies that but really have to attribute the improvements to conservation program.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Now, in terms of, if I think of American Income or Liberty National, looking at the current levels, the bulk continued to improve this year. Are we getting towards where 8% is going to be the run rate for American Income, and maybe a little over 7% for Liberty National? Or have you still got room to go?", "Gary Coleman", "", "That\u2019s a good question; we\u2019re getting to the point where we may not see much encouragement. Just about the 8% American Income just 2011 was 9 a quarter and we\u2019ve seen an improvement in Liberty National. But you get the point where that last rate is not going to improve that much more.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take the next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "John Myers - SunTrust", "", "This is Rob Myers on for Mark Hughes. I had a question, if you had any perception about the demand difference between whole life and term currently? If there's any industry-wide dynamic that you are gathering from the market?", "Gary Coleman", "I don\u2019t think we have a market internally. We don\u2019t see a shift from term to whole, your basic retention products in those cases. And so we\u2019re doing niche rate analysis in all of our agency sales, drives on a niche basis not whole versus a term product.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "", "I get that a lot. Good morning, everybody. So you've got this high-quality problem that continues, that your stock's valuation is roughly 2 times book. And I'm curious, it looks to me if I look at stock price daily during the quarter, it looks to me like you're -- and compare that to your average repurchase price, it looks like you were pretty strong on your buybacks in the first half the quarter, but tailed it off pretty significantly when the stock was in the $54 to $55 range, or roughly 2 times your 2Q book, XA-OSCI. Should we take anything away from that, or was it just a matter of the timing of your cash flow, the timing of putting the capital to work?", "Gary Coleman", "Frank you want to handle that?", "Frank Svoboda", "", "One thing I would probably note John is that we did have a significant portion of our purchases in the very first quarter when we had $210 million and an overall price there about $50.72. We did invest as we just looking at overall the timing will be a combination of both in that. And we did have as we normally would more purchases in the first part of the second quarter. As the price moved up probably is still down a little bit but we also clean off as we normally do, we\u2019re looking at spreading our purchases out over the course of the year and we\u2019re looking for about $190 million target for the first half of the year. And so that\u2019s what we really kind are trying to push towards.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. So I\u2019ll turn the program back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you for joining us this morning.

Good day, and welcome to the Torchmark Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Majors, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2013 10-K and any subsequent Form 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the third quarter was $131 million or $0.99 per share, a per share increase of 4% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $132 million or $1 per share, a 5% increase on a per share basis.", "On our second quarter conference call, the midpoint of the guidance provided for the full year 2014 anticipated net operating income of $1.01 per share in the third quarter. The actual net operating income was $0.02 lower due to higher than expected Part D drug costs.", "With fixed maturities at amortized cost, our return on equity as of September 30 was 15.1%, and our book value per share was $27.57, a 10% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share increased 27% to $34.55.", "In our Life Insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $492 million, and life underwriting margins were $139 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Net life sales increased 14% to $91 million.", "On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D grew 1% to $210 million, and health underwriting margin grew 5% to $49 million. Health sales increased from $23 million to $48 million.", "Administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter, 1% more than a year ago. For the full year 2014, we anticipate that administrative expenses will be up around 1% and be approximately 5.7% of premium.", "I have one more item to discuss before turning the call over to Larry. Recently, there were reports that Torchmark had suffered a data breach. There was an isolated internal breach in which we believe that someone at one of American Income's agency offices in the northwest used compromised login credentials to obtain personal information from approximately 400 insurance applications. We have notified the individuals affected and continue to follow the investigation.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. First, let's discuss American Income. At American Income, life premiums were up 7% to $194 million, and life underwriting margin was up 3% to $60 million. Net life sales were $43 million, up 18% due primarily to increased agent counts. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter were 6,155, up 13% from a year ago. The average count in the third quarter was 6,106, up 6% from the second quarter.", "We expect 11% to 12% life sales growth for the full year 2014 at 6% to 10% growth for 2015. At our direct response operation of Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $174 million, and life underwriting margin declined 2% to $41 million. Net life sales were up 7% to $35 million. We expect 8% to 9% life sales growth for the full year 2014, and 5% to 9% for 2015.", "At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $68 million, while life underwriting margin declined 7% to $18 million. Net life sales grew 18% to $9 million, and net health sales increased 22% to $4 million.", "The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,604, up 22% from a year ago. The average agent count for the third quarter was 1,554, up 4% from the second quarter. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 9% to 11% for the full year 2014, and 5% to 9% for 2015. Health net sales growth is expected to be within our range of 17% to 19% for the full year 2014, and 5% to 9% for 2015.", "Now, Family Heritage; health premiums increased 7% to $52 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 40% to $11 million. Health net sales were up 18% to $12 million. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 761, up 6% over a year ago. The average agent count for the third quarter was 763, up 1% from the second quarter. We expect sales growth for the full year 2014 to be in the range from 7% to 9%, and 4% to 10% for 2015.", "The United American General Agency health premiums increased 2% to $71 million; net health sales grew from 6 million to $10 million. We expect General Agency net sales growth for the full year 2014 to be in a range of approximately 30% to 40%. Our group health sales are hard to predict. We'd expect relatively flat sales in 2015 due to those two large group cases required in 2014.", "Now, direct response heath; Medicare supplement sales were $19 million compared to $1 million in the year ago quarter. This is due to a new large group case. Most of our Medicare supplement business is distributed to our United American General industries agency\u2019s channel. This case is classified as direct response, because we mail coverage offers directly to the retailers as coverage is available on a voluntary basis. We expect sales in a range of $22 million to $23 million in 2014, and $5 million to $7 million in 2015.", "Premium revenue from Medicare Part D grew 17% to $90 million, while the underwriting margin declined from $9 million to $5 million. The decline in underwriting margin was due to the higher than anticipated Part D drug costs we mentioned earlier. We expect Part D premiums of $345 million to $350 million in 2014, and $190 million to $235 million in 2015. Despite a significant decline in premiums expected for 2015, dollar margins are specifically relatively flat due to reduced exposure to auto-enrollment claims. Frank will discuss this further in his comments.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I'll spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income; excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 3% over the third quarter of 2013.", "On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 8%. For the full year, we expect excess investment income to increase by about 3%, and on a per share basis the increase should be about 8% % compared to 2013. These growth percentages are negatively impacted by Part D. We estimate that the delay in receiving reimbursement from CMS for the higher than expected Part D claims will result in $4 million of lost investment income for the full year. Excluding this reduction, the increase in 2004 excess investment income will be about 5% or 10% of our share basis.", "Now, regarding the investment portfolio; invested assets were $13.3 billion, including $12.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $12.2 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus, and below investment grade bonds are $570 million compared to $586 million in a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.5% compared to 4.8% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.5 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 16%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus, same as the year ago.", "In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.4 billion, approximately the same as at the end of the second quarter.", "Now, regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $174 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.24%, and average rating of A minus at an average life of 18 years. The average yield and the average life are lower than in previous quarters due to over half of third quarter investments being made in private placements. Excluding private, new investments in the third quarter had an average yield of 4.86% and an average life of 29 years.", "Through today, the fourth quarter new money rate has been about 4.75%, which is the rate we've assumed for fourth quarter at the midpoint of the 2014 guidance.", "For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.89%, down two basis points from the 5.91% yield in the third quarter of 2013. At September 30th, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.90%. We're concerned about the decline in new money rates this year. In the past analysts calls we've discussed in details the impact of a lower (indiscernible) interest rate environment.", "As a reminder, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement, but not the balance sheet. If we primarily say our non-interest protection products account fall under Cloud 60 (indiscernible) or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not perceive a negative impact on our [same store] (ph) balance sheet.", "While we'd benefit from high interest rates, Torchmark will continue to earn a substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I'd like to first take a few minutes to discuss the reduction in 2014 earnings guidance. The midpoint of our guidance fell $0.08 from $4.10 to $4.02; $0.05 of this reduction is due to additional adverse Part D experience. The remaining $0.03 includes the effect of both higher Part D claims and a lower new money rates on excess investment income, and slightly lower underwriting income from our non-Part D operations.", "With respect to Part D, we have added new schedule on our Web site entitled \"Medicare Part D margins,\" which provides information regarding Part D premiums and margins.", "As can be seen on the schedule, the Part D margin as a percentage of premium is expected to decline from 11.8% in 2013 to 7% to 8% in 2014. This reduction results from higher claims driven primarily by two issues. One: Claims that are related to the new Hepatitis C drugs that are trending at the high end of the range, we discussed on our second quarter call, and through a CMS administrative rule change implemented in the third quarter retroactive to the beginning of the year that effectively shifts responsibility for a portion of Part D claims expenditures on group business, from CMS to insurance carriers.", "For 2015, we expect significantly less volatility in Part D. One: We have adjusted our 2015 pricing to reflect the impact of the Hepatitis C drugs and the administrative rule change. And two: We expect to have about 87% fewer auto-assigned insurance in 2015 than we have in 2014.", "Since auto-assigns have accounted for nearly 85% of our Hepatitis C claims this year, our exposure to Hepatitis C claims should be much lower next year. While the loss of auto-assigns will result in lower premium income in 2015, we expect underwriting margins to remain relatively flat in 2015, compared to 2014, because the percent of premium profit margin should return to pre-2014 level.", "As we've discussed before, the higher than expected Part D cost don't just impact our underwriting margins. They also impact our net investment income. The higher cost increase the amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government, and we won't give reimbursed by CMS for their share of the cost until November of 2015. The impact of the higher part declines in 2014 on our excess investment income has been included in our guidance for both 2014 and 2015.", "Next, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $97.6 million to buy 1.8 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.72. For the full year through today, we have spent $317.3 million of parent company cash to acquire six million shares at an average price of $52.30; apparent start of the year with liquid assets of $60 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2014.", "Free cash flow results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2014 to be around $375 million. Thus, including the $60 million available from assets on hand as of the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $435 million of cash in liquid assets available to the parent during the year.", "As previously noted, to-date in 2014, we have used $317 million to purchase Torchmark shares leaving around $118 million of cash available for the remainder of the year.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible; add some better alternatives, and if market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be the primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets as a parent company. For 2015, we preliminarily estimate that our free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $360 million to $370 million.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries; as stated on previous calls, we have maintained our insurance company capital levels at or above an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis, which has historically been sufficient to maintain our ratings. This RBC ratio is lower than some peer companies, but has been sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risks of our assets and policy liability. We currently expect to exceed our targeted RBC levels for 2014.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2014, we expect our net operating income to be within the range of $4 per share to $4.04 per share. For 2015, we expect our net operating income per share to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.55, resulting in a midpoint of $4.35, an 8% increase over the midpoint of our current 2014 guidance. Those are our comments.", "We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll first go to Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions. You discussed the Part D claims issue, but I'm wondering if you could talk about the higher life claims as well. It seems like life insurance claims are higher than they had been in a while. And then secondly on buybacks, given what S&P published a couple of months ago, had there been any change in your long-term strategy on share buybacks and how you think about capital left that\u2019s not been to the holdco level?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. Jimmy, first, we'll talk about the life claims. Life claims were up primarily in direct response, although they were up slightly in the Liberty National American Income. Direct response declines were trending slightly higher than we expected at this point during the year, and I think we're expecting to be -- the policy obligation percentage to be half a point or a point higher than what we had in all of 2013. We don't think there is a significant trend there, but that's something we will monitor.", "Our American, our Liberty National, part of the increase there was that we have a (inaudible)in the third quarter of '13, but we expect the full year policy obligations to be at or around maybe slightly higher than what we had for 2013, but again we see this is more of a fluctuation than a trend.", "In American Income, our policy obligation percentage there has been within 1% range for several years. We think that the third quarter being a little bit higher is again a fluctuation and not a trend. But for the full year, we're expecting it's going to come in at around 32%, which is what we were last year and what we anticipate going forward.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, on buybacks?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. Then, Jimmy, on the buybacks and the S&P issue, we do not see at this point in time any change in the long-term strategy on the buyback. We're still evaluating our various options to address the shortfall that S&P has, and -- I just want to point out that's just a change in view with respect to capitalization that we've had in place at the holding company and our insurance companies required some time. So there's really been no significant changes there, but we do think that there are other alternatives out there for us to use other than changing any philosophy on the buyback.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "And then just lastly, you mentioned, like, low rates being a headwind for earnings, not for the balance sheet. But if we are in this type of environment, can you discuss what you're -- are you doing anything on the pricing side to offset part of the impact or are you just like accepting low returns as long as rates are low?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, we're not anticipating increase in pricing at this point. But I think if you remember, I think it was a year or two ago, we increased rates of both American Income and direct response. And we at that time we increased the rates more than we probably needed to. And so, I think if we stay in this whole way down where we are I think (indiscernible) back then. I think we're okay at this point.", "Frank Svoboda", "Once thing I'd add to that, Gary. At that point, when we put enough pricing increase, we really anticipated at the time that the rates would stay low, at least in the 2015. So at this point in time, it's not a real surprise.", "Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Eric Bass from Citigroup.", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Hi, thank you. I just want to start on the Part D business; since you said your thoughts on long-term view on the Part D market, this has been the most volatile piece of your business in recent years. It seems like it's getting harder to predict from year-to-year. So, does this change at all how you're thinking about pricing and whether you want to attract auto enrollees going forward?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, exactly. We don't like volatility and most of the higher claim costs and the volatility we've had has been in the auto-assigns. We're going to have a significant reduction in auto enrollees next year. I think we're going to be very careful in our products in the (indiscernible) law.", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Got it. So, if we think about the premium growth kind of beyond 2015, we should not assume a significant increase because you attract more auto enrollees in the future. Is that a reasonable way to think about it?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes. You won't see the big increases that we had because that has come, as we said, the auto enrollees will still stay with our individual group business, and we expect just moderate growth there.", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Okay. And then maybe we can just switch quickly to free cash flow, I think your guidance for next year is implying free cash flow that's a little bit down from what it was this year. Imagine some of that may be that drag from the higher Part D claims and low investment income, but if you could just talk about any other moving pieces there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Eric. That's exactly right. Our preliminary estimates and I will stress that it's pretty preliminary at this point, because we have not even completed our third quarter statutory filings and statutory income projections. But our initial look for statutory earnings in 2014 would indicate that they are -- actually will come in just a little bit lower than we had in 2013. Therefore the dividends up from the insurance companies in 2015 is expected to be just a little bit less, and that's what's really driving the slight decrease in the free cash flow.", "And it really is primarily the drag from the Part D operations that we're seeing in 2014 on both investment income as well as underwriting. Then you'll notice in general, we from -- funding several initiatives with respect to our sales growth, and keep in mind that all those funding, those initiatives are fully expensed on a statutory basis, so those do tend to have a little drag on the earnings as well.", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Got it. Thank you. And just last very quickly, can you [found out that] (ph) what could you assume for life underwriting margins in your '15 guidance?", "Gary Coleman", "The midpoint to our guidance, the underwriting margins are around 20%, 28% and 29%, which is -- we're going to end 2014 probably at 28.5, and so it's -- we're not expecting it to change from the fiscal \u2026 ", "Eric Bass - Citigroup", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Hi, great, thanks. I have a couple. One is just a follow-up on what Eric was asking there and is that -- and this goes back to Frank, a commentary on the opening part of the call, but when you say that underwriting margins in Part D are going to recover to more normal levels, I think that would be low-teens underwriting margin. I just want to clarify that, and are you assuming that auto enrollee claims also improve next year or that there just simply won't be as many, when you talk about the overall underwriting margin for Part D improving next year?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, it's really is a little bit of a combination. Both the underwriting margin that we're seeing overall, we do expect to be in that 10% to 13% range. So we do see that clearly, which is about where we've been pricing and where we've estimated on normal course in the past few years. And then, you truly just have less exposure to the autos. Several of the region the autos have very low underwriting margins as we've lost those regions, then we're starting to see that the overall margins on the auto -- what is left on the auto-assign business should come up as well.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay. You don't think that there would be a region increase I guess, that the other regions would have the same problem, as the other the reason I think that would be different experience?", "Frank Svoboda", "We just have. I mean we're basically going from 22 regions in 2014 to where we're going to have four regions in 2015. So we just have fewer numbers. Basically, our enrollment and it's an 87% decline of what we're anticipating as a decrease in the overall enrollment in the auto-assigns.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "All right, so that's helpful. It's more dramatic on the drop and the autos; got it. And then I guess I'm going to ask about the brief just because it feels like the stock is maybe off a little bit more than what happened fundamentally. It sounds like your explanation here is that it sounds quite limited with 400 applications being affected and those folks being notified. I guess the idea the two questions I have is, is there a financial exposure here that's notable, and is this the same issue has being outlined in (indiscernible) article online? Is it the same thing as that?", "Larry Hutchison", "Hi, this is Larry. We don't think there's any financial exposure here. I think a breach is really the wrong term to use here. It is not a third-party -- it can be information taken from someone within the organization. Actually, this information is very small. And we contacted the 400 people involved, so we don't expect any further activity around those item.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Okay. And could you -- is it the same issue that's being covered in the online media on that?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, it is.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "All right, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, everybody. Going back to the Part D segment or operations; is there -- would you be able to quantify the earnings, headwinds, end of 2015 from the cash flow issue there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. We basically have about a $115 million that we are going to be receiving, if you will, from CMS in late 2015. So we estimate the last investment earning should be close to $6 million, the headwinds for 2015.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I guess if I take that out of the midpoint of that, of the 2015 guidance range, and I compare that to the original guidance range for 2013, I get the EPS growth of roughly 6%, 7% year-over-year. And I guess it just seems a little below maybe (indiscernible) see from Torchmark. I was curious what else was going on there \u2026 ", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, which also need to take into account when you're looking at that is the drag on '14 from the Part D operation. So, our underwriting income, the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of the year, we were anticipating around $36 million. We're looking at coming in around somewhere in the range of $26 million, $25 million to $27 million in 2014. And we expect that to be relatively flat going into 2015.", "So that's creating from your starting point, that's creating an additional drag plus. So as we looked at it, if you do include the $6 million at the midpoint of the 2015 guidance and compare it to the midpoint of our final guidance here for 2014, you'll end up somewhere real north of 9%.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then, maybe switching gears a little bit to agent count, it seems like both in Liberty National and American Income, they're a little bit ahead of the schedule. Do you anticipate that the growth will slow down a little bit in the coming quarters or to continue seeing that this healthy clip?", "Gary Coleman", "Yaron Kinar, we're not expecting a significant drop in the agent count. However, historically, we've seen increase in agent terminations in fourth quarter, Liberty National, the same phenomena, I think for both distribution, we issued the guidance for 2015 in terms of the agent counts, or be in a better position (indiscernible) we will be able to see what terminations occurred in the fourth quarter on both distributions, also (indiscernible) in the month of January 2015.", "Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I appreciate the answers. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Hey, good morning everybody. First, just on the excess investment income 2015, what are you assuming? Are you assuming, I guess first question, that's the new money rate will continue at a 475 level?", "Gary Coleman", "Steven, we're assuming that we'll be investing a little over 5% at the midpoint.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "And they started out a little bit lower than that at the beginning (indiscernible) as the year goes on.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, (indiscernible) from your mouth. So given that, how should we think about the rate on the portfolio coming down over the year?", "Gary Coleman", "I think that right in the portfolio, it will come down around three to four basis points.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "For the year or per quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "For the year.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "For the year, okay. And then, I want to go back to Part D, so my understanding is that you price for the non-auto enrollees depending upon your pricing, then you get assigned auto enrollees. Is that correct?", "Frank Svoboda", "We would actually -- within a particular region we'd end up putting in a bid. That would anticipate whether or not we'd get auto enrollees for that particular region.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Frank, I guess what I'm imagining here and maybe I'm wrong, but what I'm imagining here is that if you price not to get auto enrollees, doesn't that mean that your rate on non-auto enrollees, I mean, is it going to be very, very profitable, maybe more so that had been in the past. Is that what you think, the reason why it's not to get and so the remainder I would think the margin would be very high.", "Frank Svoboda", "While you're ultimately pricing overall with respect to what are you getting auto enrollees and not, you're still not, the experience overall, between the non-auto enrollees we aren't -- I guess I'll just say that the experience that we're seeing is not necessarily resulting in excessively high margins on the non-auto enrollees.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay, all right. And then, the S&P issue with regards to the financing is that correct that it has to do with preferred share financing, it has to do with the internal financing of reserves?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, internal financing of the overall capital, and back in 1998 we had -- at the time that we spent our Waddell & Reed, we actually had put some preferred stock into the capital structure of the insurance companies. And in exchange, absolute debt at that point in time but it's really done in connection with that that's been on Waddell & Reed back at that point in time. And they've been in place ever since.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. So this doesn't have to do with capital finance or anything like that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "Steven Schwartz - Raymond James", "Okay. Thank you. That's (indiscernible).", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you. If I could just ask a follow-up question on the timing of the CMS reimbursement question, If we look out into 2016, does that $6 million of lost income, does that just subside or does that actually reverse?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, I think it should subside, one just having better than reversing. We're expecting to receive that around a $115 million in the fourth quarter typically it ends up being in November. That can change just a little bit. And for then it will be there in these final invested assets as of the end of 2015, which will impact the 2016 earnings.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And I suppose, with mix shift of auto enrollees and rough spend (indiscernible) I guess what I was trying to get out with this question, if there is any maybe excess cash flow that comes in, in '15 in terms of reimbursements that would cause maybe 16 to be a little bit not normal in terms of investment growth there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. What we're anticipating with respect to the 2015 plan, so we always estimate, we do attempt to estimate what the settlement with CMS is going to be every year. Right now, our estimate for 2015 is that we'll actually be growing that receivable if you will buy about another $30 million. And so over the course of 2015, which is also build into our guidance that we'll be funding about $30 million worth of claims on behalf of CMS over the course of the year, and then, in 2016, we'll be -- at the end of '15, then, we would have a net receivable from them at about $30 million that will be impacting 2016 earnings.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. And then, if I could ask just one other question on sales growth guidance, and if I look across different life channels, mid single-digits, as opposed to upper single-digits, last year in 2014, maybe just some commentaries on setting those, what's causing the decline there, if maybe '15, that's the more normalized growth number in '14, coming out of an easy comp or what lead to that maybe conservative growth guidance?", "Gary Coleman", "That should be on the agency, its agent growth that drives the growth in sales. I was seeing a pattern historically in each of the companies that we have stair step growth in the agency. Something 20% agency growth in American Income and you have similar growth for Liberty National this year, you wouldn't expect to have 20% growth next year; must get the sales guidance at 6% to 10% of American Income in model within that different levels of agency growth, different levels of percentage (indiscernible) that range, because ", "as the year moves on and if we have short agency growth, this calls for the 10% growth. If the agency grows slowly, it's going to be close to the 6%.", "Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Colin Devine from Jefferies.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Good morning. And looking at the life, I guess the underwriting ratio or the benefit ratio, the one that stuck out for me was direct response. And you really haven't talked about that. And yet, it seemed to be the highest in the last nine to 10 years, and probably two standard deviations above the average over that period. Was something particular that happened there?", "Gary Coleman", "Colin, I mentioned email that we've had higher climbs in the third quarter than expected. And as a result of that, we may be more -- 47% to 47.5% is a percentage of all sale negations, whereas last year, it was 46.4%. I think it's been around that for several quarters. It's going forward. There will be a net 46% and 47% range. We still like -- so, again I think it's more a fluctuation and then we've been turning to that 46, 47 number for several quarters now.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "That's why I wanted, with the number 48 that just seemed \u2026 ", "Gary Coleman", "What I think is seeing there a little bit is the catch-up effect of the first couple of quarters where in that 46 range, but we're seeing over the course of the year, that we're now saying it should be on that 47 a year said, you know, 47 or 47.5 to seem a little bit of a catch-up there in the third quarter.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Okay. And then, with respect to the agent recruiting this quarter which I thought was quite strong. Can you talk a little bit more about what was behind that and obviously what you're doing to quote and place to really hold on to our agent just to go forward. Have you changed anything there?", "Gary Coleman", "We mentioned in the prior calls that we changed our (indiscernible) recruiting. This year versus last year, we actually had a quarter-over-quarter increase on recruiting. But also this strong growth on our middle management count this year. The middle management didn't help support the agent growth. In addition, we're seeing a slight increase recent retention which is another (indiscernible).", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "I was looking at that. That's what and why I was a little surprised when you took the sales guidance down, given what this, when you've done recruiting. So something there that's just are you just being cautious?", "Gary Coleman", "Being conscience based on the history of each of the agency forces. When I think about agency, it doesn't grow on a one-year fashion. It really, there's step growth. And you have certain agents, you would expect to see some increase in terminations in the following several quarters. (Indiscernible) see what's driving that agent force and life changes, continuing that level of growth. You would like to think we're going to have back to back 10% or 15% increases in agent channel. I think that's not realistic on a historical basis, it just stretch a little over agent growth in 2015 and in 2014.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Thank you. Then the final one, you haven't talked in many quarters about what's been going on in sort of first command and such. Can you give us any update on that, it's just so a meaningful part of the overall premiums?", "Gary Coleman", "We're seeing some positive results. First command, we seen is increase in the sales at first command. I think the important part of our business is not core. We really focus our growth in direct response, American Income and Liberty National with respect to the life operations.", "Colin Devine - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Nadel from Sterne, Agee.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Good morning, everybody.", "Gary Coleman", "Good morning, Mr. Nadel.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Yes. It will happen. The question I really want to talk about was just -- I really want to understand some of the thoughts and maybe some of the risks that you might be seeing around the lower end of 2015 guidance. I mean if I -- first of all, I guess, it's a wider range of guidance and I think we've historically seeing from you guys but the lower end of the guidance implies I believe 3% year-over-year EPS growth from your midpoint of '14. And if I assume your buybacks at or around the current pace, that actually suggests to me that at the lower end of your EPS range, it might actually contemplate actual earnings being down on a year-over-year basis. I guess, I'm just trying to understand where is the cost in there?", "Gary Coleman", "(Indiscernible).", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Yes. Let's say, as we look at the ranges, I think it's taking in to account very early in the process and we haven't finalized the statutory income. So that clearly one piece is statutory earnings would have a come in a little bit differently. And we have less cash flow, free cash flow available for the buybacks. And then of course volatility in the marketplace and so we do tend to as we're looking at our ranges at this beginning. At this point in time, we're kind of trying to take a look at, where some of the -- it's all lot of really bad things happen or if a lot of really good things happen, those kind of set the outside boundary.", "We don't spend an awful lot of time now, we're more focused on clearly around that the midpoint of that, that we're recognizing that there is some extreme events that could impact on either side. And if we have that unfortunate confluence of example, we've really bad client experience on the life side, and we don't get that off set with some positive on the health side. We are really bad on the health as well. Part D ends up being -- it's a low end of their margin. And if rates stay really low and those type of things, so we're just kind of trying to -- that's I think, there is no specific changes if you will that we're anticipating that would kid of pop into there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Okay. So if I could -- and I don't want to necessarily put words in your mouth, but if I were going to paraphrase, I'd say the lower end of the guidance is essentially just to -- the opportunity that if a bunch of things just go against you, in 2015, weaker underwriting margins generally and maybe slightly lower buyback, there you go.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "That's right. Okay. It seems and I guess that makes sense, because if I look at the top line trends, particularly here, in the first nine months of 2014. Top line growth has accelerated a little bit, your sales growth has been certainly very strong, stronger I think than even you guys had expected it might be, and that is a backdrop, recognizing long-term investment rates are challenging, but with top line growth starting to pick up a bit, it seems difficult to assume that earnings, not EPS, but earnings could be down on year-over-year basis. Unless I guess you get some underwriting issues like claims, so that's the way you're thinking about it?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. It has to take some unusual events.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "I'll jump -- first of all, it's really earlier to be projecting 2015, we'll tie to that when we get to the fourth quarter call, but I think we build -- the midpoint is really where we're thinking we're going to be. At that midpoint, the 4.35, if we weren't losing the $6 million investment income because of this Part D thing, that has another $0.03, that gives us $4.38. That will be over 9% increase. We feel like it's going to be more around that midpoint and neither the higher or lower.", "John Nadel - Sterne, Agee", "Got it, okay. That's a very helpful color. That's really important, thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to Mark Hughes from SunTrust. And we'll actually go to Ryan Krueger from KBW.", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Hi, good morning. I just have a couple more questions on '15 guidance; can you just give us what your administrative expense great expectation is next year? And then also I don't think you've said this yet, what percentage growth you expect in excess investment income in '15?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. The administrative expenses, we're thinking to grow 3% to 5% next year. And investment income, we think the growth rate there will be at the midpoint. I think we have assumed 2.5% -- that's lower than what we have in 2014. But like I mentioned to John a while ago, with the add back we're losing on Part D, the increase in investment income would be over 3%, and that's what we'd expect.", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Got it. And then, your admin expense growth have been in I think growing in the 1% to 2% range probably for a little while, why are you expecting that to increase more going forward?", "Frank Svoboda", "Ryan, in 2014, it grew about 1%, and that's largely because of our pension expense. It was very high in 2013 and it dropped in 2014 with the change in the discount rate. Without a change in the discount rate, it would have grown more than that in that 3% range, without the decrease of a pension expense in 2014. So looking forward 2014, 2015, you don't have that offsetting impact on it and it will be growing just in a more normal 3%, 4%, 5% level.", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Got it, thanks. And then last one, just on the S&P issue, is there any real reason for you to react to this because I think S&P's rating is already one above the other rating agencies. So I guess the question is would you just tick to downgrade or do you actually feel you need to react?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, it's clearly one of the factors that we're already evaluating as we look at our options. And we do recognize that the S&P rating does not have a particular substantial impact or really any impact on our marketing efforts, and we do recognize that many of our peer companies and most of our peer companies do have their S&P rating, the lower. So it's something that we're taking to consideration and thinking about as we look at those options.", "Gary Coleman", "Ryan, I'd say we'd like to maintain the ratings, but time maybe a good part. From a marketing standpoint, the S&P or Moody's ratings aren't that important. In our business, the rating is important (indiscernible) we have A plus, that's far more important (indiscernible).", "Ryan Krueger - KBW", "Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll now move to Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg - RBC", "Thanks very much. So I've had a chance to look at the exhibits that you filed on your Web site, entitled Medicare Part D margins, S&P contemplate a much smaller business, but a more profitable business next year than this year. Can you review with us -- you touched on it, but could you go directly to the question, how does the government sign into these auto enrollees and how can you be as confident as you're right now that the auto enrollees will be down so sharply next year from current levels?", "Frank Svoboda", "There is a -- when you submit a bid into a particular region, for particular plans, your filed plan, and we know already for 2015 whether or not the bid that we put in is -- how that compares to a benchmark premium, so essentially CMS takes all of the bids from all the different insurance companies that are covering low income subsidy individuals and comes up with what they call \"a benchmark premiums.\" If your submitted premium is less than that benchmark premium, then you're automatically given auto-assigns. So when everybody -- all the insurance companies that have qualifying bids are then on a proportional basis assigned the auto-assigns and the enrolling individuals.", "If your bid is above that benchmark premium by more than $2, then you're out, and you're not going to be pulled back in. So, for the bids that we submitted for 2015, we've already been notified their bid was too high as compared to the benchmark premium. And again, you don't know what that benchmark premium is going to be at the time you submit your bids, but at this time in time we know that we're out in albeit four regions versus the 22 that we're in, in 2014.", "Eric Berg - RBC", "So, in short; just to go through this in a little bit more detail, you know you have far fewer auto enrollees next year than this year. You know the auto enrollees had been the preponderance of the higher than expected Hepatitis-related claims.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. That provides 85% of the Hepatitis C claims.", "Eric Berg - RBC", "And so, with fewer, in short with 4Q or higher claimants on the roll next year than this year, do you expect a smaller business, but a more profitable business in percentage terms, product margin percentage terms, is that a match up?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct, and with less volatility, because of our fewer auto-assigns.", "Eric Berg - RBC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll now go to Mike (indiscernible).", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, thanks. This is Mike (indiscernible). Liberty National life sales accelerated again this quarter to now very strong levels, shall we expect total premium growth to move into positive territory sooner? I guess I'd have expected it to be closer breakeven by now, so maybe I'm missing necessarily higher laps component or something.", "Gary Coleman", "I think if you think there is problem in sales growth going forward, we expect to be in a positive premium loan some time in 2017.", "Larry Hutchison", "Mike, the one reason that's taken a while to (indiscernible) block, and there is nothing unusual about the laps really, it's just a big block and we've had ups and downs and multi downs in sales in the past few years. Now, we've had sales growth, it's just going to take a couple of years that sales growth to get where we can at least breakeven on the premium.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it, that's helpful. Lastly, we could take offline if I'm missing something, but I think Larry during the prepared comments out to big jump in direct response of health sales. Could you give us some more color on what took place and why you expect the sales that follow-up next year. Maybe that's the whole auto enrollment things that you're talking about. Thank you.", "Larry Hutchison", "The direct response in the health job is the Medicare Supplement that we offer to the direct mail authors. It's an existing channel of distribution. We include those Medicare settlement sales in the direct response category. And we had a very large group who was added in the third quarter. And next year, we're not expecting another large group, and that's why the sales guidance for next year is in much smaller percentage than this year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. And so, the (indiscernible) is that helping out there or is there any correlation there?", "Larry Hutchison", "I'd tell you, the overall results are better than what anticipated in the current season. (Indiscernible) through brand awareness and that's resulted in the growth in inquiries, and most were immediate channels.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2013 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $131 million or $1 dollar per share, a per share increase of 30% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $147 million or $1.13 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. With fixed maturities and amortized cost, our return on equity as of December 31, was 14.9% and our book value per share was $27.91, an 8% increase from year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities and market value, book value per share increased 31% to $36.19. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $494 million, while life underwriting margins were $136 million, down 1% from a year ago.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $225 million and health underwriting margin grew 3% to $51 million. Health sales increased from $40 million to $72 million, $25 million of the increase was due to group business and the remaining $7 million was related to individual business. Administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter, down 2% from year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $180 million or 5.7% of premium. In 2015, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6% to 7% and be approximately 5.8% of premium. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher pension costs resulting from the required implementation of a new mortality table and further investments in IT systems.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. We are very pleased that we had strong sales growth in each of the distribution channels for both the quarter and the full year. Now, I would like to discuss results for each of those channels. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $196 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $62 million. Net life sales were $46 million, up 23% due primarily to increased agent counts. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,434, up 21% from a year ago. The average agent count the fourth quarter was 6,323, up 4% from the third quarter. We expect life sales growth in 2015 to be within a range of 6% to 10%. At our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $174 million. But life underwriting margin declined 9% to $37 million. Net life sales were up 10% to $38 million. We expect 4% to 8% life sales growth for 2015.", "At Liberty National life premiums were $67 million, approximately the same as the year ago quarter. Our life underwriting margin declined 16% to $16 million. Net life sales grew 15% to $9 million, while net health sales increased 19% to $5 million. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,498, up 5% from a year ago. The average agent count the fourth quarter was 1,572, up 1% from the third quarter. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 6% to 10% for 2015. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range 4% to 8% for 2015.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $53 million, while health underwriting margin increased 12% to $11 million. Health net sales were up 8% to $12 million. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 785, up 13% over a year ago. The average agent count for the fourth quarter was 782, up 2% from the third quarter. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 4% to 10% for 2015.", "At United American General Agency count premiums increased 8% to $81 million. Net health sales grew from $22 million to $51 million. Of the $51 0230 million in 2014 sales individual sales were $12 million, up 15%, our group sales were $39 million compared to $14 million a year ago. In 2015, we expect growth in individual sales to be around 14% to 16%, while group health sales are hard to predict we expect them to decline in 2015 due to the unusual number of large group cases we acquired in 2014. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D grew 22% to $90 million while the underwriting margin declined from $10 million to $5 million. The decline in underwriting margin was due to the higher than unanticipated Part D drug costs discussed in our previous calls. We expect Part D premiums of $315 million to $335 million in 2015 and expect margin as a percentage of premium to be approximately 6% to 8%. Frank will discuss this further in his comments.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income, excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $56 million, an increase of 2% over the fourth quarter of 2013. On a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 8%.", "As we discussed previously excess investment income was negatively impacted by Part D to the extent of $2 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $5 million for the full year. Excluding the negative impact of Part D, excess investment income would have increased almost 5% for the year or about 10% on per share basis. For 2015, we expect excess investment income to decrease by about 1% to 3%. However, on a per share basis we should see an increase of about 3% to 4%. At the midpoint of our 2015 guidance we are expecting a further drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $6 million.", "Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $13.3 billion, including $12.8 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $12.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $561 million compared to $566 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4% compared to 4.5% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.5 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 15%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A- same as the year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $250 million higher at the end of the third quarter.", "To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I would like to address our investments in the energy sector. We believe the risk of realizing losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. Over 99% of our energy holdings are investment grade. And at the end of 2014, our energy portfolio had net unrealized gains of $152 million. Also less than 10% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. And we have reviewed our energy holdings and concluded that while we may see some downgrades, we believe that the companies we have invested in can withstand low oil prices for an extended duration.", "As to investment yield, in the fourth quarter, we invested $205 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.8% and we are trading at BBB+ and an average life of 29 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.89%, down 1 basis point from the 5.9% yield in the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.89%. We are concerned about the decline in new money rates this year and as a result, we lowered the new money rates from our previous guidance. The midpoint of our current guidance for 2015 assumes new money yields of 4.5% for the first half of the year and 4.75% for the second half.", "On past analyst calls we have discussed in detail the impact of a lower, prolonger interest rate environment. As a reminder, an extended low interest rate environment impacts our income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for in the past 60, we don\u2019t see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. First, regarding our share repurchases and parent company assets, in the fourth quarter, we spent $87 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $52.76. For the full year, we spent $375 million of parent company cash to acquire 7.2 million shares at an average price of $52.42. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $57 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional cash flow in 2015.", "Free cash flow results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from the subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2014 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $355 million to $365 million. Thus including the $57 million available from assets on hand, we currently expect to have around $417 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. To-date in 2015, we have used $34.3 million of this cash to buy 656,000 Torchmark shares. As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries, we plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Although we haven\u2019t finalized our 2014 statutory financial statements, we expect that the RBC percentage at December 31, 2014 will be slightly above the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2015.", "Now, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to discuss our Part D operations. Our final underwriting results were largely in line with our expectations, ending the year with $27 million underwriting margins or 7.8% of premiums. As discussed on our last call, this margin is less than originally anticipated primarily because of higher-than-expected hepatitis C claims during the year. Included on our website is a schedule entitled Medicare Part D margins, which provides information regarding Part D premiums and margins for 2013, 2014 and estimated for 2015. As the schedule shows, we anticipate higher premiums and indicated on our last call. This is due primarily to higher than anticipated enrollments in both our individual and group plan offerings during the enrollment period. Premiums from auto enrollees will be approximately $25 million to $28 million the same as indicated in our last call.", "Although we expect higher premiums, we expect that our underwriting margins will be relatively flat to slightly lower than 2014 and then our margin as a percentage of premium will be lower than last indicated. The revised outlook in the margin percentage is as a result of preliminary analysis of the risk scores and claims history of our actual 2015 enrollees. The mix of enrollees for 2015 preliminarily indicates higher utilization of higher cost drugs which have lower margins.", "As noted on our last call, the higher-than-expected Part D cost in 2014 didn\u2019t just impact underwriting income, but also resulted in lower net investment income. These higher costs resulted in higher amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government and won\u2019t get reimbursed to us until November 2015. For 2014, net investment income was negatively impacted by approximately $4.5 million. In 2015, the midpoint of our guidance anticipates about $6 million of reduced investment income as a result of the delayed 2014 cash flows plus additional cash outflows expected to occur in 2015. Those are my comments.", "I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2015, we expect our net operating income to be within the range of $4.20 per share to $4.40 per share, a 7% increase over 2014 at the midpoint. The $0.05 reduction at the midpoint from our previous guidance was due primarily to the increase in pension expense, reduction in expected Part D margins, and a reduction in expected earnings from our Canadian operations due to the recent change in the Canadian exchange rate. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik Bass", "Hi, thank you. Just wanted to spend a little bit more time on Part D and I was hoping you could talk about what changed in Part D and why enrollments you think ended up being so much higher than your initial expectations? And then also as you touched on your margin guidance, it\u2019s obviously lower than previously and it seems to imply that you are expecting some adverse selection. So, maybe if you could comment a little bit more, what is it about the enrollment base that suggests that would be the case?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Eric. With respect to the enrollments, at the time of the last call, we are using our best estimates taking a look at kind of normal trends in the premium, taking into account the premium rate increases that we had put into effect working with our consultant to look at a particular mix and trying to get an estimate of the total number of enrollees that we might have. Keep in mind it was before obviously the open enrollment period that occurred in the fourth quarter. So, we did end up having a substantially higher amount of enrollments within our individuals by about two-thirds of the added enrollments in our individual plans and then we did have higher group sales in the fourth quarter as well. And as I noted before, the auto enrollees ended up being about the same as where the same as where we ended up \u2013 what we had indicated on our last call with total premiums around $25 million, which is at 85% or so decrease from 2014 levels.", "With respect to the margins, the decrease is really just higher. It is higher expected claims and fewer drug rebates than we had originally anticipated. And it\u2019s across all of our businesses both the individual and group, but the last guidance was again given prior to the actual enrollment results and now with those \u2013 with the final enrollment results and being able to see who exactly is in the plan, we are just better able to estimate the anticipated drug utilization and cost. And it just does appear that the group that we have is a group that has higher utilization and actually it\u2019s having a little higher utilization of higher cost drugs, which then while they are included in our pricing really just have a lower margin and tend to have fewer rebates from the pharmaceutical companies.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So it ended up essentially then that your pricing was a little bit more competitive than you had initially expected?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. I think there is a lot of different factors that enter into why a particular individual chooses our plan versus another. And the websites, I think facilitate that comparison and really we are taking a look into what maybe some of those factors are, but at this time, we don\u2019t have all those answers.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. Maybe just a follow-up bigger picture question on Part D I guess is do you think that this is a good business and something that you want to be in over time or does the challenge with accurately projecting enrollments and margins change your thinking at all on that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, I think as we have talked about in previous calls, I mean, this has always been an opportunistic business for us. And we have in looking back at the program over since 2006, when we first got into it it\u2019s been a good program for us. The margins clearly in 2014 and what we are looking for in 2015 are what we would prefer and we will continue to evaluate the program as we do every year and see what tweaks and changes we want to make with it.", "Erik Bass", "Okay, thank you for the comments.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner", "Hey, good morning. Thanks. I was interested actually in picking up on some of the yield comments and Gary, if you covered this, I apologize if I missed it. But first of all, where is the portfolio yield coming off now and where is new money coming on just currently not talking about the 2015 guidance, because I have a question on that, but where are you now on those two metrics?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. Randy, for the portfolio yield, at the end of the year it\u2019s 5.89%. And during the year, we invested money at 4.77%, the higher at the full year and then we \u2013 I think we ended up at 4.8% for the quarter.", "Randy Binner", "Okay. So, 4.8% for the quarter and then I guess your kind of spot, you are saying it\u2019s 4.5%, I guess, because if I got that right, in your 2015 guidance, you said you are assuming 4.5% growing to 4.75% basis points, is that right?", "Gary Coleman", "Right, but we\u2019re assuming 4.5% for half the year and 4.75% for the second half of the year.", "Randy Binner", "So, that 4.5% is coming in where, is that is that still A- or you do have to go into the high BBBs to get that?", "Gary Coleman", "It would be in the high BBBs, which is we fluctuate between A- and BBB+. To get to those rates, it would BBBs and BBB+.", "Randy Binner", "Okay. And then on the energy disclosure, I appreciate that, but the one piece I didn\u2019t get and then again I may have missed it, the energy exposure you have currently in the below investment grade area, is what number or percentage?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, out of the $1.5 billion of energy bonds, only $16 million are below investment grade bond \u2013 below investment grade.", "Randy Binner", "Okay, so it\u2019s de minimis?", "Gary Coleman", "It\u2019s de minimis and over \u2013 almost 9% of the bonds are pipelines and exploration production. There is very little in the oil field service or drillers.", "Randy Binner", "Okay, oil service. Okay. I am just going to ask one more, just in case no one hits on it, but I have asked this question I think almost every conference call, but I have been interested to see how well you all have done in improving your sales, while some other direct and kind of let\u2019s call it direct distributors of life, health products, I have struggled because of a better employment environment meaning the folks who take a direct sales job find something else to do in this kind of economy. I would just be interested in your perspective on that of how you have gotten the agent counts up really across the board whether you talk about [indiscernible] American Income or Liberty despite the fact that these targeted individuals assuming they would have other job opportunities, just kind of interested in your color on that dynamic?", "Larry Hutchison", "This is Larry, in all three agencies particular recurring system have enabled us to continue to grow the agent count. We are continually trying to improve those recruiting system and training systems. Additionally in all three agencies we have implemented systems is to really focus on improving agent retention. In answering your question I am less concerned about the general economy, we are really focusing on performance in terms of recruiting and retraining agents.", "Gary Coleman", "And also Randy I would add is in recruiting we are not just recruiting agents to come in and sell insurance. We are recruiting them with the opportunity that they can \u2013 as they grow they can some day head up an office, its own their own business to a certain extent. So I think that helps us.", "Randy Binner", "I guess the quick follow-up is beyond I guess becoming a middle I think you all call middle managers, is there a better \u2013 are using better technology, the processes on the recruiting or what it was \u2013 is it specifically that\u2019s improved there?", "Larry Hutchison", "It\u2019s better technology, but it\u2019s also using different sources of recruiting. Now, internet recruiting has been a strong source for the last 10 years. We have recruited and personally recruiting is another specialized recruiting. I will say the other factor that\u2019s driving agent growth and the companies are focused on middle management Randy is not just recruiting our agents, it\u2019s we promote middle-management and we see that middle-management number increase, more people are coming through and trained in the field.", "Randy Binner", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi. First, I had a question on margins in Liberty National and in the Direct Response businesses, both businesses\u2019 underwriting margins declined sequentially and I think they are the lowest that they have been in the last several years, so maybe if you can discuss what happened there. And then secondly on the producing agent count at Liberty National, obviously it\u2019s going over time, but it did drop on a sequential basis and what caused the drop and what your expectations are for that channel?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. Jimmy let\u2019s talk about the margins first and let\u2019s talk about Liberty National. There are some at Liberty there are unfavorable comparisons not only a quarter, but on the year basis. For example, in the quarter \u2013 fourth quarter we had high quarter in terms of claims this year, last year it was a low quarter. When you look at it for the year, the policy obligation ratio which is the main impact on the margin here it was 39% in 2014 versus 38% in 2013. The 38% is a little bit of an outlier. Those prior two years we were at the 39% level. So we think the 39% level is the \u2013 is appropriate and that\u2019s we have included in our guidance. And then it has the impact on the margins this year 26% versus 27% last year, but if you go back and look at the prior two years we were at that 26% level. So what I am saying is, is I think that where we were in 2014 is more realistic and that\u2019s also where we think we will be going forward both on the policy obligation ratio and the margin. On that Direct Response, we really had two issues to hit us there. The margins were low in Direct Response for the same reason Liberty National higher policy obligation percentage. That policy obligation percentage is high. One, because there is a little bit of a quarterly fluctuation that\u2019s there that we didn\u2019t have in the fourth quarter of last year. But also from our trends, we have seen that the policy obligation percentage is higher in Direct Response versus the prior years. So if you look at year-to-date the policy obligation percentage is 48%, that\u2019s higher than the 46% to 47% we have had in prior years. But we from where our trends are showing we think the 48% is the level not only for this year, but it will be the level we will have next year as well and that\u2019s what we had included in the midpoint of our guidance. Not a big change, but we think it is \u2013 that instead of 46%, 47%, we will be at 48%.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay.", "Larry Hutchison", "So, in the fourth quarter Liberty National agencies were focused on their worksite policy renewals and new sales. The agencies have refocused on recruiting new agents during the first quarter. We don\u2019t expect much growth in agent count during the first quarter, but we do expect to see an increase in agent count quarter-to-quarter for the remainder of 2015. And we believe that producing an agent count at the end of 2015 for Liberty National should be between 1,650 to 1,700 agents.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning gentlemen, go back to the Part D business and maybe better understand what the underlying trends there were. So first you talked about high utilization rates of high cost drugs is this still mostly the Hep C drugs?", "Frank Svoboda", "It does not appear to be with respect to the Hep C drugs at all. In fact, for 2015 and the new drug Harvoni, we feel very comfortable in the pricing that we have in our PBM and as our preferred \u2013 also our preferred pharmacy has been able to negotiate similar rebates and some discounts on those particular drugs in 2015. So we see those as actually being very well taken into account. Just it seems to be across the board just other again there is a myriad of other more just the brand A drugs versus using generic drugs.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And is there something that just kind of creeped up unexpectedly or because ultimately there are generic and brand drugs out there any given year and things like this year in particular seems to be hitting a little more severely?", "Frank Svoboda", "We did see a little bit of that trend moving in that direction towards the end of 2014 with respect to some of our the new enrollees that we had in 2014, that did seem to be a new trend that we did see in 2014 versus in any of our prior years.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And maybe one final question on actually \u2013 specifically to the Hep C, are you assuming that same utilization rate for \u201815 as the one you saw in \u201814?", "Frank Svoboda", "We are assuming actually a pretty high utilization rate and a little bit of an increased rate or continuing an increased rate into 2015.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel", "Hey, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, I guess not to beat a dead horse on Part D, but I am just curious if you are earning 6% to 8% margin and I think the more typical historical margin would have been around 10% give or take, how does that \u2013 what does that do to the ROE on that business?", "Frank Svoboda", "It drives it down, obviously, its interesting ROE on that particular business is the hard one to take a look at because there is actually very little capital that is required to maintain and operate that business. So we don\u2019t tend to look at that on a strictly on ROE basis as much as we are overall looking at our overall margins and overall investment return.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then I understand can you \u2013 I think last quarter you told us that in November of \u201815 you expected to get back from the government I think somewhere slightly north of $100 million in cash, I assume that number is higher now overall?", "Frank Svoboda", "That is correct. It is about $195 million that we are actually set to receive from the government in November 2015.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And\u2026", "Gary Coleman", "John we talked about that in the third quarter, I think we are talking about, it was going to be $165 million, it\u2019s gone from $165 million to $195 million.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then \u2013 and so if I think about a lot of your assumptions that are baked into \u201815 guide and if we just assume they held constant and I am thinking really more about the new money rate and excess investment income, the receipt of that cash towards the end of \u201915 all else equal should that lead us to believe that excess investment income in dollars not per share, but in dollars is likely actually going to be up in \u201816 versus \u201815 even if it\u2019s only modestly?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, I would think so, part of it depends on our experience in Part D for 2015 in terms of how much receivable we have \u2013 that growth from the 2015 business, but as to what we are expecting is it will be less and so therefore I think your assumption is right. We should be able to see a pickup in 2016.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And just \u2013 and then just one quick following up on the Direct Response margin, so I understood your comments on the benefit ratio if I would \u2013 policy obligations divided by premiums maybe 48% is the new normal there, does that mean that the underwriting margin the new normal is more like a 24% give or take margin there too?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, John that\u2019s what \u2013 we are finishing this year right at 24% and in the midpoint of our guidance we are right at 24%.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then just overall that I know it\u2019s only a one point increase in the benefit ratio there, claims ratio, but I am curious as you dissect that whether you have seen any \u2013 whether you can find exactly what\u2019s driving that. And I am really more curious whether it\u2019s a result of I know some time ago you increased policy limits on what you are willing to write face amount I think $100,000 give or take and I am wondering if you are seeing some times \u2013 some poor results there or not?", "Larry Hutchison", "No, John it\u2019s not in the more recent issues. We are seeing this as policies are issued back in early 2000s.", "John Nadel", "Okay.", "Larry Hutchison", "Where the actual claims coming in a little higher than we anticipated at that time.", "John Nadel", "Okay. So it\u2019s aging?", "Larry Hutchison", "Right.", "John Nadel", "Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi, thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I had just a few follow-ups, most of my questions have been asked at this point. American Income producing agent count could seem quite strong, is there some upside perhaps to the sales growth forecast for \u201915 which I believe you kept in that same range of 6% to 10%?", "Larry Hutchison", "Producing agent count at the end of 2015 for American Income should be between 6,800 and 7,000 agents that\u2019s what we used in giving our sales forecast.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. So we don\u2019t want to think about the producing agent count as a leading indicator then of sales growth\u2026?", "Gary Coleman", "As far as the leading indicator, but there is always a lag in sales activity versus agent recruiting and that\u2019s really because sales growth follows agent growth because new agents are generally less productive than veteran agents.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay, understood. And just coming back to the Part D, I just want to clarify one thing because I guess I am a little surprised, the focus on it from the call considering that with change in your margins and the dollar amounts that I believe it\u2019s less than $0.02 a share are you \u2013 if we look back a 6% to 8% margin on, call it, $300 million of premium versus a 10% margin on $180 million of premium. If it\u2019s the same dollar amount, are you basically ambivalent to it? I think you addressed that question earlier on, but the higher premium in force, that doesn\u2019t create a greater capital need. Is that correct?", "Frank Svoboda", "No, that is correct. And what we are pretty focused is what that the net underwriting margin in dollars is that\u2019s adding to our bottom line. As you indicated, I think at the midpoint of our guidance, we have gone from \u2013 on the last call, we had pointed to about $25 million of midpoint as far as underwriting margin is concerned and now we are looking in that $21 million to $23 million range. So, you are right, that\u2019s really the net impact and that\u2019s really where we are focused on.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. Appreciate the clarity. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets.", "Kenneth Lee", "Hi, how is it going? Just had a quick follow-up question on life margins, a while back there was expectation that life margins for Liberty National could get somewhere on the ballpark of 27%, 28% longer term after restructuring towards the variable cost model in American Incomes, just wanted to know whether that is still the case, because it sounds as if it could be close to 26% right now? Thanks.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Kenneth, I think we are expecting 26% and that\u2019s basically what we had in our midpoint of our guidance. So, I think the 27% that we had in 2013 as I mentioned now that is an outlier there. We think that the difference there was really in the policy obligations 38% in 2013 versus 39% in 2014. So, we expect to be in that 26% range. And that should \u2013 it should remain there, plus or minus a little.", "Kenneth Lee", "Got it. For the long-term, right?", "Gary Coleman", "Right.", "Kenneth Lee", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you very much. Good morning. The impact on 2016 from the pension cost and the IT investments, can you give us some sense of that? Is there a kind of one-time hit or will that be flat and therefore less of a margin impact in 2016? How should we think about that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, with respect to the pension, there is a little bit of a larger hit here in 2015 diverse with what would expect to see in 2016, there will still be some carryover effect and some just general higher expenses relating to the new mortality table, a lot of 2016 will depend on what happens with interest rates. Again, the discount rate that\u2019s applicable to our 2015 expense is at 4.23% if we get some relief on the rates where that drifts back up toward 5%, then that\u2019s going to help relieve some of the pressure from the 2016 expense as well, but you shouldn\u2019t see the same magnitude of increase from \u201815 to \u201816 as we saw in \u201814 to \u201815. As far as the IT, go ahead.", "Gary Coleman", "Frank, as far as the \u2013 just the impact of mortality table, not interest rates, over 60% of that like a one-time as we convert everybody over to mortality table as opposed to going forward.", "Frank Svoboda", "That\u2019s correct.", "Mark Hughes", "And then on the IT investments?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. So, on the IT investments, you will continue to see strong increases on that from year-to-year. I would say, the increase has been fairly consistent with what you are seeing from \u201814 to \u201815 largely as we have been making some investments over the past couple of years and the depreciation of those investments are starting to really hit the books here in \u201815 and then we will get some of the added depreciation that we are seeing on our investments here in \u201815, we will start to hit it in \u201816. So, you will continue to see some increases there.", "Mark Hughes", "Then I had just one follow-up. Just kind of any broad thoughts on productivity with the economy perhaps getting a little bit better, a little faster job growth, household formation, et cetera, do think you are seeing a little more appetite for consumers to buy insurance? Should that be meaningful going forward?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think the increased percent of productivity was less related to the economy is more focused on some changes we are making to the American Income and the other distribution. We are implementing some new technology to make agents better at rate mapping. We have new payment systems in place. It\u2019s specifically each agency to improve productivity, so we are less focused on general economy, really focusing on each distribution unit and how do we pick up distribution within each unit.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Just want to follow-up on the IT question, having followed you guys for 34 years I don\u2019t think I have ever seen an admin expense budget of up 7% going into a year. And what are you trying to get from the IT expenses that you are building? Is this catching up to the rest of the world on maintenance or is this taking you to another level as far as on the sales perspective?", "Larry Hutchison", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s catch-up, Bob, I think it\u2019s really making changes in our investment in each agency. And so as you look at really new technology has just become available in the last 24, 36 months. So, the IT changes in the agency system are staying ahead of the curve not to catch-up.", "Frank Svoboda", "And Bob, I would add though, we were \u2013 our administrative expenses were virtually flat for 2014, but we benefited by lower pension expense in 2014 that remember last year at this time, those were higher. That drove the pension expense down, excluding the impact of the benefit we got there, you would have seen growth in our administrative expenses last year.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Got it. Just so I can understand better though, the IT spending, this is going to allow your agents to sell better or how does it work? Is this laptop?", "Larry Hutchison", "It\u2019s not laptop, Bob, it\u2019s our \u2013 we want to talk about rate mapping, I am talking about the recent technology, so it makes agents more efficient. As we put leads into that system, they call on their prospects in order so they spend the least amount of time on the road, more time making presentations. That\u2019s one example. Another is upgrading our compensation systems. As we need to treat our compensation, we can make those changes more quickly and we can respond to the data we are seeing come out of the agencies. Before we need to focus our compensation we focus on recruiting, retention, all of the different metrics we are going to focus on compensation on. So, the technology is really changing quickly in the agency world and we are just trying to be responsive of that and make our agents spend more time in presentations, less time in trying to setup appointments and the time it takes to drive those different appointments.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Is this more of a top-line sales or a margin sort of benefit that you will get from these investments?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think it\u2019s in investments, but over time we are able to grow our sales force.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Is that what you were going to say, Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "No, what I was going to say getting back to the impact on administrative expenses, even with these additional expenses, IT and also the pension expense, our ratio to premium is going to be 5.8%. This year, it\u2019s 5.7%. For 2014, it\u2019s 5.7% but we have been in the 5.8%, 5.9% range. So, these are just reasons expenses are going to be a little bit higher this year, but our overall expense ratio was going to stay where it has been.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. So, part of it is your premiums are growing faster so you can absorb higher admin expenses?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Got it. Thank you.", "Gary Coleman", "Go ahead.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "No, that was it. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz", "Hey, good morning, everybody. Just Larry, could you restate what the AIZ target count is for the agents for the year, you broke up a little bit on the lower end?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, sure. I hope there is distribution given the producing agent count at the end of 2015 for American Income should be 6,800 and 7,000 agents, at Liberty National, the producing agent count at the end of 2015 should be between 1,650 and 1,700 agents and at Family Heritage, at the end of 2015 we expect to have between 840 to 880 agents.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick one, most of my questions have been asked, given the 4.5% targeted new money rate for the first half of the year and then 4.75% for the second half, how should we see the effective portfolio yield come down, how much on a quarterly basis?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, for the year we are \u2013 if we invest at those ranges, we are thinking instead of 5.89% the portfolio will decline \u2013 portfolio yield will decline 10 basis points to 5.79% and 5.80% somewhere in that stakes up. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s even for a quarter but for the year it would be 10 basis points.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay, alright. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We will take our next questions from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Hi, I have a quick couple of follow-ups. You touched upon the energy space at least with regards to investment I was curious if you expected any impact to sales next year given the turmoil in the energy sector?", "Larry Hutchison", "No, we are not expecting any impact on the sales at all from the turmoil in the energy sector.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the pension and then the new mortality tables, I was just curious why those weren\u2019t factored in already at the time of the last \u2013 or when the initial guidance was given on the last call?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. The timing Yaron from the information that had been provided out by the Society of Actuaries I mean there had been some proposals that had been floated around earlier in the year. The final mortality tables and the comments that had been floating around during the year really weren\u2019t available until late in October, the final mortality tables were actually released in October of 2014. So for us to get a reasonable estimate we just did not have a reasonable estimate of what the overall impact of these mortality tables would be on our particular population within our pension plan at the time of the last call.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next questions from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.", "John Nadel", "Hi, just quick follow-up on the higher pension costs, there was some discussion earlier in the Q&A about some portion of it likely more one-time in nature, some portion of it potentially more of an ongoing issue and I know we have to be concerned about what happens with the discount rate, but if \u2013 similar to my last question if we assume no real change on the longer term discount rate on the pension block, looking out to 2016 how do we think about those overall costs?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. John, at this time we don\u2019t have a projection of our 2016 costs, it\u2019s been provided to us that takes into account the full impact of those mortality tables.", "John Nadel", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "So I don\u2019t really have a good number to give you, I don\u2019t anticipate there being a \u2013 that there would not be a similar type increase from what we saw here for \u201915, but we do think the majority of the increase from \u201814 to \u201815 really came from that change in the mortality table, so we wouldn\u2019t expect \u2013 I sure don\u2019t expect a similar increase.", "John Nadel", "Got it. So it should be it should be more of \u2013 in dollar terms there would be expense in \u201916 versus \u201915 should be reasonably similar?", "Frank Svoboda", "Reasonably similar I would think.", "John Nadel", "Yes, okay. But no big step back down unless discount moves?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "John Nadel", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gary Coleman", "Alright. Thank you for joining us this morning. Those were our comments and we will talk to you again next quarter ", "Operator", "And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2014 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Net operating income for the first quarter was $134 million or $1.04 per share, a per share increase of 30% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $122 million or $0.95 per share, a 3% decrease on a per share basis. With fixed maturities and amortized cost, our return on the equity as of March 31, was 14.7% and our book value per share was $28.44, a 7% increase over year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities and market value, book value per share increased 22% to $38.17. In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $513 million, while life underwriting margins were $141 million, up 1% from a year ago.", "Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due to higher claims primarily in direct response. For the full year we expect life underwriting margin to increase 3% to 5% over 2014. Also in the quarter net life sales increase 17% to $104 million. On the health side premium revenue grew 4% to $229 million and health underwriting margin grew 4% to $52. For the full year we expect health underwriting margin to increase 2% to 4%. Health sales increased 2% to $32 million excluding groups business, individual health sales increased 22%.", "Administrative expenses were $47 million for the quarter, up 7% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary increase reason for the increase is administrative expenses are higher pension and IT cost. As a percentage of premiums, administrative expenses were 5.7% compared to 5.6% a year ago. For the full year we anticipate that administrative expenses will be up around 6% to 7% and around 5.8% of premium. I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. We are very pleased about sales activity at Torchmark. We have had year-over-year increases in net life sales in each of our major life distribution channels for five quarters in a row. Now I will go over the results for each company. At American income life premiums were up 9% to $202 million. Life underwriting margin was up 4% to $62 million. Net life sales were $47 million, up 24% due primarily to increase agent accounts. The average agent counts for the first quarter was 6,317 up 19% over a year ago, but a price for the same as the fourth quarter. Our producing agent count at the end of the first quarter were 6,541. We expect life sales growth for the full year 2015 to be within a range of 9% to 13%. Our Direct Response Operations at Globe Life, life premiums were up 5% to $187 million. But life underwriting margin declined to 5% to $43 million net life sales were up 11% to $45 million. We expect 4% to 7% life sales growth for the full year 2015. ", "At Liberty National life premiums were $68 million, down 1% from a year ago. Our life underwriting margin was $17 million same as the year ago quarter. Net life sales grew 16% to $9 million, while net health sales increased 8% to $4 million. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,464 up 5% from a year ago but down 7% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,544. Life net sales growth is expected to within a range of 6% to 9% for the full year 2015. Health net sales growth is expected within a range of 4% to 7% for the full year 2015. At Family Heritage our premiums increased to 8% to $54 million our health underwriting margin increased 6% to $11 million, health net sales were up 18% to $12 million. ", "The average producing agent account for the first quarter was 784 up 19% from a year ago but approximately same as the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 881. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 7% to 10% for the full year 2015. ", "At United American General Agency count premiums increased 6% to $83 million. Net health sales declined from $14 million to $12 million. Excluding our group business net health sales grew at 30%. For the full year 2015 we expect growth on individual sales be around 15% to 20%. As we discussed last quarter we expect lower group sales in 2015, due to unusual number of large group cases we acquired in 2014. Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 4% to $79 million, while the underwriting margin declined from $10 million to $5 million. Decline in underwriting margin was in line with our expectations, was due to the increase in part D drug cost discussed on our previous call. We expect Part D premium of 310 million to 320 million for the full year 2015. Expect margin as a percentage of premium to be approximately 6% to 8%. I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income, excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on policy liabilities and debt was $55 million, a decline of 3% from the first quarter 2014. On a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%. We have discussed on previous call the effect of Part D on excess investment income. Excess investment income is negatively impacted by Part D to the excess of $2 million in the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of Part D excess investment income would have been flat with the year ago quarter, but up about 5% on per share basis. For the full year 2015 we expect excess investment income to decrease by about 1% to 3% however on a per share basis we should see an increase of about 2% to 3%. At the midpoint of our 2015 guidance we're expecting to drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $7 million. ", "Regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $13.5 billion, including $13 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $12.4 billion our investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $604 million compared to $552 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.7% compare to 4.4% a year ago. With the portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains from fixed maturities, is 17%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, the same as the year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in a fixed maturity portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $256 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter. ", "To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I would like to address our investments in the energy sector. We believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. Over 96% of our energy holdings are investment grade. At the end of first quarter, our energy portfolio had a net unrealized gain of $173 million. That\u2019s an 8% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. And we have reviewed our energy holdings and have concluded that while we may see some downgrades, we believe that the companies we have invested in can withstand lower oil prices for an extended duration.", "Regarding the investment yield in the first quarter we invested $292 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in industrial sectors. We invested an average of yield of 4.5% and average rating of triple BBB+ and an average life of 29 years. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 5.87%, down 5 basis point from the 592 yield in the first quarter of 2014. At March 31, 2015, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.86%. The midpoint of our guidance for 2015 assumes new money yield of 4.5% for the second quarter and 4.75% for the last two quarters of the year. One last thing on past analyst call as we have discussed in detail the impact of the lower for longer interest rate environment. As a reminder an extended lower interest rate environment impacts our income statement the not the balance sheet. This we primarily sale non-interest system protecting power accounted for under [file] \u201916, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we did not foresee a negative impact on our balance sheet. While we were definitely benefitted from higher interest rates Torchmark will continue to earn unsubstantial excess investment net income and the expanded loan interest environment. ", "Now, I will turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda ", "Thanks, Gary. First I would like to briefly discuss a few items impacting our 2015 earnings guidance. As Gary mentioned growth in the life underwriting income lagged behind the growth and premium in the first quarter primarily due to higher policy obligations in our direct response operations. In the first quarter of this year policy obligations that had direct response were 49.1% of premiums versus 46.9% in the first quarter of 2014 looking back the first quarter of last year was low as the policy obligations for the full year 2014 ended up at 48.1%. As we discussed on our last call this percentage was trending higher than prior years primarily due to actual claims coming in higher than our expectations on policy just issued in the early 2000. We also noted that we expected the policy obligation percentage for 2015 to be around 48%. Based on the additional claims experience we found the first quarter and further review of the emerging claims trends we now believe the direct response policy obligations for the full year 2015 would be in the range of 48.5% to 49% of premiums.", "This increase in the expected policy obligation of direct response is the primary driver of the $0.2 reduction in the midpoint of our guidance. In addition, we revised our expectations for the Canadian foreign exchange rate which have cause the earnings from American income life to be somewhat lower than previously anticipated. On a positive note we do anticipate our premium income will be higher than previously estimated primarily at American Income due to the strong first quarter sales. The net effect of these three items results in the reduction in the midpoint of our guidance from $4.30 and to $4.28. ", "Now regarding our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter we spent 90 million to buy1.7 million towards Torchmark shares and an average price of $53.20. So far in April we have used $18 million to purchase 328,000 shares. For the full year through to date we have spent 108 million of parent company cash to acquire 2 million shares at an average price of $53.57. The parent start of the year with liquid assets to $57 million. In addition, to these liquid assets the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2015. Free cash flow results primarily from the difference receive by the parent from the subsidiaries unless the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be around 360 million that's included in the 57 million available from assets on hand we currently expect to have around $417 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. As previously noted to date we have used $108 million of this cash to buy 2 million Torchmark shares. Leaving around $309 million of cash and other liquids assets available for the remainder of the year. As noted before we will use our cash as efficiently as possible if market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those of funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets at the parent company.", "Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital to level necessary to retain our current ratings in the last two years that level has been around an IAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but it's efficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As of December 31, 2014 our consolidated RBC was 327% we do not anticipate any significant changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2015. Those are my comments.", "I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2015, we expect our net operating income to be within the range of $4.20 per share to $4.36 per share, a 6% increase over 2014 at the midpoint. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question today from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The margins in the business you had addressed your Direct Response margins, but as I look at American Income the margins there were a lot weaker than they been in a while as well. So maybe talk about what caused that and what your expectations are? And then secondly on growth in the agent count, the average agents were down but the ending number was actually higher across all channels, so just wondering if you could describe a little bit what you're doing in each of the businesses -- each of the channels than what your expectations for growth in the agent count are?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay I'll go first on the America income margins. The margins at American income were little bit -- underwriting margins were a little lower than anticipated but it's because we had, as we've mentioned higher claims, but if you look at the -- it's more of a timing thing, if you go back and look at the fourth quarter of last year the claims were low and they were 31% of premium. This quarter they're 33%. We're expecting 32% for the year, so it would maybe think that it's just the timing. We think that the margin, we had 31.7% underwriting margin in 2014 and we're expecting to go about that same margin for 2015.", "Larry Hutchison", "The agents count, we saw the increase in agent recruiting and better agent retention in each of the distribution units as we moved through the first quarter. The trend after the first quarter has been positive. We continue to see a strong agent recruiting and better retention in the each of the distribution units", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then just one more on capital, your RBC obviously is lower than other companies but the business flex different as well, a while ago S&B had these issues about just preferred stock and how they're going to -- they potentially might changes the treatment of those, have you had any discussions with them and order your view on the potential for that and how that would affect your capital management strategy?", "Gary Coleman", "Sure, Jimmy, we have not had any recent discussions with them with regard to that. At the time we that we had last fall when we had our initial discussions, it was contemplation that there would sometime to address the situation and really looking at within couple of years and so we instead really talked about some of the prior calls, we're really taking a look at our various options and really don't have any update as far as what we're going to do or how we're going to address that going forward. I think the bottom line is we don't thing at this point in time that we need to or that any resolution to the issue would impact our stock buyback. We think we can address the issue through other forms of financing, another options that we would have available and so we probably and so we probably would look maybe towards latter part of this year or first part of the next year to really get some resolution to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Citigroup.", "Erik Bass", "Hi, thank you. I just want to touch first on Direct Response margins and I think when you've talked about it in the past you said that I think pressure point in margins was sort of isolated towards older block, if you could just maybe size -- what the size of that older block is and at first anything that you're seeing there that you think might also be relevant to other pieces or other vintages of the Direct Response business?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, Erik, on last call we discussed, it's a block of business that was written over 10 years ago and the clients are coming little bit higher than expected. Now as far as the size of that block, it's currently about -- if you look at total Direct Response for you that block is about 18% of premium, but it's declining about 6% to 7% a year and so as it continues to decline and as we add new business, combination of those two things will make the impact of that block on the policy obligations going forward. It will be declined or less the impact as we go forward.", "Erik Bass", "Got it and is there anything unique about that block that you've identified that will cause the margin profile to be different?", "Larry Hutchison", "Not anything in particular, it's certain, it's in those products that we settle and so we've taken a look at that, we haven't seen anything that is troublesome there, but we'll say this our current pricing, our pricing the last few years we feel is adequate to point we won't have this problem going forward.", "Erik Bass", "Great, thank you, and just one last question on your sales guidance changes, are those mainly just to reflect sort of where you've seen stronger recruiting it American Income then you\u2019d expected. And I think that was probably the biggest change for, you've raised the sales guidance there?", "Gary Coleman", "That's the American Income making a stronger agent recruiting, agent intention earlier than anticipated and that\u2019s reflected in our guidance.", "Operator", "We'll now to go Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Seth Weiss", "Just a question on margins again, did you see any weakness due to more severe flu season if you have any comments on that that would be helpful.", "Gary Coleman", "No we really haven\u2019t seen any impact to that.", "Seth Weiss", "Follow up on Eric's question in terms of American income increase sales guidance. The agent recruiting obviously has a go forward benefit. First quarter sales seemed particularly strong, was that significantly higher than what you are expectations were? And how much that lead to the increased sales guidance?", "Frank Svoboda", "So we probably had strong recruiting and then increase in agent count in the third and fourth quarter, we think sales will improve in part because the agent recruiting the last half of 2014 have gained experience and become more productive.", "Operator", "And Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets is next.", "Randy Binner ", "I guess just a couple on the agent count. So one would be, you mentioned agent retention improving in a couple of [tons]. I was wondering possible for you to quantify how that got better than wherever it was before. And then on the data that\u2019s been provided now on the average producing agent count. I was just curious was that it was flat on a linked quarter basis meaning in first quarter '15 relative to fourth quarter '14. Is that a normal first quarter versus fourth quarter dynamic if you look back at that data set historically?", "Larry Hutchison", "Its look that\u2019s really agent increase first of all I think the strength of the American income as we've increased our agent activity through better training, new technology. And as you have higher agent activity of a better retention rate because the agent are making more money and they stay with agent's longer.", "Gary Coleman", "As far as the average agent counts we've really going to started putting that information together in the first quarter last year. But I think what -- based on as trend I think what we were seeing is that average agent count for the first quarter not be lower than the fourth quarter in prior years because we generally -- the later of part of the fourth quarter and past years is a pretty low in terms of recruiting. As Larry we have a strong third and fourth quarter recruiting so we either stay at about the same level I think is the improvement. I don\u2019t have the exact numbers , but that\u2019s the way the agents [indiscernible].", "Larry Hutchison", "Experience, Gary because of holidays in each of the distribution units.", "Randy Binner", "Yes, that was my question because we don\u2019t have data either and so that helps explain it just normal seasonality recruiting and then but back to retention again, any quantification there on how much better it is now versus before? However you guys measure that internally. ", "Larry Hutchison", "We measured internally and we checked it on the monthly basis as we check for cash and it\u2019s like thirteenth month retention. It's one of the factor, we've had higher agent activity which means we have more submitting agent, so it\u2019s not just agent retention its greater activity related to our greater percentage of agents that submit every week and that results in higher retention for us. I don\u2019t want to misled is just retention is driving the increase sales. It's a combination of better training, better recruiting, our focus on retention, it\u2019s changing our compensation models to drive those behaviors. ", "Randy Binner", "So just on the yield assumption for the second half 475 basis points. How long can you stick with that before having to revisit it.", "Gary Coleman", "We'll keep looking at it as we go forward that\u2019s not something we're just sticking to because we want to. We're looking at the, all the projections of somewhat treasure rates are going be. We're looking at the consensus and treasury rates and where we think spread will fall in. Right now we're comfortable with the four and three quarter but that\u2019s something we revisit constantly.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Have couple of questions, one on the revised sales guidance. Seems like in Directly Response Life and also in Liberty National you're actually lowering the top end of the guidance despite very strong first quarter sales. So I was wondering if you could maybe give a little more color say what was behind that. ", "Gary Coleman", "We did have a strong first quarter in Direct Response, but we\u2019re starting to get again stronger quarter in the second, third and fourth quarter 2014. So I think that reflects the sales guidance for the whole year being in the range of 4% to 7%. ", "Yaron Kinar", "So would that mean that initially you'd expected recent even stronger quarter in the first quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "I'll say the first quarter from a litter stronger on side with growth of the first quarter. For each of these agencies and for Direct Response you go back to 2014 you saw that was significant increase in our net sales in the ,second third and fourth quarter. We\u2019ll be measuring against those quarters as we go forward. ", "Yaron Kinar", "And then with regards to agent growth, family heritage clearly showed a very significant improvement in the first year agents or is there anything in particular that drove that?", "Gary Coleman", "We didn't have the recruiting push, just a focus on recruiting. Basically the benefit is to use our internet recruiting, it is now up 25% and the recruit over 400% which is personal recruits. So that's been a plus at family heritage and we\u2019ve managed new agencies are coming here and regionally showing the positive impact of an increased number of agencies at the family heritage system.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And a quick numbers question I know it\u2019s on the balance sheet, the cash number was actually quite low, about 3 million always there anything in particular going on there and should we expect that to increase?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes I think that is just I think just a quarterly fluctuation and then just kind of the timing issue with respect to the end of particular quarter. I do think that it is on a normal basis would be a little bit higher than that, just happen to hit both [indiscernible] during the quarter.", "Operator", "And will go John Nadel with Piper Jaffrey.", "John Nadel", "Hi, good morning. Just a question about the level of life insurance sales production in particular and maybe health sales too. I guess it's sort of an issue that we haven't really had to grapple with for some time in this high quality issue. I mean how strong do life sales have to be before it actually does negatively impact your expectation for free cash flow generation IE you need more capital to support the fact that your growing faster than you might have otherwise expected to grow.", "Larry Hutchison", "John this is Larry, your questions are little hard for us to hear, but I think your question was as we see higher life sales what impact does it have on our capital requirements and then turn on our free cash flow, was that your question?", "John Nadel", "Yes I'm sorry if that was little bit difficult to hear, yes it's essentially right along those lines Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Okay. Gary?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes you are seeing a drag on the one of the reasons why statutory income is actually down from \u201814 and \u201813 and you are seeing a little bit of the decrease in the cash -- in our free cash flows in expectations for 2015 versus 2014 really is resolve of several of those strong sales that we had in 2014. Those new create statutory drag at the current levels and I mean we\u2019re happy to have those strong sales and at current drag, but I think that with the level of sales that we're seeing you will see kind of the flattening of that free cash flow for the next -- for as long we continue to have the sales kind of see that whereas filtering in just kind of having free on of flat free cash flows.", "Larry Hutchison", "John, I would add to that is that I would probably still have a first year of drag, but since we get into the second we start turning into -- now we have set for a positive cash positive drag, so it's at a great price it can be a temporary drag but so we want to put as much business on the books as we can. That generates the -- we won't grow the in-force and of course -- because of the high underwriting that we had that also grow to free cash in future.", "John Nadel", "Yes I don't think it wrong I like what you said high quality problem right. Can you remind us how fast on the statutory basis you are license showing sales, let say sales in year one, at what point do you get back to sort of the cumulative break even on the statutory basis?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes I think, John, I think it's in about somewhere in that 6 to 8 year time frame.", "John Nadel", "Okay and maybe another high quality issue that we've talked about in the past given the stock price, price to both multiple, price to earnings multiple I guess there has been one or two occasions over Torchmark public, publicly traded life were it felt like the share price was approaching your own internal view of embedded value or whatever they say exactly that you guys calculate but how do you, are there any sort of updated thoughts alone those lines? I know you've talked about shareholders really liking the buyback over a significant increase in your dividend yield, as an example.", "Gary Coleman", "Well John, what we\u2019re said in the past is that we think that at some consolidated value we will stop the share, more marketing stop the share repurchase. But our objective is to get cash back to the shareholders so we will probably move that into something of a dividend -- special dividend or whatever. But yes we\u2019re trying to get this towards the higher side of the price of book for Torchmark, but still if as we\u2019ve talked about before we had to recalculate what we think that intrinsic value is of -- and what are we looking at and we\u2019re liking in the market variety and look at it over trends over a period of time. We still don't think we at a point where buying the shares at too high price and thus we anticipate continuing to buy the shares, but that's something that we're committed to returning the gain access to shareholder, but we're not going to dilute the shares, so we don't think we're there yet, we'll continue to follow in a week, if we get that point, then we'll consider doing probably a special cash dividend.", "Operator", "We'll go to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz", "Frank, can you kind of give us I guess, did you know the effect of the Canadian dollar both on the change in premium in force for the life business between yearend and quarter end and maybe talk about how that might be playing into new sales guidance?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, that's sure, but I have to quite to breakdown exactly the quarter versus the yearend, but if you recall we -- it's the average rate that works in overtime that impacts the actual amount of reported premium and as well as the reported underwriting from those premiums. In 2014, we had an average exchange rate of about 90.7% and we're anticipating now that the average rate for all of 2015 would be around 80%. And so that's based upon -- we have Canadian premium of around in Canadian dollars a little over $90 million. Roughly for the full year 2015, roughly a $10 million impact on American Income's reported premium.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "Now for the first quarter of the year, the average exchange rate was around 88%. So that's one of the things that kind of a continuing impact, we didn't really see that much of a drag on first quarter earnings as results of the near the lower foreign exchange rate, but you'll see a continuing drag over the course of the year as long as -- assuming that the existing in the current rates stay there, the exchange rates stay in place for the remainder of the year.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay thank you that will be useful. And then little bit of one-off maybe the Doc Fix for Medicare, this is a few years away but the Doc Fix includes a proposal to do away with first dollar med supp, I am wondering if that's an important product for you?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's really going to kick in with regard the med supp policies in 2020 and what they're looking right now is the reduction incenting our first dollar coverage, but primarily with the hospital elimination of the Part D deductible. I mean we still maintain that it's not affecting our current policyholders and it's hard to estimate, it's hard to know exactly what other changes there might be going down the road and future budget talks or further Medicare reform, but that is something that we are watching very closely.", "Steven Schwartz", "Is it a large part of your business currently, your sales currently?", "Frank Svoboda", "The Medicare supplement, I mean on that?", "Steven Schwartz", "First dollar med supp?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, first dollar med supp, that's going to be med supp products are.", "Steven Schwartz", "All your med supp products are first dollar?", "Frank Svoboda", "Larry do you want to comment on that?", "Larry Hutchison", "Where you're trying to deductible reach, when you define high first dollar med sup, we have to be careful on how we define it because it is different level of coverage on med supp. We tend to sell the higher deductible med supp products, it's so far out, Brian, it's really difficult to give guidance at this in 2015 for something that might, maybe I could in 2016, certainly now in 2015 --.", "Frank Svoboda", "Between now 2020.", "Steven Schwartz", "When we were considering first dollar coverage plan, I mean generally what that means plans that cover almost all deductibles and co-pays, is that that what's your referring to?", "Steven Schwartz", "Yes, I also number the plans they were talking about, it was two special plans that they were referring, but I don't remember what the letters were. I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "Frank Svoboda", "I mean I have to look into specifics more closely, but I mean reading that act, the macro it references the first dollar coverage and specifically the Part D deductible, but again that's not going to take place for five years and so we're not anticipating any of that now, but that is something that we're monitoring and looking at very closely.", "Operator", "We will go [indiscernible] with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I had a couple of questions, first with respect to the average policy size you're selling now, clearly been very successful as recruiting as and much stronger than I think most of your peers. Are you starting to move up the average policy size and thinking I guess on average is well about 30,000 and is around 17 is that starting to trend up is the first question.", "Second question is they can turn back on the capital issue, unless I\u2019m mistaken, I do believe SMP with the changes for the capital model has Torchmark on criteria watch. And if you can perhaps elaborate on what the issue is that they're looking at and how that may impact potentially on buyback. And the next one would be as you well aware the NAIC is changing the base factors on fixed income securities this year. I had heard that on average RBCs are going down about 50 point from the NAIC. I would think that\u2019s probably about fair estimate for Torchmark and I would assume that based on what you said that you don\u2019t want your RBC sort of really dropping much below 325. So again what are you going to be doing to start address that? Thank you. ", "Larry Hutchison", "This is Larry, I\u2019ll address the agency question first. In terms of size of the policy we're seeing some impact in the American Income. We talked last year about introducing our new senior life sales and the average premium for senior life products is $720 versus the average premium for non-senior life product is about $470. So there assuming the difference that\u2019s a percentage of our sales of senior life has increase from 15% to 20%. American business we've seen a positive impact for the size, but I think the real change in the industry is not in the size of the premium model or the base amount.", "I think what really what\u2019s impacting is the strong leadership we have our agencies. From a home office perspective we have very strong leadership in American Income, Liberty National, and Family Heritage have also strong leadership in the field and the owners of those agencies, the SGAs, the sales directors, provider with the ideas for better training, better technology and they work with their whole office staff and I think that\u2019s where the impact is, they worked together in 2014. We're seeing the benefit of those actions in 2015. ", "Gary Coleman", "You're asking about average stake amount, it varies by company, but American over $40,000 average base amount. What we're seeing a new increase really in the base amount is Direct Response. The Direct Response is been lower than the 40,000, in the past we're starting to sell some higher based amounts up to 100,000 and that we see it hasn\u2019t been a dramatic increase yet, but we are seeing an increase there. But still when you compare to other companies, our prices amounts are pretty low. American income around -- a little over 40,000 and in globe is still under that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's not build like much \u201817 [indiscernible], but I just trying to get, if the success you had in recruiting and I think we got the answer to that, is also sort of flowing through to success in higher phased amount, higher premium amount. So it's not just you're adding more agents. But you really are adding more productive and I assume more profitable agent, so that\u2019s a fair way to [indiscernible].", "Gary Coleman", "Rather effective at the start of 2014 was growth in middle management. We saw growth in middle management in each of our sales system and in each of our agencies. You should grow your middle management, you have better training. Those middle manager are then recruiter, sends another positive impact from 2014, as follow through the 2015.", "Larry Hutchison", "Frank you want to handle the RBC question?", "Frank Svoboda", "So I'll touch on the SMP issue first and you are right, the SMP is perfect places to find negative outlook last fall. It's really based upon their view of certain inner company preferred stock that is part of our insurance company's capital structure. This preferred stock has been in place since 1998 and then has not really changing in a substantial level since that period of time.", "But the SMP in there adoption of -- they don\u2019t look at RBC they have their own capital model and basically there was a just a change in view on their part on how much credit they wanted to get that\u2019s with respect to that preferred stock. And so with respect to and again they want to give us a little bit or some less credit than what we're getting into our RBC model. So we are taking a look at different options that we have with respect to address the additional capital that they would like to see within the insurance company.", "And we're taking a look at whether we want to if we\u2019re interested in keeping our SMP rating. We also do recognize that the SMP is not that critical or isn\u2019t critical at all from our marketing efforts. And that we probably tend to one notch above many of our peers with respect to -- at least a one notch down grade should we have one, it really wouldn\u2019t be that costly from perspective and so we are looking at different methods to cure that and it might take different forms of financing and also maybe we\u2019ll end have having a little bit more external financing and replace some of that preferred stock -- intercompany preferred stock that is currently down in insurance company, really don\u2019t see that having any impact on the RBC within the company's, it may in fact improve it to some degree.", "With respect to the bonds and the initiative going on at TNIC it is something that we\u2019ve been watching. The information that I have is that it\u2019s truly not going to for the most part [befalling] it, not until 2017 or 2018. If once it\u2019s fully implemented it definitely could have some meaningful impact on how we think about the capital and at some of our RBC levels, we don't see it having any impacts on us from 2015. But I don' t have any numbers in front of me here hear that would indicate that exactly what that would be, other than it's definitely something that we\u2019ll have to watch a year or two down the road.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, just come back on S&P for a second, what I had seen as you did going criteria watch and that\u2019s it, going to make it outlook -- but criteria watch when they announce the capital model changes towards the end of March and my understanding of that process is somewhat mechanical but it's going to get result in the next six months, or I\u2019ll say it could take some [Indiscernible] action. Now you mentioned on the preferred I guess it was might be helpful for all, is how much are they actually talking about in terms of dollars, because I do appreciate [indiscernible] It is something that\u2019s got a dollar cost to it, they are looking for XML, that if you add that to the capital structure I assume the writing will say this is what it is. So if could just maybe put a number on it because it does seem to me that this is something that's got to get result but at the end of the third quarter.", "Frank Svoboda", "Well I don't think I don't think that is some of that we have to have for the additional amount of capital resolved by the end of the third quarter we will have discussions with them, that are kind of a normally schedule discussions sometime in the later part of the second or likely the third quarter that will be talking about that. The total amount of preferred stock that is in the insurance companies is around 300 million but that is not an amount that we believe in the -- that has to be replace in its entirety and so the numbers that we think we would have to do to address the situation are is much less than that. But again as we're looking through the options not really at a point to say exactly what we think we would have to replace that with.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay and I guess the final clarifications is just to be certain. Does [indiscernible] use any sort of captive reinsurance, the fund held in reserves and/or [indiscernible]. ", "Larry Hutchison", "Not the later, we do have an off shore captive insurance company that does seed some redundant reserves. They are not Triple X or A triple X reserves, they\u2019re just not economic results that we are require to hold that at -- of our company and we do reinsure a couple of 100 million dollars of that.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay. Thank you, I suspect that a criteria watch issue. But thanks very much.", "Operator", "And will now go to Eric Brook with RBC capital markets.", "Eric Brook", "I wanted to start with Globe, are you in effect saying that the business was effectively and modestly more underpriced than you had thought it was when you first approached this topic last year.", "Larry Hutchison", "I'm sorry could you just repeat the question. ", "Eric Brook", "Sure, you've discussed the fact that underwriting profitability, I believe you are saying at globe, please correct me if I don't have that right; is not as great as you thought and in particular are you saying that's it's just modestly worst then you thought it would be when you first approach the topic of this older [indiscernible] business several quarters ago?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes as [price] mentioned looking at premiums we had -- instead of being our -- the total policy responsible for this entire grid response unit, instead of being 48%, we\u2019re expecting it to be more 48.5% to 49% and again it is due primarily to this older block of business, is they the clients are coming in on that block.", "Eric Brook", "My second questions relates to Family Heritage. It's clear that you had a sharp increase in recruiting, as we think about all of the measures that look quite, strong growth in premiums, strong growth in sales, strong growth in force. It is you just about the fact that you have a lot more people selling your product these days or is it more going on at Family Heritage that would explain the very healthy increase in all of the major measures of corporate performance at this company?", "Gary Coleman", "Fairly Heritage is driven primarily by an increasing number of agents and want to caution that those additional agents, I would expect that they will wright in lower weekly premiums than experienced agents, but additional, this will result in overall premium growth for Family Heritage. ", "Eric Brook", "Is that connected to that -- sorry please continue.", "Gary Coleman", "I see that productivity as much as I see a greater number of agents, providing business at Family Heritage.", "Eric Brook", "If I could just sneak in one more quick one, as we continue to monitor the study of the data that you report out in of our your supplementary pages on agent count, I'd be curious to know how you look at those data, do you -- are you interested in the relationship between say renewal agent and the total the idea of being the first year agents tend to be not nearly just productive as renewal agents? Are you looking at the total number, what would you -- what numbers would you encourage readers of your financial statements to really hone in on or ratios on that page showing the agent count?", "Gary Coleman", "Two things that we focused on is the average agent count is indicative of what production was for the quarter, as we've provided ending agent count I guess some indicator of what's going to happen on this subsequent quarter in terms of new samples, for the mix of first year agents versus renewal agents is a concern, you -- on February you\u2019ve seen some improvements and that ratio, but the two primary focus points are average count and ending count in terms of an indicator of where we are going with that recruiting.", "Operator", "At this time, there is one name remaining in the roaster, [Operator Instructions] and we'll now go to Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes", "I am sorry if you touched on this earlier but could you talk about trends in policy retention with the good strong growth in the life sales lately, has there been any impact on retention any new initiatives or sustained initiatives internally that will influenced that going forward?", "Larry Hutchison", "Mark this is Larry. I think the one concern we had as we look at Liberty National, we saw little decrease in agent retention as we just look further in that item. It really was some specific agencies that we're addressing the Liberty National. We have a conservation person in the agency and she's at the agencies we don't think there will be decline within. We'll see normal persistency or cancellation rates within that agency.", "Gary Coleman", "As far as if you could look at the policy lapse rates, we\u2019re continuing to see improvement in our lapse rates, we've talked about conservation program and its continuing to improving there. We're expecting to conserve a little over 18% of policies that laps this year versus this just three years ago, it was or five years ago it was like 5%. We're continuing to find the new ways to conserve policies that had lapsed or about lapse, so we feel very good about where we're with our conservation programs, I know that they are doing a really good job and we think that we will continue to see improvement in the conservation. So that's a good sign as we\u2019ve mentioned in our production grows as we put the conversation, I think we'll see further improvements in our lapse rates.", "Larry Hutchison", "Mark this is Larry again, if I meant strong, I may have said agent retention, I was talking about policy retention, with that. We talked about agent retentions, so I may be used that term but certainly that delivery is actually what policy retention and it\u2019s been addressed.", "Operator", "And there are no other questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike Majors for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "Okay, thank you for joining is this morning.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2014 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "Then, I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the second quarter was $133 million or $1.05 per share, a per share increase of 30% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $1 per share, a 2% decrease on a per share basis. With fixed maturities and amortized cost, our return on the equity as of June 30 was 14.7% and our book value per share was $28.91, a 7% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $33.94 approximately the same as a year ago.", "In our Life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5.7% to $520 million while life underwriting margin was $139 million, down 1% from a year ago. Despite the growth in premium, underwriting margin declined primarily due to higher claims in Direct Response. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 1% to 3% over 2014. Life sales increased 6% to $108 million.", "On the Health side, premium revenue grew 8% to $232 million and health underwriting margin grew 4% to $52 million. The growth in underwriting margin lagged the growth in premium due to the large amount of group business added in 2014 which has lower margins than our other health business.", "For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to increase 2% to 4%. Health sales increased 8% to $31 million.", "Administrative expenses were $47 million for the quarter, up 3% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 5.7% the same as a year ago. For the full year, we anticipate that administrative expenses will be up around 6% to 7% and around 5.8% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. I will now go over the results for each company. At American Income life premiums were up 9% to $207 million and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $64 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 13% due primarily to increased agent counts. The average agent count for the second quarter was 6,603, up 15% over a year ago and up 5% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 6,516. We expect life sales growth for the full year 2015 to be within the range of 11% to 13%. ", "Our Direct Response operations at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $188 million, but life underwriting margin declined 16% to $37 million. Net life sales were flat at $45 million. We expect 4% to 6% life sales growth for the full year 2015.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million, approximately the same as a year ago. Our life underwriting margin was $18 million, down 3% from the year ago quarter. Net life sales grew 6% to $9 million. Our net health sales increased 4% to $4 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,550, up 4% from a year ago and up 6% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,550.", "Life net sales growth is expected to within a range of 5% to 7% for the full year 2015. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2015.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased to 8% to $55 million while health underwriting margin increased 5% to $11 million. Health net sales were up 4% to $13 million.", "The average producing agent account to the second quarter was 960, up 27% from a year ago and up 22% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 969. We expect health sales growth to be within a range from 8% to 10% for the full year 2015.", "At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 16% to $88 million. Net health sales increased from $9 million to $10 million. Individual sales grew 21% to $7 million while group sales declined 6% to $2.8 million. For the full year 2015, we expect growth in individual sales to be around 15% to 20%. As we discussed last quarter, we expect lower group sales in 2015 due to the unusual number of large group cases we acquired in 2014.", "Premium revenue from Medicare part D declined 11% to $75 million, while the underwriting margin declined from $9 million to $5 million. The decline in underwriting margin was in line with our expectations, was due to the increase in Part D drug cost discussed our previous call. We expect Part D premiums of $305 million to $315 million for the full year 2015. Expect margin as a percentage of premium to be approximately 6% to 8%.", "I'll now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I will spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income, less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $57 million, approximately the same as the second quarter of 2014.", "On a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 5%. We have discussed on previous calls the effect of Part D on excess investment income. Excess investment income was negatively impacted by Part D to the extent of $2 million in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of Part D, excess investment income would have been at 2% compared to the year ago quarter and up about 7% on a per share basis.", "For the full year 2015, we expect excess investment income to decline by about 1% to 2%; however, on a per share basis we should see an increase of about 3% to 4%. At the midpoint of our 2015 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $13.6 billion, including $13.1 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. As of the fixed maturities, $12.5 billion our investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $580 million compared to $563 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4%, the same as a year ago.", "With the portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 16%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as the year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in a fixed maturity portfolio of $1 billion, approximately $935 million lower than at the end of the first quarter. The decline in unrealized gains were generated by higher interest rates, not by concerns over credit quality.", "Due to the recent events in Greece, I'd like to everyone of our limited exposure there. We have no direct exposure to Greek sovereign debt and we have no exposure to companies that do business primarily in Greece. We don\u2019t expect to realize any losses should Greece exit the Euro zone.", "To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I'd like to address our investments in the energy sector. I believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. Over 96% of our energy holdings are investment grade. At the end of second quarter, our energy portfolio had net unrealized gain of $69 million. Less than 8% of our energy holdings are in the oilfield service and drilling sector. We have reviewed our energy holdings and concluded that while we may see some downgrades we believe that the companies we invest in can withstand low prices for an extended duration.", "Now to investment yield, in the second quarter we invested $250 in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial and financial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.7%, an average rating of A- and an average life of 30 years. For the entire portfolio second quarter yield was 5.85%, down 7 basis points from the 5.92% yield in the second quarter of 2014. At June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.83%.", "The midpoint of our guidance for 2015 is same as the new money yield of 5.0% for the two quarters of the year. And one last thing. We are encouraged by the potential for higher interest rates. As discussed previously on analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflects it on the balance sheet as we would not expect to convert them to realized losses. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments through maturity.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Frank to discuss share repurchases and capital.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. First, I'd like to briefly discuss a few items impacting our 2015 earnings guidance. As Gary mentioned, growth in life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium in the second quarter due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. In the second quarter this year, policy obligations at Direct Response were 52% of premiums versus 49.1% in the first quarter and 48.1% for all of 2014.", "As discussed on our last call, we thought the percentage would trend higher during 2015 and be around 49% for the year primarily due to anticipated higher claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007. With claims data through June 30, we are now seeing higher claims than anticipated on policies issued in 2011 through 2013 as these policies exit a two-year contestability period.", "Beginning in 2011, we introduced the use of prescription drug database information into our underwriting procedures for certain adult policies with an expectation that our mortality experience would be better on such policies than historical experience. While actual mortality related to policies issued in 2011 through 2013 has not been greater than historical levels, they are higher than we assumed when the policies were issued. Approximately, 9% of the premium collected in 2015 relate to policies issued in 2011 through 2013 were used as a prescription drug database.", "We believe the higher than anticipated claims will continue throughout the year and, thus, we are now revising our estimate of policy obligations for the full-year 2015 to a range of 50% to 51% of premiums. At the midpoint of this range, the Direct Response obligations will be approximately $12 million higher than previously estimated. This increase is in the expected policy obligations at Direct Response is the primary driver of the $0.05 reduction in the midpoint of our guidance from $4.28 to $4.23.", "Now regarding our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $86.3 million to buy1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $56.93. So far in July, we have used $15.8 million to purchase 269,000 shares. For the full year through today, we have spent approximately $192 million of parent company cash to acquire 3.5 million shares at an average price of $55.25.", "The parent started the year with liquid assets of $57 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2015. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $57 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $417 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. As previously noted, to-date, we have used $192 million of this cash to buy 3.5 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $225 million of cash and other liquids assets available for the remainder of the year.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of liquid assets as a parent company.", "Regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last two years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but it is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "As of December 31, 2014, our consolidated RBC was 327%. We do not anticipate any significant changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2015. As we have discussed on prior calls, S&P changed their view last year after the treatment of certain intercompany preferred stock and requested additional capital be contributed to our insurance subsidiaries to retain our credit ratings.", "We have reviewed various alternatives available to us and are scheduled to meet with S&P in August or September where we will discuss potential solutions and courses of actions with them. Based on our analysis to-date, should we decide add additional capital, we believe we will be able to address the additional capital needs without significantly impacting our free cash flow available for buyback.", "One option available is for Torchmark to issue additional hybrid securities treated as debt for financial reporting purposes, but equity for S&P capital purposes. If we were to issue such securities in an amount sufficient to meet the entire shortfall we estimate that the overall impact on EPS would be less than $0.01 per share.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2015, we expect our net operating income to be within a range of $4.18 per share to $4.28 per share, a 5% increase over 2014 at the midpoint. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "And we will take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi. First, I just a question on the response claims and you get the amount and the impact on the benefits ratio. Seems like the amount on an annual basis should be about $0.06 a year, so if you could confirm whether that is right. And then, should we expect that will continue into next year and at least for the next few years? And then, secondly, on the agent count at American Income has dropped from beginning to ending obviously on an average basis it was up, maybe you can discuss what drove the decline and what your expectations are for agent count growth at American Income?", "Frank Svoboda", "Jimmy, on the direct response the $0.06 impact for 2015 is right, I mean, until we see as far as the additional impact overall. For 2015 as we had indicated, we see the policy obligations being in that 50% to 51% range and as far as kind of trying to see out -- at our best estimate at this point of time for where that might go in 2016, we see that overall the policy obligation for Direct Response maybe being in that 51% to 52% range and bringing the Direct Response margin maybe down in that 20% to 21%. So, that is really just based on the data that we have available to us today and where we see that going.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And on the agent count American income?", "Operator", "And our moderator's line has disconnected, I'll have to dial back out to them. If you could please standby I'll dial out to our moderator at this time. [Operator Instructions].", "And we still have Mr. Bhullar on from JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And just to be clear on the Direct Response business, it's not that you have seen a sudden spike in claims but it's more you would assume that claims get better and the margins would be better because of the user prescription drug information, and in reality they just have not been, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "Jimmy, that is exactly correct.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And this is -- it is mostly related to the decline this quarter was related to one discreet block as opposed to a spread across the block? Are those policies as opposed to spread across various subsidiaries or other parts of business?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, largely that is correct, I mean there is a little fluctuation, we had some seasonal fluctuation but largely the case.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And those are like the fluctuations are just normal volatility in claims from quarter-to-quarter, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "That is correct.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, thanks. And then lastly just on the agent count drop at American Income it did grew on an average basis but it was down from the end of the previous quarter. So maybe just if you could discuss what drove that and your expectations growth at American Income?", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy, this is Larry. Meeting agent count is less important to the average agent count, there's some fluctuations every quarter just on the last day it depends on the terminations that comes through. If you look at the overall results for the last year we see we have some agent growth. Now we still expect to meet our producing agent count projection of 6,800 to 7,000 agents for 2015.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Erik Bass with Citi.", "Erik Bass", "Hi, thank you. I just had one follow up first on Direct Response. Since you now identified two blocks of issue or the policies from 2000 through 2007 and then the 2011 through 2013, and so I guess was there any difference in kind of your underwriting or pricing assumptions from kind of that 2007 through 2011 period that gives you comfort that you won\u2019t see any higher incidence of claims there? And I guess the same question would be for 2014, 2015. Were there any changes that you made to your unit pricing or to your assumptions for the most recent years?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Erik. With respect to 2011 to 2013 really the change that had taken place again was a lowering of the overall mortality assumptions because we had started using that prescription database. And that assumption did will carry through, through the 2015 issue years, those are not -- 2014 and 2015 are not out of the contestability phase yet. So, we really haven\u2019t seen any claims emerging on those. And of course we are tweaking a little bit over time how we use the Rx but clearly we will be taking a look at how we are using the Rx, why we are not getting any benefits that we had anticipated and be making the appropriate decisions with respect to 2016. So, we do see that being contained within the 2011 through 2015 block. But it really is different than the 2000 through 2007 and some of the higher mortality that we were seeing in the 2000 that earlier block has been built in to -- that portion has been built in the overall assumptions in those later years.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. So there was a change in your assumptions kind of in the 2008 period?", "Frank Svoboda", "Really, yes, overall with regard to some of those earlier years.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. Okay. So you don\u2019t expect kind of the issues you are seeing in the 2007 -- or the 2000 through 2007 block to continue into later a few years?", "Frank Svoboda", "That is correct.", "Erik Bass", "Okay, thank you. And then just one question you gave the target you had for the year-end the agent count for American Income. Would you mind providing any update for Liberty National as well as Family Heritage given the strength that you have seen in recruiting them in past couple of quarters there?", "Larry Hutchison", "Sure. We expect the year-end agent count in Liberty National to be in a range of 1,630 to 1,660 agents. At Family Heritage, we expect the year-end agents count to be in a range of 975 to 1,000 agents.", "Erik Bass", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning. I want to go back to direct response business if I could, and couple of questions there. One is on the previous call I think you talked about the early 2000 vintages being the ones that showed claims activity, now you are talking about 2007. So does that suggest that you have seen elevated claims activity now really moves a little further to the newer vintages as well beyond the 2011 through 2013 issue that we discussed?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. John, on the -- yes, we have talked on the previous calls we did see some of the elevated claim activity in the 2000 and 2007. But as we now have the full claim experience here for the first and second quarters of 2015, we're able to go back. We basically have been able to close out the 2014 calendar year and all the claims associated and paid within that year. We can see the higher claims than what we had anticipated. Again, with -- in that 2011 that third policy year, that first year that comes out of the contestability period, we can now identify that some of the higher claims that we were incurring really related to the 2011, and then now we're seeing some of the same patterns taking place with respect to the 2012 accident year as well. Really at the end of last year, we just didn't have enough claim experience to see and make the jump that it was going to continue for some of the later policy years. Some of the indications that we have now with the new -- with updated client experience we see that trend probably continuing.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. I got -- just to clarify. On the last call you talked about the early 2000 vintages, I think you'd also said that those are vintages they were over a decade old. Now, you're talking about 2000 to 2007. So the 2005, '06, '07 years seem to now quite fall into that category?", "Frank Svoboda", "Now, it's like -- well, when I talked about the 2000 through 2007 issue years still that is the same vintage that we're referring to on the prior calls.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "That part hasn't changed. We really haven't changed our outlook right now with respect to additional claims on that particular block.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And had the 2011 to 2013 vintage data not developed the way it had, will you still have expected the benefits for this year to fall and within the 48.5% to 49% range, which you've previously offered?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, been really close to that 49%.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And maybe one last question on this direct response business. How quickly do you expect the 2000 to 2007 and the 2011 to 2013 vintages to run off? What's the rate of the decay here?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yeah. I'm not sure. I mean, the obviously run off was over really long period of time.", "Yaron Kinar", "Yes.", "Frank Svoboda", "But the -- what we kind of see right now is that probably the peak of the adverse experience of all it expected probably going to -- would be and maybe in like 2017 and that as those years, the 2015 consolidates its contestability period. So we kind of see that has been the low point as far as direct response to margins is concerned and then being able to improve after that.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And I'm sorry. Maybe I sink in one last one. In direct response, we're also seeing a bit of a slowdown in sales. Is that just distributable to repricing of that business now that mortality data has come in a little higher than expected?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think if you recall, the second quarter of 2014 was the largest projection quarter in the history of direct response. So actually, we're pleased with the slight increase this quarter. We still expect an increase in sales in direct response this year in the range of 4% to 6%.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates.", "Steven Schwartz", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning everybody. Just a little bit more on the direct response. First, the -- Frank, the earlier years 2000 to 2007, did that perform in-line with your current expectations for the quarter?", "Frank Svoboda", "For the quarter, we saw just little bit higher seasonal fluctuation that we really do anticipate coming back to the normal trend over the course of the year. Our expectation for the full-year is still in that kind of in that range we talked about last time, probably increasing the overall obligation percentage by 0.4%, 0.5%.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. Great.", "Frank Svoboda", "And so we really haven't changed our overall outlook for that.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. Great. And then on the newer stuff, could you explain the importance of the contestability period ending in this calculation or how you see things? And why is that so important?", "Frank Svoboda", "Sure. Well, for the first two years after issue we have the ability to context any claims that come in during that period of time.", "Steven Schwartz", "All right.", "Frank Svoboda", "But after the end of that two year contestability period the claims are now become non-contestable unless we can prove certain things with respect to that application. But -- so your -- so if you look at the history of this product that third year tends to be the one of the highest claim years and then it tends to trend down after that. So that's when you start seeing those really early claims.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. Well -- okay. Is that just timing of is that -- okay. Anyway -- all right.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, it is just the timing of that.", "Steven Schwartz", "So 2011 through -- pardon me?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, it is just the time of that. It's just that that particular product seems to behave.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. So 2011, you would have seen the losses occur in 2014? Would you have seen losses beginning to occur in 2012 or 2013? I guess I'm a little bit confused about why you're confident that those are going to be bad as well and going forward.", "Frank Svoboda", "Sure. So for the 2011 issue year, we have seen a very little clean activity prior to really at the end of 2013 and then end of 2014. And so 2014 is when you really start seeing the claims activity for that third policy year, not really developing. And then of course you're starting to see some of that claim activity for the fourth policy year as well. For the 2015 -- so during 2014, you see some higher claims, but again you're kind of limited to just very small piece of information on one particular policy year. Late in 2014, now in 2015, you're starting to see some of those claims for that third policy year for the policies that were issued in 2012 and we're starting to see some of those same patterns. And then, of course, 2013, they're just starting to enter that third issue year -- third year after the issue year. And so you're barely starting to see some of those, but it's getting some of that additional data with respect to 2012, some very early returns on 2013 where you're starting to see some consistency that we can rely upon.", "Gary Coleman", "Steven, I would add that Frank has mentioned 2011. We didn\u2019t start to use the Rx information until late in 2011. So really 2012 is the first year we really had enough issues where can start see and experience in late 2014.", "Operator", "We go next to Randy Binner of FBR Capital Markets.", "Randy Binner", "I'm going to stick with that topic, because after Schwartz asked those questions, I guess I'm not clear. This type of direct coverage, would you describe this as final needs-type coverage? And the reason I ask is that it seems like you're having mortality events relatively quickly. Is that the right way to characterize this type of coverage?", "Frank Svoboda", "In general, yes. And those tend to be very quick.", "Randy Binner", "And so when you all said that you were exiting the contestability period, what is it that you have been successful on disputing in that period, and does that have anything to do with the Rx data?", "Frank Svoboda", "I'm sorry, Randy, on that, you kind of cut out on that little bit. I didn't quite catch that whole question.", "Randy Binner", "In the contestability period, what is it that you were contesting, and does that have anything to do with the Rx data or is it more typical contestability type stuff?", "Frank Svoboda", "It's more normal contestability type stuff. So, obviously, you're looking at how the answers and what information they've provided to you, and whether or not there is any misrepresentations with respect to the application. The Rx data, we just simply use to extend that we have authorization from them, we can verify whether or not some of that information on the application is in fact --", "Larry Hutchison", "Some of the blame that Rx is not in the contestability period, but it's a time issue. You have a better underwriting picture and so you either decline some of the business you otherwise would have issued, where some of that is rated as substandard business. So it's not really just a contestability period, it's evaluating the risk if you're underwriting for the life insurance.", "Randy Binner", "Really not --", "Frank Svoboda", "We didn't see that much difference during the contestable periods for these claims. And remember, the issue here is not that the mortality is worse and what we experience in the past, what has happened as we've experienced about the same mortality as we did before we started using the prescription drug as an agent. But the problem was we assumed that we were going to have better mortality in our reserves and that\u2019s why you're seeing the increase in the policy obligations. That\u2019s an overall.", "What we need to look at is the Rx in certain segment that we think probably is benefiting and others is not, and we will have to evaluate what it does and determine how we use that going forward. But I do want to emphasize, we're not seeing worse mortality than we saw before. We're seeing about the same. The problem is, we thought the Rx would lead us to better mortality.", "Randy Binner", "Understood. I just wanted to clarify some of those concepts. And then if I can sneak in another one, just going over to the investment yield. So Gary, I think you said that the midpoint of your EPS guidance assumption is for a new money rate of 500 basis points in the back half. Did I get that number right, the 500 basis points?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes. That\u2019s --", "Larry Hutchison", "That is correct.", "Randy Binner", "And so when we discussed the same topic last quarter, I think that's similar assumption was 475 basis points. So I guess you're 25 basis points higher, and is that because the 10-year, even though it's only up like 15 basis points year-to-date, it's about 25 basis points higher than where we were three months ago? Is that the right way to think of it? And the follow-up there is -- are you actually seeing 500 now, when you're investing today?", "Gary Coleman", "First, to answer your question, it is because of the uptick in Treasury rates. We look at more 30 years instead of 10 year, because of how long we invest. And also to answer your questions, what we've invested so far in this quarter were about 5%.", "Randy Binner", "And is that still A or is that in the BBB area?", "Frank Svoboda", "I believe that\u2019s in the A-, BBB+ area.", "Gary Coleman", "Right. BBB+.", "Randy Binner", "Okay. BBB+. I'm going to ask one more. Then on this notching proposal within NAIC level 1 and 2 securities potentially. Do you have any thoughts for us on that, how that could affect your RBC ratio or how the industry might potentially deal with more categories within NAIC level 1 and 2 from an RBC ratio perspective?", "Frank Svoboda", "The industry as a whole and the industry associations are working pretty closely with the NAIC trying to limit the number of categories from where additional factors might come in play. So that's clearly a work in progress. I think, I said before we kind of see that as a 2017 or '18 event. And that\u2019s the latest information that we have, that's still the best estimates. From an impact our preliminary are using some of the information they have out there, that is of course subject to change, it could mean maybe a 20 basis points to 25 basis points change, reduction in the overall RBC percentage. What we don't know is for sure is then how do the rating agencies and how the users of the RBC data, how do they react to that and so that what we'll have to do from that perspective.", "Randy Binner", "But it is not affecting your thought. I mean you're buying BBB+, because that\u2019s where you see good economic value and also liability matching this change has no impact on that, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "That\u2019s exactly right.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Seen any changes in pricing or your underwriting criteria that are going to impact sales in Direct Response business?", "Larry Hutchison", "Mark, we've done that in past. We always adjust our segmentation, modeling, the nationalized sales and profits, so that\u2019s a constant process as to market for Direct Response.", "Mark Hughes", "Right. Is that to say given what you've seen in terms of the claims activity, that you will be raising prices or tightening up your underwriting?", "Larry Hutchison", "It depends on the segment that you are talking about. We wouldn't necessarily raise all prices, but certain segments as we see differences, not just claims, but response rates, inquires. We adjust our pricing, and we adjust our modeling and our marketing to fit that data that comes back to us.", "Mark Hughes", "Right. And this would normally be circumstances that would lead to adjustments that might constrain sales going forward?", "Larry Hutchison", "It might constrain sales on certain segment, but I don't think it would be fair to say it would constrain sales overall. You just reemphasize your marketing.", "Mark Hughes", "Got you. And then in the third quarter of last year, the med supp sales within Direct Response, you had a very big quarter. Is there any reason to think that might recur again this year? I know you've said you've got tough comparisons or you wouldn't necessarily trend line that, but 3Q was very big last year. Is any of that renewing? How should we think about that?", "Larry Hutchison", "Probably renewing. In terms of new cases we think we will see a decline in new cases since we had an unusual number of new cases last year in the group. In the individual we're predicting 15% to 20% growth for the entire year in our med supp sales.", "Mark Hughes", "Okay. And then a final question. The impact of the Medicare Part D, I think you said it was a $8 million drag, how will that play out in 2016? Will it be an equivalent drag, or will the drag lessen up?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Mark, at this time the best estimates are that we will end up with a receivable as of the end of the 2015 approximately the same as where we were at the end of 2014. So I would think the drag would be somewhere in the same area.", "Mark Hughes", "So as we think about 2016, you think it would be similar?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "Operator", "We go next to Eric Berg of RBC.", "Eric Berg", "Thanks very much. Two questions related to Direct Response. Do I have it right when I say that with respect to the 2000 to 2007 block, that in contrast to the 2011 to 2013 block, in which you are not experiencing higher than expected mortality, you're just not getting the improvement that you had anticipated, in the earlier block you are experiencing higher than expected mortality?", "Frank Svoboda", "That is correct.", "Eric Berg", "Is that right?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's right.", "Eric Berg", "And then what your -- it seems to me, when an insurance company has higher than expected number of death claims or larger claims, it could be for any of a number of reasons. As you have studied these claims from these seven issuance years, what's your initial or best sense of what is at the root of the problem?", "Frank Svoboda", "As we've really taken a look at those claims yes, interestingly enough there really isn't one particular area that seems to be sticking out, if you will, as far as where those additional claims might be coming from. The only thing that that tends to may be a little bit higher than what would be normal average would be some deficit as relating to respiratory illnesses. Other than that that there really is not, when we looked at how we segmented in different areas really it's very little that sticks out.", "Eric Berg", "My second question relates to this pharmacy, the Rx thing. I'm just really scratching my head here on the following sense. I would think that if you took two individuals of identical health, non smokers, same height, same weight, same body mass, let's just assume they have identical health, and you tell me that person A is taking seven different medications for heart and may be cancer and blood pressure and what have you, and the other person is prescription-free, drug-free, that there's no information content in that at all? There's no value in knowing that person A is taking many medications? I just find that -- I'm just scratching my head like you guys are. What do you think is going on here? What's your initial sense of what's going on here?", "Frank Svoboda", "It is a good question, because that is -- when we have and when we've been using the Rx we would exactly why we assume that we would be having the better mortality that is why we're taking a look at that now to really understand why we're not seeing the benefits that we really saw. Is it just in the type of data that we're getting? Is it just simply how we're using that data? Obviously, on some, we do have some more rejects applications that are rejected using the Rx that we would have otherwise. So it's helped in that standpoint. But that's really the question we're trying to get an answer to so we can make the appropriate decisions.", "Eric Berg", "And you don't even have an initial hunch as to what's going on here, why this didn't help you?", "Frank Svoboda", "Not yet at this point in time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Just a quick question on follow-up to Mark Hughes. If the receivable stays constant on the recovery from the government, wouldn't it be a neutral next year on investment income? At some point, this reverses. But if you reverse it, once you got up and put new stuff up, it seems like it would be a neutral to investment income.", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, you're right it would be neutral. It would be about the same drag next years as this year.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. And at some point, it would reverse, right? Do you have a sense on what year that would be?", "Frank Svoboda", "It should reverse by the end of 2016. And then of course depending upon what happens with 2016 claims activity and the receivables and whatever is generating new in 2016.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Right. So if the drag stays the same, but it's not an incremental drag, so investment income should move up with cash flow and yields and not be impacted in 2016, and then it becomes an equivalent positive in 2017 to the negative it's been in this year?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, that's correct. And when I had answered it, I was look at just a drag not an incremental drag, but it's correct, it would be the similar drag in '16 as it is in '15 but then presuming that the receivables actually get to go down or by the end of 2016 you would see the real incremental benefit in '17.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Buyback. Last year's annual report, I think you said you were getting near, but hadn't reached intrinsic value where buyback was the first best use. But you sort of sent a warning that if the stock kept running, last year it was up 4%, it's up, even with the correction today, 10%. Are we anywhere near the point where the warning has to be sent out that dividends might be a use, or is buyback still below intrinsic value?", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, we still believe the buyback is below the intrinsic value and we are trading at the higher even when we wrote the annual report, we are trading at higher multiple, but we still believe it's -- we haven't reached intrinsic value. And so we continue to buy, because still, the return we're getting is in excess of our cost of capital by a good margin and also the return we're getting exceeds return that we're -- we could get on alternative uses. So we will continue on. As we've said before, if we think the price get to at or above the intrinsic value then we'll have to reassess at that point.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Frank's speech was the same as it's been the last 36 quarters, so it seemed like that was the case. But appreciate it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ryan Krueger of KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "I guess, first one, I wanted to follow-up on the prescription drug data. I guess just to be clear, do you only use that when you price Direct Response business, or did you also use that in that some of your other businesses when you were underwriting those?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, it has been used in just very limited situations with respect to some older age issuances in the other agencies. And again I will stress its very limited circumstances and we had not reduced any of our mortality assumptions for the use of Rx in those other agencies. So it's just simply been just an added tool in the underwriting process there.", "Ryan Krueger", "So it's really isolated to Direct Response at this point, for the most part, is that correct?", "Larry Hutchison", "That's correct.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. And then just follow-up to Randy's question on the RBC changes. I know at this -- do you -- I know it's early on still, but it seems like the rating agencies tend to use higher capital charges than the RBC formula already. So I mean is it your best guess that even though RBC ratios will change and go down for the industry, that it won't necessarily change the way that you and others are managing capital?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think that is a very real possibility and you're right S&P has their own capital, factors that they use, and which are higher, and would really be more similar to what the NAIC is looking to move towards, and then Moody's and A.M. Best how they would look at it. But we would anticipate that, or at least, it would be a possibility that no changes at all would be necessary.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Colin Devine of Jefferies.", "Colin Devine", "Thank you. Just to come back, one more thing on this Rx issue. It seems to me, if I'm understanding what you're saying, when you went to that, you assumed mortality would improve. And so I would presume that had some impact on your pricing decisions. Now that it hasn't, it would suggest, I guess, that you're under priced. How much are you thinking right now you may need to raise prices, excuse me, if the Rx data just isn't giving you what you need?", "Gary Coleman", "Well, Colin, it's too early to answer that. Just one thing we will be looking at it. But it's not necessarily we would have to raise prices, it may mean there are certain segments, certain age group, certain --", "Larry Hutchison", "Circulations.", "Gary Coleman", "Circulations that we would have to raise price or we determine that we don't want to sell in those again. So it's more -- we have to a do a little bit more work on that before we can decide whether we raise prices or whether we discontinue in certain segments.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. And then a second question. In looking at the premium growth this quarter, not only was it, I think, the strongest we've seen in over 10 years on the life side, but also on the supplemental side. And has some of your strategy changed there because of growing this up beyond Family Heritage, and really how much longer do you think you can keep this growth rate going? Because I think you've probably got about the strongest organic growth rate in the industry today.", "Gary Coleman", "Well as far as on the life side, we have in places seen the higher premium growth and we think we can continue that and our confidence there is that where American Income where we had the largest amount of business, we\u2019re going pretty in there around at 9% range and we expect to continue growth there. Also, direct response the second largest seller -- premium block that we have but we're going excess of 5% there. So we feel confident that we reached this level and we can at least stay at this 9% level.", "On the health side, we feel the same here because growth prospects I think we want to keep the premium growth on the health side and that's important because you can't needle back just a couple of years ago we had declining health premiums as we had exited some health blocks in the past. So, we feel positive about the future as far as growing the premiums.", "Colin Devine", "What about the general agency this quarter on the supplemental side? It seems to be surprisingly strong.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, as Larry mentioned, we've good growth from our individual mezz up sales and then really we had good growth last year, we're having stronger growth this year. So that\u2019s contributing to the -- that other helpline.", "Colin Devine", "Okay, and then the final one. Again this quarter further improvement in persistency, particularly thinking on the renewal year. How much stronger is that now than what you're pricing for? And what does this say really about your underlying core earnings growth rate since I would that is a significant benefit?", "Gary Coleman", "Colin, I'm not sure I can answer how that's different from what we're repricing. I know we've seen improvements over lot of products. I just quantify here on the call.", "Colin Devine", "Okay. Perhaps we can follow-up afterwards. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We go next to Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.", "Tom Gallagher", "Hi. First question is to do, let's want to make sure I've this right, did you say 9% of total in-force direct response block was the Rx related underwriting was that the right quantification?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's correct.", "Larry Hutchison", "It was the premium received on the '11 to '13 years actually. Just to clarify. ", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. That's premium received on the '11 to '13 years, as a percent of that total of the entire Direct Response in force block, or just of those years?", "Frank Svoboda", "Of the total direct response block.", "Tom Gallagher", "Got you. Okay. So how do we think about, of your new sales this year so far, how much are Rx, using that Rx data? Can you quantify that? Is it 50%? Is it 100% of Direct Response sales that are relying upon this data?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, it's around 50%.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "50% of 2015 sales would be going out using the Rx.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. And at this point -- so it's possible you are going to be repricing 50% of your sales for Direct Response, or is that not the right way to think about it? Is it somehow isolated that the problematic parts are not the entirety of the 50%? How do we think about that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, that's right. It's like what Gary and Larry had mentioned earlier is that we still have to finish the work to determine exactly which segments that we're really not getting the benefit from and where that all kind of lies within that 50%. And there are -- some portion of that may be -- we are getting some at least some incremental benefit from, but that's what -- that's where the work really have to -- so it won't be that big.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. So it's going to be some fraction of that 50% of total sales? And if I --", "Larry Hutchison", "This is Larry. You've to be careful, too, that the Rx in 2011 was less sophisticated than the Rx in later years. As you develop models to get information you have better combinations of drugs you look at as an indicator of health history. So I don't think you're going to assume that 2011 and 2012 be the same experience as '13 and '14. We have to let some of these facts develop. And we're really in the process. And so -- in fact, the '13 and '14 years may be difference experience over the '11 and '12 years were.", "Tom Gallagher", "Understood. And just to put this in context, when you look at the block, if you will, that you have identified thus far that you deem to be under priced, are we talking about a block that's actually losing money? Is it just subpar returns? Can you provide some context around that?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, Tom, we're definitely not losing money. We're pressuring the margins. Overall margins are being pressured. We're -- we've been in the 23%, 25% underwriting margin for Direct Response over the last few years. This year is going to be closer to 21%. And it's early, and our preliminary estimates of how this plays out, we don't see that profit margin going below 18%, 19% at [indiscernible]. So even if that all develops on that basis, we still are going to have 18% to 19% profit margin. We're not in a position of losing money at all. It's just that margin is not as high as it has been in the past.", "Larry Hutchison", "So the lowering of that range it could be higher than the 18% or 19%.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, that's the low ends 18% and 19%. Well, they could be -- that's a worst, so say be somewhere between that and the 21%. And then over time as we price, so we'll get better.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. And then my last question on that is, when you look back to when you began to use the Rx data and pricing on that basis, was it done in response to the market becoming a lot more competitive for you? Had it become more price elastic than it was historically? Like what was the driver of starting to use this, and has that overall part of your business become more price sensitive?", "Larry Hutchison", "If you look at 2011 we saw this as a tool that we could use to better quantify and better look at the risk we're going to underwrite. And the difference is we've assumed that it had a more positive impact than it actually did, so that was a mistake. So it's just the actual experience is not as profitable as we anticipated. That affects your marketing as you go out in those lower performing deciles. So I don't think this is a huge surprise, it's just we -- the business is profitable. We just anticipated a higher profit level for the 2011 year than what's actually developed.", "Gary Coleman", "And Tom we've always looked at the response because we haven't -- in Direct Response, we just can't, from the call standpoint and the time standpoint, do a great deal of underwriting. That's just been the history of Direct Response. What we thought when this came out use of prescription drug, as Larry mentioned, we thought this is a low cost way of getting better information and then to better underwrite, and if we could better underwrite then we could venture into may be segments that we hadn't before.", "So the whole process there was just -- it wasn't from a competitive standpoint to meet competitors. It was more a standpoint to give us a better underwriting that we had before.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Nadel of Piper Jaffrey.", "John Nadel", "Hey, thanks for extending the call for a moment for a quick question or two. Just following up a little bit on Tom's question, if we think about Direct Response overall, maybe it was a low to mid-20s margin, and maybe it's got downside for one or two particular years, down to the very high teens. So if we call it about a five-point swing in that margin, can you translate that to ROE of the business?", "Gary Coleman", "We don't really calculate an ROE on the business. Yes, our return on investment might be lower but we really -- that only really has -- haven't really calculated that, I don't have an answer for that.", "Frank Svoboda", "Now, and John do you mean for that business as a whole or just the overall ROE for the impact that would have on Torchmark's overall ROE.", "John Nadel", "Well, I guess either way, you would be able to -- if you could give us some color on that, whether it's for the Direct Response life business, or whether it's the overall impact to Torchmark. Obviously, for the overall impact to Torchmark, it would be considerably less.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, I mean that's what you probably, looking at a half a percent or something that effect there I would guess. But I agree with Gary as far as looking at the business. We don't really look at it in that in fact or don't have that any way right now.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then if I think -- following up on the question about the percentage of sales that have been prescription-backed, if you will, in the underwriting process, so I think you mentioned about 50% of sales, but maybe it's some smaller portion of that that's actually become a little bit problematic here. If your decision were we just don't want to play -- we don't want to underwrite in this particular segment, looking out to 2016, let's say, in terms of your pricing decisions, you don't feel like you can get enough price or you won't be able to write any business at the price you need anyway, and so you just decide, this particular piece of the business you're just not going to go after any more, how -- if I think about the dollar amount of sales that that's contributed in 2015 or in 2014, how do we think about the headwind that that causes for Direct Response sales?", "Frank Svoboda", "I would say that that's information that we will be able to provide better guidance on in the next call as we kind of really get to get our arms around may be which segments that might have. The total premium using Rx in 2015 probably around $30 million but again as we\u2019ve said, there is not that $30 million is going to go away and you're going to just change your strategy and rethink about how which segments you market into and what your circulations going to be, so it will be a change. But I really couldn\u2019t say that we're expecting that to go away.", "John Nadel", "All right. Understood well we can state here and as you guys sort of hone the data. I guess the last question for you and I realized this is maybe a little nitpicky but turning to health and American income I know it\u2019s mid-teens, maybe mid to upper teens percentage of premium in health segment but or maybe percentage of underwriting income but it looks like the margin there was pressured by a couple of points this quarter. Is it anything more than just maybe some seasonality or normal volatility there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. I think seasonality for because on the year-to-date basis, the margin there is about the same as it was last year, and year think that\u2019s more of just quarterly fluctuations in the claims.", "Larry Hutchison", "In second quarter of 2014 around 30% tax rate we tend to be a little bit low than 32% this year on little bit on the high side just what the quarterly fluctuation, I think we\u2019re estimating around 31% for the year-to-date.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Loss ratio.", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, on the loss.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Seth Weiss of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss", "Yes, hi, good afternoon. Thanks for allowing me to sneak one in. I just want to understand the duration of the business that gone in direct response just get a sense of what the pressure could be in the long-term here and I think it comes back to the contestability period. Is it really the third year that you will or won\u2019t see the spike in claims, so we\u2019re talking about a three year delay in the business that was written. So, if we look out three years from today, 2018 or so or 2019 this will all be corrected or is it a longer duration that direct response business could be pressured in terms of suboptimal returns?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. We really see the higher incidence in claims really third and then little bit less in the fourth and it tends to trail from there. Now ultimately, it will carry on for quite some time. I do think when 2014 and 2015 blocks come in overall that probably gets up to where that is maybe 19% of our total direct response premium and then of course the premium from there will start to go down and as you put new business on the books it will become less and less, have less much of an impact overall. ", "So we really see the impact of this having for the next couple of years and then kind of bubbling if there should bubble in 2017 and then really become less of an issue after that.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. And then also just a level set I think earlier in the call you talked about 51% to 52% benefit ratio in direct response as maybe a run rate for next year, as '14 and '15 business comes in there could be some rest to that number, am I understanding that, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "It could be, you do have the you have a base that is in there already with respect to the higher claims for 2012 and 2013 that we\u2019re anticipating in there. So it does include though an estimate for the impact of 2014 and 2015 is included in that.", "Gary Coleman", "Still do not have that much impact on 2015 because we\u2019re revising our first 2015 issues though we are not reflecting the expected improved mortality from the Rx. So it\u2019s really more of an issue for 2014 but not necessarily 2015 because remember we were this is pass up is the fact that the claims the mortality is higher than what we had anticipated in the reserves. And so\u2026", "Operator", "We will go next to Colin Devine of Jefferies.", "Colin Devine", "Thank you. One quick follow-up. Is it fair to say what direct response that you got the most flexibility compared to your other channels if you just tie into exit the segment because you just can\u2019t get the returns you want or to take more aggressive pricing actions?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. We have much more flexibility there that we would on the agency side. We don\u2019t have infrastructure of our agents that would be shocked about changes in products, premiums, you just don\u2019t have that direct response. That\u2019s maybe one of the things that we\u2019ve benefited over the years the flexibility we have.", "Colin Devine", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Majors, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "Those are our comments and we will talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officer; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2014 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Net operating income for the third quarter was $136 million or $1.08 per share, a per share increase of 9% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $145 million or $1.15 per share, a 15% increase on a per share basis. With fixed maturities that amortized cost, our return on equity as of September 30 was 14.7% and our book value per share was $29.53, a 7% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $34.21, a decline of 1% from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations premium revenue grew 5.5% to $519 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3.5% from year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due to direct response clients which were higher than the prior year but in line with expectations. Net life sales increased 11% to $101 million. On the health side premium revenue grew 9% to $229 million and health underwriting margin grew 2% to $50 million. Health sales decreased 31% to $33 million due to a large direct response group that was added in the third quarter of last year. Individual health sales were $28 million, up 11%.", "Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology costs and pension costs. As a percentage of premium administrative expenses were 5.9% compared to 5.7% a year ago. For the full year we anticipate that administrative expenses will be up around 7% to 8% and around 5.9% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations work", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you Gary. I will now go over the results for each company. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $209 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $66 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 16% due primarily to increased agent counts and productivity. The average agent count for the third quarter was 6,604, up 8% over a year ago but approximately the same as the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 6,658. We expect 14% to 15% life sales growth for the full year 2015 and 6% to 12% for 2016.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $186 million. Life underwriting margin declined 2% to $40 million. Net life sales were up 8% to $38 million. We expect 4% to 5% life sales growth for the full year 2015 and relatively flat sales for 2016.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million and life underwriting margin was $18 million, both approximately the same as the year-ago quarter. Net life sales grew 1% to $9 million and net health sales increased 10% to $5 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,586, up 2% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,602.", "Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 5% to 6% for the full year 2015 and 5% to 10% for 2016. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 4% to 6% for the full year 2015 and 3% to 8% for 2016. At Family Heritage health premiums increased 8% to $56 million, while health underwriting margin increased 1% to $11 million. Health net sales were up 4% to $13 million.", "The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 905, up 19% from a year ago but down 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 854. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 6% to 7% for the full year 2015 and 5% to 10% for 2016. At United American General Agency health premiums increased 19% to $84 million. Net health sales increased from $10 million to $11 million. Individual sales grew 24% to $7 million and group sales increased 6% to $4 million. For the full-year 2015 we expect growth in individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 30% to 35%. As we discussed last quarter, we expect lower group sales in 2015 due to the unusual number of large group cases we acquired in 2014.", "Premium revenue from Medicare Part D declined 14% to $77 million, while the underwriting margin increased from $5 million to $9 million. The increase in underwriting margin was primarily due to an increase in excess rebates from drug manufacturers. We expect Part D premiums of $300 million to $310 million for the full year 2015 and $190 million to $230 million for 2016. We expect margin as a percentage of premium to be approximately 5% to 10% for 2016.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First excess investment income. Excess investment income which we define as net investment income less required interest on policy liabilities and debt, was $54 million compared to $55 million in the third quarter of 2014. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%.", "We have discussed on previous calls the effect of Part D on excess investment income. Excess investment income was negatively impacted by Part D to the extent of $2 million in the third quarter of 2015. For the full year 2015 we expect excess investment income to decline by about 1% to 2%. However, on a per share basis we should see an increase of about 2% to 3%. At the mid-point of our 2015 guidance we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million.", "Now, regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $13.7 billion, including $13.2 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $12.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus and below investment grade bonds are $568 million, similar to the $570 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds in fixed maturities is 4.3% compared to 4.5% a year ago.", "With a portfolio leverage of 3.6 times the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities, is 15%. Overall the total portfolio is rated A-minus, the same as a year ago. In addition, we have not unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $914 million, approximately $81 million less than at the end of the second quarter. To complete the investment portfolio discussion I'd like to address our $1.5 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector.", "We believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. 96% of our energy holdings are investment grade. At the end of the third quarter our energy portfolio had a net unrealized loss of only $23 million. Also, less than 8% of our energy holdings are in the oil field service and drilling sector. And we have reviewed our energy holdings and concluded that, while we expect to see some downgrades, we believe that the companies we've invested in can withstand low oil prices for an extended duration.", "Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $188 million of investment grade fixed maturities primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5.1%, an average rating of BBB-plus and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio the third quarter yield was 5.81%, down 8 basis points from the 5.89% yield in the third quarter of 2014.", "At September 30 the portfolio yield was approximately 5.82%. The midpoint of our current guidance for 2015 assumes a new money yield of 5% for the last quarter of the year. We're encouraged by the potential for higher interest rates. As discussed previously on analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflected on the balance sheet since we would not expect to convert them to realized losses. We have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.", "However, if rates don't rise a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell noninterest protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write off the AC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended lower interest rate environment.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. First I would like to make a few comments regarding our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter we spent $99.3 million to buy 1.7 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $59.40. So far in September we have used $20.6 million to purchase 362,000 shares. For the full year through today we have spent $296 million of Parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $56.52.", "The Parent started the year with liquid assets of $57 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the Parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2015. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the Parent from the subsidiary less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million. Thus, including the $57 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $417 million of cash and liquid assets available to the Parent during the year. As previously noted to date we have used $296 million of this cash to buy 5.2 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $121 million of cash and other liquid assets available for the remainder of the year.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of $60 million of liquid assets at the Parent company. For 2016 we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the Parent will be in the range of $350 million to $360 million.", "Regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries, we plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current rating. For the last two years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but it's sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. As of December 31, 2014 our consolidated RBC was 327%. We do not anticipate any significant changes to our targeted RBC levels in 2015.", "On our last call we discussed the status of Standard & Poor's review of our current ratings, as they had previously placed us on negative watch. Since our last call we met with S&P to review our operations and financial outlook. Earlier this month they formally revised their outlook from negative to stable and confirmed our AA-minus financial strength rating at our insurance subsidiaries and Torchmark Corporation's senior debt A credit rating. In order to maintain adequate capital levels for S&P we will likely issue hybrid securities that are treated as equity for S&P capital purposes but debt for financial reporting purposes to refinance the $250 million of senior debt maturing in June 2016 and possibly to redeem a portion of affiliated investments held at the insurance company. The total financing needed will not impact our share buyback program and is expected to have an immaterial impact on Torchmark's earnings p r-share.", "Now, a few comments to provide an update on our direct response and Medicare Part D operations. As we discussed on our last call, growth in life underwriting income is lagging behind the growth in premium in the quarter primarily due to higher policy obligations in our direct response operations. As previously indicated, the higher policy obligations are largely due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and in 2011 through 2015.", "We also indicated that policy obligations for the full year should be in the range of 50% to 51% of premium, up from around 48% in 2014. We currently anticipate that the direct response policy obligations will be at the high end of that range, resulting in an expected underwriting margin for 2015 of around 21%. Looking forward anticipate that the policy obligations will increase to around 52% in 2016 and that the underwriting margin will be around 20%.", "With respect to our Part D operations, income in the third quarter of 2015 was $9 million or around 12% of premium. And Larry noted in his comments, this increase in the quarter was primarily attributable to an improved outlook regarding rebates from drug manufacturers that are paid to us under our PBM contract with CVS. We've previously estimated that the margin on our Part D operations would be in the range of 6% to 8%. We're increasing that estimate for the full-year 2015 to a range of 8% to 11% based on a higher expected level of rebates relating to the 2015 plan year.", "During the third quarter CMS placed United American and First United American on enrollment sanction. During this time we're not permitted to enroll new individuals or groups into our Part D program. We're permitted to reenroll existing individual members into our 2016 plan, as well as enroll new members of groups that were policyholders at the time the sanction was initiated.", "We have submitted a remediation plan that has been accepted by CMS and we're proceeding with this plan in an effort to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible. The impact of the sanction on our 2015 membership and premium has been immaterial. However, we do anticipate a reduction in our 2016 Part D membership in premium income as a result of not being able to enroll new members. As Larry previously indicated, we anticipate that our total premium income for 2016 will be in the range of $190 million to $230 million and that our underwriting margin will be in the range of 5% to 10% of premium.", "As for guidance, for 2015 we expect our net operating income to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.26 per share, a 5% increase over 2014 at the mid-point. For 2016 we preliminarily estimate that our net operating income per share will be in the range of $4.25 to $4.55 per share, a 4% increase at the mid-point of the guidance. This increase is lower than anticipated due to the headwinds created by our Part D operations and the higher policy obligations in our direct response operations previously discussed. Absent these headwinds our year-over-year growth in 2016 would be between 7% and 8%. The negative impacts of both of these issues are expected to be less after 2016.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will now start with our first question from Randy Binner of FBR & Co. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner", "Just a couple, one is on the recruiting efforts and specifically the overall exclusive agent count, but even looking at it by segment. It's maybe flat to down just a bit on a linked quarter basis, so, looking at it relative to the second quarter 2015. Yet, at the same time I think I would characterize the sales guide for 2016 as good. Just wondering if there was anything lumpy or unusual in the producing agent counts in the quarter and if we should read much into that sequential slowdown in the producing agent count in the third quarter.", "Larry Hutchison", "Our sales guidance incorporates a growth in the agent count in each of the exclusive agencies for 2016. So, I don't see a slowdown in recruiting. What I see is cautionary recruiting. It does change a little bit from quarter to quarter, Randy. As an example, at Family Heritage they had very strong first and second quarter recruiting. It slowed in the third quarter and as a result we had to drop the agent count. But we expect in 2016 to see growth in the agent count at Family Heritage as well as the other agencies.", "Randy Binner", "Is that like a one-for-one relationship percentage-wise, meaning, if you see sales up a certain amount, would we expect roughly a similar growth in producing agent counts?", "Larry Hutchison", "Sales usually lag agent growth because new agents are not as productive as existing agents. But eventually you see a correlation that's fairly close between agent growth and sales growth.", "Randy Binner", "And then just one on the investments, Gary mentioned that you got 510 basis points, roughly, on new money investment grade yields. I think that's like 40 basis points higher than what you quoted for investment grade last quarter on similar duration. So, a little color there. You said you focused on industrials, risk spreads were wider despite the move in the tenure. Is that what you saw? And any color you can provide there would be helpful.", "Gary Coleman", "Randy, we did invest heavily in the industrials but it wasn't so much a focusing on industrials. It's more in relation to the bonds that were available that met our other criteria. So, we were pleased with the yield we got. The 5.1% -- it was really 5.05%. From where we stand today we think fourth quarter will be around 5% from what people are saying about rates, we're looking for a modest increase in 2016. We're expecting to invest about 5% in the fourth quarter, we would expect in 2016 for that to be about 5.25%, slightly higher.", "Randy Binner", "Would that presume a move higher in the tenure or what's underlying that, the 5.25%?", "Gary Coleman", "It's more of a move in the 30-year because, again, as long as we're investing, that's the more appropriate to look at. What we see is, looking at the consensus out there, we're looking at about a 10 basis point increase per quarter in 2016. And that would get us to 5.40% by the end of the year but on average for the year it would be 5.25%.", "Randy Binner", "Okay. So, you're baking in basically the forward curve, if you will, into the guide on that.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Randy Binner", "We'll see what happens because their year's been pretty flat. But that's helpful to understand as part of the guide.", "Gary Coleman", "That's why I mentioned earlier, if we don't have higher interest rates we'll still be able to generate substantial investment income. But, again from what we see and people we've talked to, the consensus is that we will see a slight increase in rates.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Erik Bass", "Just on direct response, can you talk about what's pushing the margin outlook to the lower end of your target? And do you expect 2016 to be the trough margin level?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Erik, I think 2016 will be, as we indicated, lower than overall on a margin than what we anticipate here for 2015, around 20%. We think the trough is probably in 2017 or 2018. I think we indicated on the last call that we thought it should bottom out around somewhere in that 18% to 20% margin range. We still think that's the case and we probably see that maybe in 2018.", "Erik Bass", "And then maybe squaring with your comments around guidance was that you would expect a return to a more normal growth rate in 2017. But we're still going to see some of the headwind on the direct response margins continue post 2016. So, should we think about getting back to an 8% type growth rate or will it take longer to get there if some of these issues continue?", "Frank Svoboda", "We do anticipate just a slight decline in that overall margin on the direct response. We do think it will be slowing down from what we're seeing in 2016 so it will have less of an impact in 2017 and 2018. Very preliminarily we do anticipate that we can get out there to a normal growth range after 2016.", "Erik Bass", "And just final question, I think you're guiding to direct response life sales being flat for next year. I'm just curious as to the drivers there given relatively strong recent sales.", "Larry Hutchison", "The driver there is that the increase in claims is shifting our focus away from those segments in the markets in order to meet our profit objectives. So, our marketing models reside to maximize our production of new business. At the same time we want to meet our profit objectives, that's why we're predicting flat sales for 2016.", "Erik Bass", "So just more targeted sales, restricting the breadth is slowing the growth rate. Is that correct?", "Larry Hutchison", "That's correct.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Seth Weiss of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Seth Weiss", "On 2015 guidance, I'm a little surprised that the mid-point wasn't raised given the better Part D performance this quarter and the raised guidance that's implied for the fourth quarter. Is there any other negative, other than the direct response, coming into the low end of what you described? Is there any other negative to the rest of the business or is this just maybe some conservatism on the lower end of guidance?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Seth, it's largely driven by just a slightly higher outlook as far as the direct response coming at the higher end of that range. And then just a real little bit, the foreign exchange on AILs continuing to be at little bit more of a drag that what we had anticipated earlier on. So, that's impacting it just a little bit. Just a lower outlook on investment income just slightly. Some of the calls that we've had occurred a little earlier in the year than what we had anticipated. So, just a few little things like that on the margins that are just tending to offset the improvement on the Part D.", "Seth Weiss", "And then on Part D just a couple quick ones. The $192 million to $230 million of expected premiums, how much visibility do you have into this? And I assume this assumes no new enrollment given the CMS sanctions.", "Frank Svoboda", "That's correct. It would assume only that we would be exiting sanctions at some point in time during 2016, so then we would pick up some marginal increases there. But it's really, working with our consultants, just a best estimate on looking at the existing members that we would be able to retain and be able to get re-enrolled.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. But there's not tremendous visibility, that could really fluctuate that number. I just want to understand it to now because we have into next year.", "Frank Svoboda", "There is really no real visibility that we have into it at this point in time.", "Seth Weiss", "And if I could just sneak one quick one on excess investment income. Can you give a sense of what your expectations are, what's built into guidance for growth of excess investment income for 2016?", "Gary Coleman", "We're looking for, at the midpoint of our guidance for 2016, we're expecting excess investment income to grow in the 1% to 2% range. On a per share basis it would be more around the 6% range.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Krueger", "I have a couple follow-up questions, first on Part B. I think you mentioned that your remediation was accepted. Would you expect to start growing again in 2017 as you can reenroll?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. I think the expectation would be that going forward we would just have to see what the membership ultimately ends up being in 2016, the outlook that we have It's really difficult to see what would actually happen going forward. However, we really don't see it getting less in 2017.", "Ryan Krueger", "And then just a couple specifics on the 2016 guidance. Can you just talk about what you're expecting for administrative expense growth as well as growth in health underwriting margins?", "Gary Coleman", "As far as the administrative expenses, we're looking at growth there in the 4% to 5% range. As I mentioned earlier, the ratio expenses to premiums for this year for third quarter was 5.9% and for the year it'll probably end up at that 5.9% range. And for next year we're looking at it being in the 5.9% to 6% of premium and that translates into a 4% to 5% increase in premium and then on the health side, at the mid-point of our guidance we're looking for the health underwriting margins to be up around 1%.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John Nadel of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "John Nadel", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just a quick one on Medicare Part D. Should we be thinking about, given the way the rebate has come through here, the nine months of 2015 as the way to annualize the earnings level for 2015 from Medicare Part D? Is that the right way to think about it, that the loss ratio in the third quarter is lower because it's making up for bringing through that rebate from the first two quarters of the year?", "Frank Svoboda", "That is correct. You have a partial inclusion of some of the excess rebate in the third quarter, as well. If the expectations come in, as consistent with what our current thinking is, then you'd see a little bit of a pickup of that in the fourth quarter, as well. Again, overall, we would anticipate our full-year margins to be somewhere in that 8% to 11% range.", "John Nadel", "And then as we look out to 2016 and even a little bit further beyond that, just thinking about the margin pressure until you find that trough a couple years out for direct response, any reason why that downward pressure at direct response should have anything more than a nominal impact on your free cash flow generation?", "Frank Svoboda", "No. I don't think so. You're having just a little bit of a higher claims, of course, that we're having there with the direct response. But as time moves on that will have less and less of an impact overall in the free cash flow. So, I really don't think it will have significant impact going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "I had a few questions, first on the Part D margins, the benefit of rebates. Can you discuss the rebates that you're getting? What period are they related to? Are they on business that you sold earlier this year or is it some of it related to business for 2014? And it seems like you're assuming that the benefit of rebates will continue partially into 2016, as well. And given the opaque nature of the whole process, what gives you confidence that that will be the case? And I have a couple other questions, as well.", "Frank Svoboda", "Jimmy, the rebates do relate to our 2015 plan year, so they really relate to claims that were paid earlier this year. And there's about a nine-month lag that we have in getting the rebates back from our PBM that they're able to pass along to us from the drug manufacturers.", "So, while we had an estimate of what those might be, given our new contract with CVS this year, as we got closer and we're starting to get our cash payments in, it really turned out to be higher than what we had originally anticipated.", "We anticipate those higher rebates to continue on. And the overall estimate, if you will, of those rebates that we expect to receive on the 2015 claims, that will all be built into the 2015. It won't impact 2016 margins, except to the extent that there's any kind of a true up between our estimates and the actual cash payments received.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then on the guidance for 2016, if I think about just the free cash flow and buybacks, buybacks alone should drive about 5% growth in your EPS. It seems like the lower half of the guidance, especially the low end of guidance, even if you build in the headwinds from low interest rates and weaker direct response margin, the low end of guidance seems ultraconservative. But what are some of the assumptions that get you to the $4.25 number in terms of margin, investment income and other things? Because that just seems like too low of a number.", "Frank Svoboda", "At this point in time, given that it's very preliminary and I think we talked about this on this call this time last year -- the way we tend to look at it when we look at that spread is if interest rates work against us and we have high claims again within various of our lines of business in direct response and American Income, you tend to look at if we end up with very low growth on the underwriting side and investment income tends to work against us. And you get all those type of things working altogether and that frames the boundary of that lower end.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then last thing just on your expectations for sales growth in the American income business, I think you mentioned low double digits but is that mostly driven by growth in the agent count or are you assuming productivity improvements there, as well.", "Larry Hutchison", "We're assuming both. We're going to have a lower agent growth in 2016, we believe, at American Income than 2015. We think for 2016 agent count should be between 7200 to 7500 agents. That would be an increase of 8% at the mid-point. We also think we'll see some improvements in productivity with respect to the percentage of agents submitting the average premium. It's awfully early, Jimmy. I think that's our best guidance at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz", "Just a few, as well. Larry, I don't know if this was intentional or maybe I missed it but did you have a UA sales target for 2006?", "Larry Hutchison", "Did not give a target for 2016. For individual Medicare supplement sales for 2016 we do expect 10% to 15% growth. The group sales are very hard to predict because it tends to be so lumpy. So I would take that there would not be an increase in group Medicare supplement sales in 2016.", "Steven Schwartz", "And then am I right, in my notes at least I have that you should be receiving a big cash payment from the federal government for losses incurred I believe it was last year?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's right. Yes, we expect to receive that payment here in November.", "Steven Schwartz", "And, Frank, how big might that be?", "Frank Svoboda", "The total payment will be around $150 million to $200 million, somewhere in that range.", "Steven Schwartz", "$150 million to $200 million. Okay, thank you. And then my last one, again for Frank, on the share repurchase or your guidance for free cash flow, does that incorporate some estimate for downgrades in the energy portfolio, because that will require more capital, I think?", "Frank Svoboda", "In taking a look at that obviously we built in some different scenarios with respect to what we think might happen in our statutory income and statutory capital needs. Whether or not we end up having some downgrade, if we end up having downgrades in 2016 it really won't impact our statutory earnings until 2016 which could impact free cash flow in 2017. But we don't really see that type of activity hitting in 2015 yet that would impact us there.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay, you lost me, because downgrades don't necessarily -- well, I guess they could.", "Frank Svoboda", "They could.", "Steven Schwartz", "If they're bad enough. I'm thinking more along the lines of RBC for each grade. Got you. Does that have an effect?", "Frank Svoboda", "It could potentially. If it's significant enough it's possible that we would have to retain a little bit of additional capital in 2016 that is correct, to cover that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney. Please go ahead.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "I'm going to follow-up on Ryan and Steven's questions. On Ryan's Medicare Part D question, this is a question I've asked several times over the last several years and you've been right to give the answers you've given to date -- which is, why are you staying in that business given the volatility of earnings and the headaches of dealing with Washington administrators, et cetera? Is this an attractive business for you long term? I think you said the premiums won't decline in 2017.", "Larry Hutchison", "This remains a minor part of our business. When we think about Part D, the Part D changes on a yearly basis. So, we monitor that business every year to determine how to best move forward. That will be the case in 2017 and we will see what changes are coming through in Medicare Part D and determine how we move forward with that business. I don't know for certainty if we retain that business it will be a small part of our overall business.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "But the returns are still worth the aggravation?", "Larry Hutchison", "The current returns are but, again, I can't say what the returns are going to be in 2017, 2018. That's too far out to predict what the returns will be on Part D.", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, it's a decision we have to make each year as we go forward. As returns are still favorable lower than what they've been in the past, still favorable, but we will address it each year.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "On the statutory earnings, your 2015 GAAP earnings are flat versus 2014 on an operating basis. The per share grows because of the share count reduction. But your free cash flow looks like it's down about $5 million to $10 million versus last year. Is there anything driving the stat results of this year in your outlook versus last year that swings it to a negative?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, there's a couple of headwinds that you see on statutory and one of them is really primarily the high growth that we have in 2015. Remember, on a statutory basis all the acquisition costs are required to be written off whereas we get to capitalize them for GAAP.", "You do have somewhat of a drain and a challenge, if you will, on your statutory earnings in those year of high growth. I think that's largely driving a little bit of that difference between really seeing flat statutory earnings to maybe even a slight decline. We haven't completed our third quarter statutory financials yet so it's a little bit early to see exactly where that's going to come in.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Makes sense. And credits been a non-event in both years year over year?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes. A non-event.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Berg of RBC. Please go ahead.", "Eric Berg", "At Globe, could you describe what's going on underneath the numbers? And by that I mean can you describe the claims dynamic that will result in a lower margin next year than this year and a lower margin still in 2017? What's happening there in terms of customers for which there was an underwriting issue coming into the mix? I'm trying to understand the dynamic.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Eric, I think what you're really seeing is a continuation of what we experienced here in 2015 where the claims are just higher than expected. We had built in certain mortality assumptions with respect to our overall pricing. And where the mortality and the actual claims aren't necessarily higher than what we have historically experienced, they're just higher than we expected.", "For GAAP reporting purposes, as those claims are actually coming in and they're coming in greater than what we had thought, it hits the bottom line at that point in time. Through the use of the RX and largely it's here on the 2011 through 2015 block, but as the claims start to really materialize on those particular blocks that's where we had thought that we were going to obtain some greater benefits than we really were from using the RX in this underwriting process.", "Eric Berg", "More specifically, is the idea that you saw certain, I'm just trying to understand on the ground, so to speak, what's happening here and by this I mean, is the idea that you saw individuals taking certain prescribed medications, whether it was medications for cholesterol or hypertension or what have you and you thought that these medications would produce a reduced level of mortality and that reduced level of mortality wasn't as great as you had anticipated?", "Gary Coleman", "That's correct.", "Larry Hutchison", "Eric, we started this process in 2011. In 2011 we used outside consultants because it really hadn't been used in our segment of the business. Since 2011 we've attained a lot more data and we're seeing the claims mature from 2011 and we've made adjustments. Since then we will continue to make adjustments on a go forward basis. I think the impact of the RX from 2011 to 2014 will be contained and we won't see that impact going forward in new issue years.", "Eric Berg", "And just one question regarding Medicare Part D, as I understand what you said earlier in the conversation the receipt of cash from the government in particular from rebates on a lag basis nine-month basis was the major factor behind the surprise here, if I understand what you said. If I have that right, if the receipt of cash on a lag basis produces a surprise, then how can you be confident that your rebate estimates for next year will be close to the mark?", "Frank Svoboda", "You mean trying to estimate the overall underwriting margins for 2016?", "Eric Berg", "Yes, precisely. That's my question.", "Frank Svoboda", "Again, the rebates that we're seeing here in 2015, it's the first year that we had our contract with CVS, brand-new PBM contract. The mechanisms that are being used to generate those rebates were new. So, for 2016 we will just have that little bit more of experience. We will have the full year of 2015 as we're putting together those estimates for the amount of rebates in 2016.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes", "You had talked about the choppiness in the large group sales, it's less predictable. Is that market still as attractive as it was? Has that gotten more competitive? Less competitive?", "Larry Hutchison", "It's not more or less competitive. The issue is that you have large groups that you quote on every year and you're just uncertain as to how many of those large groups you're going to be successful in obtaining as new business. So, as we've said, we use the term lumpy, it is lumpy because in some years we have more large groups than others. You can also lose a large group and your premiums would go down for the year.", "Mark Hughes", "But you haven't noticed any change in trend and competition or your yield or your expected margins on that business?", "Larry Hutchison", "No.", "Mark Hughes", "And then the Part D, the remediation effort, does that have any impact on profitability or is there anything that you do that will have a sustained impact on your cost structure or profit expectations?", "Frank Svoboda", "It impacts the enrollment, so obviously you have the impact on the overall profitability there. And other than just having a little higher costs that we're incurring in order to get to work through all the remediation, other than that it doesn't really have an impact on, if you will, the nature of the profitability of the individual enrollees.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Tom Gallagher", "Just a question on Part D. When do you expect to get an answer or have visibility on whether the sanctions are going to be removed?", "Brian Mitchell", "Yes. This is Brian Mitchell. We got our corrective action plan filed and approved almost immediately, in fact, a little bit of head of time. With regard to the time limits that CMS had set for us, we're working through the corrective action plan. And I feel like we're in good stead with where we're in that process currently.", "Based on the complaints that were levied and the basis for the sanctions, I would anticipate and am hopeful that we will be out of sanctions sometime in 2016. Looking at the length of time that most companies who have been under sanction stay, it's been a wide range. It's been as small, I think, as five months and as long as 21 or 22 months. And I think we're on track for 2016.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. So, let's roll forward to 2016 and if the sanction is lifted, when would you be able from a time line standpoint to start again with new enrollees? Would it be end of 2016?", "Brian Mitchell", "The people who are turning age 65 would be able to enroll throughout the year. There is an open enrollment period that is at the end of the year. I think it runs from mid-October to mid to early December. So, that would be the bulk of the enrollees, of course. And we would be able to -- part of the sanctions involved cessation of marketing and we would be able to, I would assume that would be lifted and we would be able to begin marketing again in 2016.", "Tom Gallagher", "And have you looked at others who have been sanctioned and whether or not that would prevent you or limit your revenue growth opportunities? Is there any stigma associated with that when we think about recovering revenue into 2017 and 2018? Or do you believe that you'd be able to significantly grow revenue from, we'll call it, $200 million-ish type level that you're predicting for 2016?", "Frank Svoboda", "Tom, I would say that that would all depend upon the nature of whatever bid that we would put in in June of 2016. So, whether or not revenue would grow or any of that effect would just totally depend upon what type of a strategy we would employ with respect to how we're structuring our overall premium levels and big structure. I think from the word that we've received as far as coming out of sanctions, the fact that you were in sanction and coming out of sanction really would have little or no impact on your ability to market to and attract new enrollees going forward.", "Tom Gallagher", "Okay. And my last question is just on direct response. You had indicated that you're limiting the targeted group of clients but not actually repricing it. Or are you also repricing, whether that's features or the actual premium that's being charged?", "Larry Hutchison", "There is a repricing that takes place in terms of as you model the business. I think the impact we're going to see is in inquiries. There's three segments of our business. We will continue to see growth in our electronic inquiries. And I think we will see inquiries [indiscernible] decline as to continue to eliminate circulation of programs that do not meet our profit objectives. So, it would be in that set of the business I think we will see the biggest impact.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Yaron Kinar", "Just want to follow-up on a few of the questions that were asked. First, the $150 million to $200 million that you expect to receive from the government in 2016 that check comes in November, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "Yaron Kinar", "So, there shouldn't be any real impact on excess investment income from that in 2016. It would be more of a 2017 driver?", "Frank Svoboda", "That would be received here in November of this year. So, that's built into our expectation of excess investment income in 2016.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. I'm a little surprised then to see that, even excluding the direct response and Part D businesses or the headwinds you see there, that earnings would grow only by 8%-ish year over year given that you are getting this nice boost in excess investment income. Are there other headwinds that you're anticipating?", "Frank Svoboda", "Keep in mind and maybe to finish that story on the Part D, there is the payment that we're getting here that relates to the 2014 business. As of the end of the year in 2015 we do anticipate that we will still have about $150 million of receivable from the government. That won't get collected until November of 2016, that's really where your point was.", "So, we're going to be receiving a payment here in this next month. That's why currently we have over $300 million of receivables from the government. We anticipate that by the end of 2015 again that that level be down to around $150 million. And then in 2016 we have attempted to restructure the flow-throughs.", "So we do expect less of a drain on 2016 but there'll still be some negative outflows even occurring throughout 2016. That's why, when you look at some of that growth in 2016 on the excess investment income, there does continue to be a drag from Part D on that, that we really don't see getting lifted in probably 2017.", "Yaron Kinar", "In direct response I think last quarter you'd said that you were still studying the results of the 2011 through 2015 policies that were underwritten using the prescription drug database and at the time you couldn't really point to any distinct pockets or demographics that were driving the higher than expected claims. Have you since learned of any discernible trends or patterns?", "Frank Svoboda", "We have seen some different trends and patterns. It really gets into how we're using our rules engines. It's really at a level of detail that we don't want to discuss on the call. But it is information that we're then taking, looking and using to see how do we modify how we're using that and getting into what Larry's indicated how we think about the marketing and the different segments that we'll continue to market in.", "Yaron Kinar", "But you do have now a game plan set out?", "Frank Svoboda", "A much better idea of how to go about using that.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And final question, on the deficiencies leading to the CMS actions, I think in the prepared comments you said that the CMS accepted the remediation plan and it addresses its concerns. But my understanding is that the CMS sanctions came after several years of deficiencies that they had pointed to. And I was just curious, were there corrective action plans that were submitted over those past three years that were trying to address these weaknesses?", "Brian Mitchell", "Yes. Not in a formal approval stance but we've worked with CMS over the years to address the issues that came up in the 2012 audit. They really related to grievance issues which essentially is customer service and coverage determination which pertains to claims.", "We have made significant improvement over the years in those areas and felt like the audit on itself that happened at the end of the spring was a good quality audit. It was just that, due to the fact that we had some repeat violations from that earlier audit, CMS felt like enrollment sanction which is an intermediate sanction, was appropriate at the time.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. So, you feel like the current plan that's in place will address some of those outstanding issues?", "Brian Mitchell", "I believe it will address all of the outstanding issues that were raised in the sanction letter. Yes. We're required to address each one and then have approval by CMS as to how our plan would progress.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I would like to hand it back over to Mr. Majors for closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2014 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, net operating income from all operations was $131 million or $1.05 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago.", "During the fourth quarter, management determined that the Part D business met the criteria to be held for sale and is classified as discontinued operations.", "Net operating income from continuing operations, which excludes Part D, was $131 million or $1.05 per share up 6% on a per share basis from a year ago.", "Net income for the quarter was $133 million or $1.07 per share, a 5% decline on a per share basis. The decline was due primarily to the fact that we had $11 million of tax driven realized losses in the fourth quarter of this year compared to a gain of $5 million in the year-ago quarter.", "With fixed maturities that amortized cost, our return on equity as of December 31, was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.09, an 8% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $32.71, a decline of 10% from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5.5% to $521 million, while life underwriting margins was $145 million, up 6.3% from a year ago. Net life sales increased 2% to $99 million.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 5% to $225 million and health underwriting margin was up $51 million approximately the same as a year ago. Health sales declined 17% to $16 million due to the decline in group sales. Individual health sales were $38 million, up 20%.", "Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.1% a year ago. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology and pension costs.", "For the full-year, administrative expenses were $186 million or 6.2% of premium. In 2016, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5% and to remain around 6.2% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. I'll now go over the results for each company. At American Income, life premiums were up 8% to $213 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $69 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 9% due primarily to increased agent productivity. The average agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,590, up 4% over a year ago but approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,552. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,600 to 6,800 at the end of 2016.", "Life sales for the full-year 2015 grew 15%. We expect 5% to 7% life sales growth in 2016.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $185 million. Life underwriting margin declined 2% to $37 million. Net life sales were down 3% to $37 million. Life sales for the full-year of 2015 grew 4%. We expect life sales to be flat or down slightly in 2016.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, approximately the same as the year ago quarter. Life underwriting margin was $19 million, up 24%. Net life sales decreased 5% to $9 million.", "Net health sales decreased 4% to $5 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,539, down 2% from a year ago, and down 3% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,478. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,550 to 1,625 at the end of 2016.", "Life net sales for the full-year of 2015 grew 4%. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 4% to 7% for the full-year 2016. Health net sales for the full-year 2015 grew 4%. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 2% to 4% in 2016.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $57 million. Health underwriting margin increased 2% to $11 million. Health net sales were up 2% to $12 million.", "The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 877, up 12% from a year ago but down 3% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 911. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1,000 at the end of 2016.", "Health sales for the full-year 2015 grew 7%. We expect health sales growth to be in a range of 5% to 9% for the full-year 2016.", "At United American General Agency health premiums increased 12% to $90 million. Net health sales declined from $51 million to $38 million. Individual sales grew 49% to $18 million. Our group sales declined 47% to $21 million.", "Individual Medicare supplement sales for the full-year 2015 grew 36%. For the full-year 2016, we expect growth in Individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 8% to 10%.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on policy liabilities and debt was $54 million compared to $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was flat.", "As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has had a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company.", "The impact of the lost investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements in reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinuing operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. In 2015, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $8 million.", "In 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 3%. However on per share basis, we should see the increase of about 6% to 8%.", "At the mid-point of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $13.8 billion including $13.3 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $12.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus, and below investment grade bonds are $640 million compared to $561 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.8% compared to 4.4% a year ago.", "With a portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 17%.", "Overall the total portfolio is rated A-minus, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $506 million, approximately $408 million less than at the end of the third quarter.", "To complete the investment portfolio discussion, I'd like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. As a result of spreads widening in the fourth quarter, the net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio increased by $142 million to a total of $165 million at December 31. However, we believe the risk of realizing any losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. $1.5 billion or 94% of our energy holdings are investment grade. Only a $143 million or 9% of our energy holdings are in the oil field service and drilling sector. Approximately 70% of these bonds are investment grade.", "Also based on the consensus of expert views, our investment department believes that oil is more likely to increase to $45 a barrel or $50 a barrel during the next 12 to 24 months then to remain at current levels.", "We believe the companies in our portfolio can continue to operate for a very long time with oil prices at $45 a barrel to $50 a barrel. Even if oil remains around $30 a barrel for the next 12 to 24 months, we would not expect to have any defaults during that period.", "Finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options that they can utilize to avoid default, including but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credit, and reducing exploration activities.", "Now we do believe that there could be further downgrades which could pressure our RBC ratio. However, that doesn't mean we would have to suspend or materially impact our stock buyback program. Frank, will address this in more detail when he discusses capital.", "Now as to investment yield in the fourth quarter, we invested $341 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5%, an average rating of A minus, and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio the fourth quarter yield was 5.81% down eight basis points from the 5.89% yield in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.83%.", "The mid-point of our current guidance for 2016 assumes increasing money yields throughout the year averaging 5.25% for the full-year.", "We continue to hope for higher interest rates. As discussed on previous analyst calls, rising new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven reflected on the balance sheet since we do not expect to convert them to realized losses.", "We have the intent and more important the ability, to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protected products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.", "While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess divestment income in an extended low interest rate environment.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. First I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $58.68. For the full year, we spent $359 million of parent company cash to acquire 6.3 million shares at an average price of $56.99.", "The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $46 million. In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate additional free cash flow during the remainder of 2016.", "Free cash flow resulted primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders. While our 2015 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2016, to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus including the $46 million available from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have $366 million to $376 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.", "This level of free cash flow in 2016 is lower than recent years due to lower distributable statutory earnings at our subsidiaries in 2015. As we've discussed on prior calls, a key driver of the lower earnings is higher commission and acquisition expenses associated with the higher levels of sales growth we have experienced in 2014 and 2015, coupled with lower growth rates in investment income due to lower new money yields and adverse Part D cash flows.", "Another significant driver of the lower earnings is higher Federal income tax expense in 2015 as compared to 2014. At this time, we anticipate that statutory earnings in 2016 will be approximately the same as 201, as the profits from recent sales starts to emerge, the incremental impact of new sales lessens, and the growth in investment income improves.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last three years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liability, and our ratings.", "Although we had not finalized our 2015 statutory financial statements, we expect that the RBC percentage at December 31, 2015, will be around the 325% consolidated target. We do not anticipate any changes our targeted RBC levels in 2016. Our investment department has reviewed multiple scenarios of downgrades within our fixed maturity holdings including those in the energy sector.", "To put their findings into context, as a rule of thumb, downgrades of around $100 million in statutory book value would reduce our RBC ratio by approximately two percentage points and require around $9 million of additional capital to retain a 325% RBC level. Using this rule of thumb, and to the extent additional downgrades do occur in 2016, we are comfortable that we would be able to fund the additional capital requirements with available assets on hand and other sources of liquidity available to Torchmark without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for buyback.", "Now a few comments to provide an update on our Medicare Part D operations. Management has committed to a plan to sell the Part D business and expect it to be sold before the end of the year. We have met the criteria to account for the business as held for sale and the results of the Part D operations will be reflected within discontinued operations in our financial statements.", "As we have previously said, we originally decided to participate in the Medicare Part D program back in 2006 because most of the underwriting risk was covered by the government and we believe that would complement our Medicare supplement business. Over the years, the Part D business has been good for Torchmark as it is provided over $259 million of underwriting margin since 2006. However, this business has been changing rapidly over the past few years and the earnings had become much more volatile. Increased competition, industry consolidation, and preferred networks have reduced overall margins and made it more difficult for smaller players to compete in this market.", "While we are still generating profits from the Part D operations, those profits have been shrinking in recent years due to higher drug cost and increased administrative and compliance cost. We believe this trend will likely continue and perhaps could even turn into significant losses in the future as drug costs, especially those on specialty drugs continue to escalate.", "In addition, we have already seen regulatory changes that have shifted costs from the government to carriers and it appears likely that more cost shifting is to come. Overall, the risks and the administrative and compliance costs associated with the business are much greater than they once were and the business now demands an increasingly disproportionate amount of time and focus given its level of earnings.", "Looking forward, we prefer to focus our attention on our core life insurance businesses and our other lines of health business that produce more predictable stable margins. We previously indicated that we view this business opportunistically and then we would review it on a yearly basis. While the Part D business has been a good opportunity to this point, we no longer believe it is a business that makes sense for Torchmark going forward and therefore it is the right time to exit the business.", "We have included on our website a final operating summary for the discontinued operations. For the year we earn $10.8 million or $0.09 per share after tax. This amount was lower than we had anticipated on the last call due to higher than expected claims in the fourth quarter as a result of higher drug cost.", "To the extent, we were to hold the business for the full-year 2016; we estimate that our after-tax earnings would be in the range of $5 million to $9 million. As noted on our previous calls, the profits from the Part D business are further reduced by lost investment income that results from having to finance substantial cash outflows during the year including amounts paid upfront on behalf of the government that won't get repaid to us until the following year. These outflows are generally represented by the significant receivable balances that are included in the assets held for sale line of our consolidated balance sheet.", "The opportunity cost of not being able to timely invest the receivable balances is included in our continuing operations as required by the applicable accounting rules. However, to reflect what management considers to be a better reflection of earnings from the Part D operations, we have included on our website a schedule showing the pro forma income from discontinued operation, and includes an estimate of the after-tax cost of the foregone investment income.", "As we're in the midst of discussions with multiple parties regarding a purchase, we're unable to discuss the timing, potential value, or other details of the sale. However we do anticipate that the assets held for sale on our balance sheet will be fully recovered and do not believe the consummation of the sale will have a material impact on our income from continuing operations. Any such impact on earnings is included in the range of earnings guidance provided.", "Now with respect to our guidance for 2016, on our last call, we indicated a preliminary range of $4.25 to $4.55 for our 2016 net operating earnings per share with a mid-point of $4.40. Excluding the effect of the discontinued Part D operations, the mid-point would have been $4.35. We now estimate that our earnings from continued operations will be in the range of $4.28 to $4.48, a 6.1% growth at the mid-point over our 2015 earnings from continued operations. A schedule providing prior year earnings per share for continued operations only and our revised 2016 earnings per share guidance has been placed on our website. Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. Those are our comments; we will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "And we'll take our first question today from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to start with the last point on the revised guidance, the $0.03 increase in the midpoint. Looking at the different parts of the guidance that the granularity that you offer seems like you're expecting sales to actually come down a bit from your prior guidance, expenses may be going up a little bit, headcounts may be a little weaker. So where is the positive offset coming from? Where are you expecting to out-earn your previous guidance?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, I think in looking at the increase at the mid-point, we really have an improved outlook on life and underwriting margins, underwriting income overall and there is a slight margin improvement at Liberty National given the favorable claims experience that we had in Q4. And then really the high -- really favorable sales that we had at American Income is well just a better expectation with respect to some of our premium at direct response really impact the 2016 guidance. You need to remember that the some of the reduced sales guidance with respect to 2016 really don't impact the 2016 premiums as much as they will premiums looking out past that.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay, that's helpful. And then you had talked about expecting new money yields going up a bit over the course of 2016, or at least that being one of your underlying assumptions. What's that based on there? Is it spread widening? Is it opportunities you see in the market?", "Gary Coleman", "It's a little bit of both it's we are expecting and this is from our investment department gave us all reports coming in with a consensus. We expect the treasury rate to, although it's declined so far in January, we expect it to gradually increase during the year. Spreads we're pretty much expecting to stay where they were towards the end of 2015.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And then one quick final question. Is there any capital impact from the sale of the Part D business?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, there will be eventually some of the capital freed up. We do have to carry some RBC on that business. We would estimate, we would probably carry, we don't have the final RBC for 2015 done yet, but with respect to that business that we would expect it to be somewhere may be in that $60 million to $70 million of capital ultimately we hold on that business. We would see that capital being freed up over the course of 2016 and then partially and then more fully over the course of 2017.", "Yaron Kinar", "So the expectation would be then that it would be deployed like in 2017/2018?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, and though it's a possibility that we would be able to deploy that capital or would be able to distribute some of that excess capital, but we would really have to be able to see what's the capital situation looks like at that point in time, but probably it really wouldn't be fully available if you roll into that 2017/2018 timeframe.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "So first question just on available resources for buybacks in 2016. I think Frank; you mentioned the cash available with the liquidity on hand will be $366 million to $376 million. And if I assume like roughly $70 million for dividends and also put in the cushion that you're going to hold a $50 million to $60 million, it implies buybacks of about $250 million in 2016. Is that a fair assumption?", "Frank Svoboda", "No, I think our, as I indicated I think the free cash flow that was available for buyback that we see for 2016 should be in that range of $320 million to $330 million.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, got it. Because I was taking out the dividend and the numbers you gave were post dividend?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, that's correct.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then as we think about from 2016 to 2017, given I think you mentioned in your remarks that sub-dividends will be somewhat stable or flat, that number shouldn't change that much in 2017, right?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's correct.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And the proceeds from the sale whenever that happens are those going into the sub, or would those come directly to the whole? I realize the capital freed is going to be sitting in the sub and might not be dividend deductible, but what about the proceeds, where would those go?", "Frank Svoboda", "Those go into the subsidiary.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And when you talked about freed capital that did not obviously include any impact from proceeds, right? From the sales proceeds?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's correct.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just on the business, your direct response sales were weak, and I think you're expecting a flat or sort of flattish sales in 2016 off of just 4% growth in 2015. So may be talk about what's going on there, whether it's because of the market environment or is it more some of the changes that you're making, given what's happened with your margins in that business?", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy, as we have discussed previously, we've experienced lower than expected profit margins associated with prescription drug underwriting changes. So sales will be lower since we've now adjusted our marketing activities to eliminate the segments of profitable sales.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citi.", "Erik Bass", "Hi, thank you. First Frank, could you just elaborate a little bit on your comment about if you do see ratings downgrades you think that you could use some assets on hand or other measures to kind of plug the RBC impact? Can you just expand on that a little bit?", "Frank Svoboda", "Sure. As indicated in the -- in my comments that we kind of looked and have that rule of thumb that roughly $100 million of downgrades would extrapolate into probably needing about an additional $9 million of additional capital retained at current RBC levels. And so whether it be the cash that's available at the holding company or as we said from being able to access the capital markets that we would have sources available to make for additional capital contribution to the company if we needed to. Because just even using that rule of thumb if we were to have around $500 million of downgrades which is about half of the BBB energy bonds that we have out there that would really indicate that we would only need around $50 million of additional capital to retain our existing RBC levels.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. And obviously one option would be to just not dividend that out as well. So I think were you implying that you don't expect any change to the free cash flow guidance or could the free cash flow be lower in that scenario?", "Frank Svoboda", "Always a possibility, but we would always be looking at the opportunities and looking for the cheapest or most inexpensive way for our shareholders to fund that additional capital.", "Erik Bass", "Got it, thank you.", "Gary Coleman", "Erik, I was just going to say, Frank is right. We probably use the lower cost approach. And if you're talking about $50 million we could use the cash on hand or we could borrow short-term at a very low cost. To us, that's a much lower cost and reducing the dividend, the amount we're dividending to the parent company.", "Erik Bass", "Got it, that's helpful. And then just one question on direct response policy obligations. As a percentage of premiums they were slightly above the 52% range that you're targeting for next year. Any comments there and what gives you confidence that that ratio will come down over the next year?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes that's right, and that 52% was what we had there in Q4. And for the year as a whole we had the obligation percentage of around 51% which was right at the top edge of what we had estimated for 2015. I think for 2016 we had previously indicated we thought the policy obligations would be around that 52%. If I move that up just slightly to somewhere in the 52.5% range is kind of what we would anticipate for the policy obligations and we're still really seeing our -- the overall margin percentage on the direct response in '16 being somewhere in that 19.5% to 20% range pretty much related I previously indicated, we haven't really seen a lot of change in that at this point.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.", "Steven Schwartz", "Hi, good morning, everybody. First just a couple I guess on Part D. It sounds maybe it's the nature of the Part D business, but it sounds to me from the conversation that just occurred with regards to when capital will be released, that you kind of will remain on the books, on the hook until current liabilities runoff. And then, so in a sense you're selling really the renewal rights. Is that an accurate way to think about it?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well we really would be, have responsibilities for the business up until the time of sales unless there's some other arrangement with a buyer from that perspective. Of course really can't get into any details of how that might work. But I think the point was that from an RBC perspective, the way that the RBC rules work is if we sold it now or part way through the year, you don\u2019t get 100% reduction of that at the end of 2016. Some of that bleeds over into 2017. And then of course we are settling up even in '17 just with respect to -- or potentially we could be settling up in '17 on just receiving payments and again just depending on how the sales process and what arrangements or work that would require.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. And then, Frank, I think you said that you thought the drag in 2016 from reimbursement patterns on Part D would hurt by about $8 million, your excess investment income. Does that mean looking at a 2017, model just add that back?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "I mean in '17 let me modify that. In 2017 there is still going to be a little -- here again all that's kind of assuming that we have a business for the better part of 2016 and then there are you have a little bit of drag in 2017 just pending the receipt, if you will, of the various receivables that we would anticipate as of the end of '16.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. And then Larry, I apologize; I came a little bit late. Did you run through kind of the sales expectations for the individual agencies already? If you did, I'll just check the transcript.", "Larry Hutchison", "I did, but I'll be glad to go through it again. For 2000 --", "Steven Schwartz", "That's okay. I'll check the transcript. Let somebody else ask a question. Thank you, Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner", "Yes, thanks. I guess Steven Schwartz kind of asked my question, but I'm just trying to understand what it is exactly you're selling? And I guess is the right way to think of it as mostly a renewal rights deal? I mean there is -- are there really standalone systems or other kind of distribution assets that would transfer with the business like this Part D business?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, it really is a sale of contracts to be able to offer the Part D prescription drug coverage. So to a certain degree it is the renewal rights. We want to think about in that way, there aren\u2019t any hard assets; we don\u2019t have any systems, those types of things that are infrastructure, if you will, that's being sold.", "Randy Binner", "All right. And then just to follow-up on an earlier question too. I guess the lack of earnings impact has to do with the fact that this is just a short tail business, so it resolves -- it kind of resolves itself over the next 12 months, and then someone would have the right to kind of take the book from there if they wanted to?", "Frank Svoboda", "That\u2019s correct.", "Randy Binner", "And then just touching on, and I apologize if I missed this. But did you all go through kind of where you're getting new money yields right now on investment grade and below investment grade? And I'd also be interested if you're seeing kind of stress or need for derisking in any part of your investment portfolio outside of energy?", "Gary Coleman", "Well Randy, as far as where we're placing our money. I mentioned that it's primarily the industrial sector and that's where it's been as what we mentioned in the last two or three quarters. Within that it's mostly been in the consumer sector, we the transportation some of the other industrial sectors, we haven't really added to our energy exposure.", "As far as derisking, we don't see at this point a need to sell any of our bonds. And again let's talk about energy because that's what most people concern is. We feel confident in the bonds that we have and we expect them to be money good. So we don't expect to sell any of those. In the last few years we have, I think done a good job of spreading the risk of we were a little overweight on financials a few years ago with. I think it's -- I think we're pleased with where we are with our distribution by sector.", "Randy Binner", "And then just on yields, did you touch on where you're getting new money yields in investment grade? And is it investment grade kind of A minus; is that the center point of the portfolio right now?", "Gary Coleman", "It's A minus BBB plus.", "Randy Binner", "And what yield did you get in the fourth quarter there?", "Gary Coleman", "On fourth quarter we were just a little under 5%. And I mentioned earlier that we've had some tax driven sales at the end of the year that actually pushes a little bit under 5%. Had we not done that but I can't remember but it seemed like we would have been 5%, 10% or in that range. So far this quarter we've invested a little over $100 million as 5.25%. But the rates have just the last few weeks have gone down, and so, if we were investing money today it would probably around 5%.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.", "John Nadel", "Hi, good morning. I have a couple of questions. One on the American Income agent count, if I look 3Q to 4Q kind of surprised by the decline, maybe it's nothing more than some culling of underperformers at year end. I suspect that's really the answer for Liberty, but can you give us some color on that?", "Larry Hutchison", "I think your question was American Income or was it Liberty?", "John Nadel", "Well, the question about American Income. I'm -- I just -- I suspect because we typically see that kind of culling at Liberty in the fourth quarter. It doesn't -- I don't think we tend to see as much in American Income, but maybe I'm wrong.", "Larry Hutchison", "Okay, thank you. There is two reasons for lower guidance. It's based in part on the lower recruiting numbers I've seen during the fourth quarter of 2015 in January this year plus remember 2016 calls two strong years of agency and sales growth at American Income. Over the two-year period our industry grew by 23%. So based on our historical data I just sort of expect solid growth here in 2016. I'll be in a better position to give that guidance into the second certainly by the third quarter call probably better feel for the agent growth for 2016.", "John Nadel", "Okay. But the dip from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in the actual agent count not producing but I'm sorry, not the average producing agent count but the actual quarter-end agent count? What was the driver of that?", "Larry Hutchison", "And if you look back at that, that's seasonal with the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. Within American Income there is always a seasonal drop from third to fourth quarter.", "John Nadel", "Okay. Then the second question is that sensitivity that you provided on the $100 million roughly of downgrades is equating to roughly two points on risk based capital. Is that a -- and what is the downgrade is that a one notch downgrade or is it a entire letter downgrade? Meaning if that -- if we thought about $100 million of your BBB is going to BBs?", "Frank Svoboda", "Generally I mean that's again kind of rule of thumb and looking at different multiple scenarios and kind of looking at just kind of what -- I hate to use the word averages, but just what can you glean from taking a look at all the multiple scenarios, including taking a look at just some of the part at just some of the -- we did look at just the BBBs and may be really more NAIC class 2s and moving them down into class 3 and what if everybody wants to go down a notch and I mean those are included in those various scenarios we took a look at.", "John Nadel", "In that case it would still stay within the NAIC 2 category, correct?", "Frank Svoboda", "It would stay within the NAIC -- well there would be some that would go from NAIC to NAIC --", "John Nadel", "2 to 3, yes.", "Frank Svoboda", "It definitely did include the drops from 2 to 3.", "John Nadel", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the -- what was my last question? I'm sorry to do this to you. Oh, I guess my question is this: so as you think about the level of buybacks here for 2016, and it seems for 2017 a similar level, so in that $320 million to $330 million range is there some different approach to timing then that we should consider? I mean there's been obviously moves in the market and moves in stock valuations. I'm curious; you kept the pace pretty consistent during 2015. And I don't like to tend to ask about these kinds of questions about pace, but I'm sure you are just as aware as most market participants are aware that there's a lot of speculation about Torchmark amongst may be a few other companies as an interesting potential takeout candidate following some of the transactions that took place over the last year or two with Protective and Symetra and StanCorp. And I'm curious how you think about the impact of that on your stock price and on your pace of buybacks.", "Frank Svoboda", "I would say generally with respect to the pace of the buyback is that we would continue for the most parts to have those buybacks radically throughout the course of the year. So we would still think about having 80 some million dollars some per quarter. And then where you do think that maybe there is some market opportunities, may be that stepped up just a little bit in kind of a near-term. Obviously, we have had that from time-to-time, where one quarter was a little bit more or less than the average, if you will. But I don't see us wearing for all strategy at any significant degree.", "John Nadel", "Okay. And then is there any change as a result of Part D moving now into discontinued operations and essentially lack of sales at this point? Is there any change in the amount of new cash that you expect to be investing, the pattern that that looks like 1Q to 2Q to 3Q and obviously 4Q is a pretty high level of cash invested and I assume that was in part driven by the receipts of cash from CMS?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, that's correct. Looking forward to -- within 2016, it doesn't have a -- it will continue to have a drag throughout 2016, tends to build a more of a drag in the first three quarters of the year, but then a little bit more of that pop in the fourth quarter again.", "John Nadel", "And your expectations for what that receivable will look like? Were the cash received in the fourth quarter of '15, how much is that?", "Frank Svoboda", "We have around, yes, around $75 million what we would anticipate -- excuse me, that's as of the end of 2015 that we would -- no, that's right. In the fourth quarter of 2016 somewhere in that $75 million range is what we anticipate being a receivable from CMS.", "John Nadel", "Okay. So not nearly as big as the one from '14 received, just a quarter early?", "Frank Svoboda", "That's correct. We have -- we do anticipate it going down.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the I guess decline in cash flow for 2016 relative to really the last three years. Can you help just walkthrough the drivers of that? I know a lot of it is sales driven, but if you could give us little bit more granularity? I was little surprised at the step down in cash flow.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. I mean -- again as indicated -- I think there is couple of key drivers that all kind of work together to push that down. But you do have the higher sales. Since we talked about you have higher sales and in the first year of those sales, acquisition expenses exceed the amount of premiums coming in, so there is a drag on your statutory earnings from those.", "And then in your -- you start having positive statutory incomes in that second year of this after the sale. But as you continue to -- as we have the last couple years, well we've had two really good years of continued sales and sales growth that's just pulling down on the amount of statutory income. And now we anticipate those future profits from the sales to start really emerging coming in the future here.", "But that's probably generating somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million of statutory drag in 2015 just by itself. And then in a lot of normal years you'd have good increase in investment income that would help to offset that. But unfortunately, the last couple of years with the continuing drag that we have had largely from the Part D, and then of course lower interest rates, and to some degree the higher direct response claims, we have been having growth in that investment income of only around at 2% or slightly above 2% level and rather than at that 4% or so percent where our invested assets are growing at. So that's winging on it.", "We have talked a little bit about we had some higher acquisition or administrative cost in this, just in growth in 2015 from some of our IT and pension cost and that type of thing. And then, the way that the accounting rules work for Federal income taxes, we just -- basically are -- you don't get quite the smoothing effect you have on for GAAP purposes. And we just end up having some higher taxes in 2015 here than we did on a comparable basis for 2014.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. So there is I mean obviously a lot of factors there. If we look back over the last three years, was there anything unusual and perhaps unsustainable that was contributing to cash flow or would you think of the next two years as may be that the drag from higher sales in some of these other items that you've outlined as may be keeping it unusually low for a couple of years?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. I think your later comment. I think it's -- I don't see anything that was terribly unusual other than may be the drags of some of the higher direct response cost and then the drag from Part D.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ryan Krueger with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Couple other follow-ups. In terms of the $60 million to $70 million of capital back in Part D to the extent that runs off, I can say wouldn't come through, I don't think as earnings that would. But would you still -- would you view that given that it would cause an increase in the RBC ratio as being able to be divided and up to the parent company in the following year?", "Frank Svoboda", "Right. It does not come through as earnings as you said. So that well it may be available as extraordinary dividend to the extent that our capital levels would permit it. But it truly would have to be something that would have to be approved by the regulators.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. Got it. And what entities are -- is this business in legally?", "Frank Svoboda", "United American predominantly.", "Ryan Krueger", "Got it. Okay. And then on the downgrade scenario. Some of the other companies that the scenario that they provided have been lower than the impact would like it would be if you simply apply the RBC and factors for C1 risk? And they've mentioned co-variants and diversification offset to that. It didn't seem like you -- I guess in your impact it didn't seem like there was any sort of co-variant offset, so how should we think about that?", "Frank Svoboda", "I think you should -- the impacts of the co-variant from the other offsets were taken into account, estimated to some degree within that overall rule of thumb that I provided.", "Ryan Krueger", "All right. And then last one. Can you just discuss the -- how the impairment policy work so from a pricing standpoint. So if you fully intent to hold a security to maturity, but the bond let's say is trading at $0.50 on the $1 for an extended period of time. Is there any -- anything that requires you to potentially impair that security if you still think it will pay off at par?", "Frank Svoboda", "No. And the answer to your question, the fact that it's just trading below book value in and of itself even for an extend period of time wouldn't require us to impair that security. We would have to take a look and evaluate that particular bond offering and determine do we think its money good. And as long as we believe that we're going to collect that, the principal amount from that. And in our particular case, we have the ability and the intent to hold those two maturities. So as long as we believe and can demonstrate that we will be able to collect that at maturity, then we do not have to have an impairment on the accounting rule.", "Ryan Krueger", "That includes both GAAP and statutory?", "Frank Svoboda", "Correct.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good morning. What's behind the margin improvement in Liberty National in Q4? And I think you said it was a factor behind your revised guidance for 2016?", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, it really is more of a timing issue there, because the -- if you compare the two quarters the reason for the higher margin is that we had lower policy obligations in fourth quarter '15. As it turns out, fourth quarter '14 was our highest policy obligation quarter and fourth quarter '15 was the lowest for the year 2015. If you look at on a year-to-date basis 2015 was 38% of premium versus 39% of premium the year before, so it's yes pretty much same.", "Our outlook for the coming year is that we'll policy obligations will be at around 38% level. And our margins would be somewhere I think at the midpoint about 26.5% and that's a little bit lower than 2015, but little bit higher than 2014.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "So you didn't say that the preset increase was partially due to Liberty National margin assumptions for '16 change?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. What I had just indicated was that we just had little bit of an improved outlook internally with respect to where that margin was with the -- from what we had back in the third quarter. So I think we're anticipating our overall margin to be somewhere in that 25% to 27% range for the entire year of 2016 and just a slight improvement over where we just kind of thought it would have been back in October.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "But nothing has changed at Liberty National Q3 to Q4; I misheard that for your outlook?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay.", "Frank Svoboda", "We had a -- we -- between Q3 and Q4 guidance we just had a slight increase in our expectation of the margin for 2016.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "I thought you motioned Liberty National in that, but you didn't. You didn't mean too.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. On the price it was Liberty National.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Now, I'm confused. Let me step back. So has Liberty National changed at all from Q3 to Q4?", "Frank Svoboda", "For Liberty National, our outlook on the overall margin for 2016 increased slightly, partially.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. What's behind that?", "Frank Svoboda", "Just a slightly better outlook as far as our net policy obligations.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. And what's the timing of the sale? How far alone are you? Are there RFPs out?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes. We can't -- we really can't talk about it.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Whether there are RFPs out, you can't say?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, I think in my comments indicated that we're in the midst of discussions with multiple parties.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.", "Eric Berg", "Thanks. Frank, I was hoping we could return to the question about the reduction in ratings in the energy portfolio. Is the $100 million a principal amount on the $9 million of incremental capital that would be required? Is that the result of -- again in response to John Nadel's question, is that an analysis that looks at the impact of an -- of multiple rating, multiple scenarios for notching changes or just one notch? I was not clear in the response.", "Frank Svoboda", "It's kind of amalgamation of looking at multiple scenarios our investment department took a look at. Some of those scenarios would have taken -- would have looked at one notch downgrade for the entire portfolio.", "Eric Berg", "Right.", "Frank Svoboda", "We would have also looked within that those range of scenarios just dropped from NAIC from 2 to 3 for a certain amount of our portfolio. And obviously, it is different if you -- if all of the downgrades go from one notch down to another notch. If it's all 2 to 3 we'll have some impact. But as a general rule, we believe that this rule of thumb will hold or be fairly close.", "Eric Berg", "Okay. Why don't I leave it there for now? Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, at this time I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "All right. Thanks for being with us. Those are our comments and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2015 10-K.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, net operating income from continuing operations was $133 million, or $1.08 per share, a per share increase of 6% from a year ago.", "Net income for the quarter was $124 million or $1.01 per share, also a 6% increase on a per share basis. With fixed maturities that amortized cost, our return on equity as of March 31, was 14.5% and our book value per share was $30.65, an 8% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities at market value, book value per share was $35.72, a decline of 6% from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $544 million, while life underwriting margins was $144 million, up 2% from a year ago. Growth and underwriting margin lagged premium growth, due to higher claims, primarily in direct response. For the full-year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 2% to 4% over 2015. Net life sales were $104 million flat compared to the year-ago quarter.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $236 million and health underwriting margin was $52 million approximately the same as a year ago. For the full-year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. Health sales declined 1% to $32 million due to the decline in group sales. Individual health sales were up 1% to $28 million.", "Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. The primary reasons for the increase in administrative expenses are higher information technology costs. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.2% same as a year ago. For the full-year, we anticipate administrative expenses will also be around 6.2% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. I'll now go over the results for each company. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $213 million and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $69 million. Net life sales were $50 million, up 7% due primarily to increased agent productivity. The average agent count for the first quarter was 6,206, down 2% over a year-ago and down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 6,225. We expect 5% to 7% life sales growth for the full-year 2016.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 7% to $200 million. Life underwriting margin declined 13% to $37 million. Net life sales were down 8% to $41 million due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be flat to down 3% for the full-year 2016.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million, approximately the same as the year ago quarter. On life underwriting margin was $18 million, up 6%. Net life sales increased 11% to $9 million.", "On net health sales increased 19% to $5 million. The sales increases were driven primarily by improvements in agent productivity, recruiting and retention. The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1,542, up 5% from a year ago and flat compared to the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,711.", "Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full-year 2016. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 5% to 7% for the full-year 2016.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $57 million. Our health underwriting margin increased 8% to $12 million. Health net sales were down 9% to $11 million due primarily to reduced agent productivity.", "The average producing agent count for the first quarter was 827, up 5% from a year ago but down 6% from the fourth quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 881. We expect health sales growth to be in a range from 2% to 6% for the full-year 2016.", "At United American General Agency health premiums increased 6% to $88 million. Net health sales were $12 million, down 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual sales grew 2% to $9 million. Our group sales declined 10% to $3 million. For the full-year 2016, we expect growth in Individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 9% to 11%.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, regarding excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less acquired interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $55 million flat compared to the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income increased 2%.", "As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to the negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company.", "The impact of the lost investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. In the first quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.8 million compared to negative impact $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter.", "For the full-year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow about 1% to 2%. However on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%. At the mid-point of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $8 million to $9 million compared to the drag of $8 million in 2015.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $14.2 billion including $13.5 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $12.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-minus, and below investment grades are $771 million compared to $604 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 5.7% compared to 4.8% at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase and below investment grade bonds is due primarily to first quarter downgrades of securities in the energy and minerals and mining sector.", "However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, subsequent to these downgrades, the current market values of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 20%.", "An overall the total portfolio is rated A-minus, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $970 million, approximately $464 million higher than at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Now, to complete the discussion of the investment portfolio, I would like to address our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. The net unrealized loss of our energy portfolio decline from $165 million at the end of 2015, $128 million at the end of the first quarter and improvement of $27 million. We believe the risk of realizing losses in the foreseeable future is minimal for the following reasons. First, even with the significant rating agency downgrades in the first quarter 89% of our energy holdings remain investment grade.", "Next only $143 million, or 9% of our energy holdings, are in the oil field service and drilling sector. While we had significant downgrades are in the first quarter energy sectors, we have seen improvement in market values recently. We believe the companies we owned have sufficient liquidity to endure the cycle.", "Third, based on the consensus of expert views, our investment department believes that oil is more likely to increase to $50 or $60 a barrel during the 12 to 24 months, than to remain at current levels. We believe the companies in our portfolio to continue to operate for a very long time with oil prices at $40 to $50 a barrel. Even if oil declined $30 a barrel they remain at that level for the next 12 to 24 months, we would expect to have any defaults during that period.", "And finally, the companies we have invested in have a variety of options they can utilize to avoid default, including but not limited to, reducing distributions to partners, drawing on lines of credit, and reducing exploration activities. We do not expect significant further downgrades in our energy portfolio. Also the recent downgrades should not impact our stock buyback program. Frank will addresses more detail when he discusses capital.", "As to investment yield in the fourth quarter, we invested $287 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average yield of 5%, an average rating of BBB plus, and an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio the first quarter yield was 5.83% down four basis points from the 5.87% yield in the first quarter of 2015. At March 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.81%.", "For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed new money rate at 5% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than we previously expected. We are disappointed interest rate have not risen as expected. However, while the continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement it will not have negative impact on the balance sheet.", "Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protected products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet.", "While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As we have said before Torchmark can thrive in either low or high-interest rate environment.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. First I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the first quarter, we spent $80 million to buy 1.5 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $53.26. So far in April we have used $21 million to purchase 392,000 shares.", "For the full-year through today, we have spent $101 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1.9 million shares at an average price of $53.38. These purchases are being made from the parent company\u2019s free cash flow. Free cash flow results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. Thus, including the $46 million available to the parent from assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have approximately $366 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.", "As previously mentioned to date we have used $101 million of this cash to buy 1.9 million Torchmark shares, leaving around $265 million of cash and other liquid assets available for the remainder of the year.", "As noted before, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain at least $50 million to $60 million of assets at the parent company, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "In early April, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of $300 million of 6.125% fixed rate, junior-subordinated debentures with a 40-year life, but callable after five years. The debt was sold pursuant to Torchmark's shelf registration statement from last August.", "The net proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to retire the $250 million outstanding principle amount, plus accrued interest on the 6.375% senior notes due June 15, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including additional capital and other financing needs if necessary at our insurance subsidiaries.", "The issuance of the debt was consistent with guidance provided to S&P as to how we would refinance the upcoming maturity and security will be treated as equity for their capital purposes. Both S&P and Moody's have assigned the same rating to the new junior subordinated security as exists on our current subordinated debentures. The issuance will have an immaterial impact on our earnings per share.", "Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the last three years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liability, and our ratings.", "As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated RBC was 317%, eight basis points below our target of 325%, primarily due to Part D earnings being lower and fourth quarter downgrades being greater than expected. During the first quarter of this year we had approximately $245 million of net downgrades on an NAIC basis within our fixed income portfolio. This amount includes total downgrades from NAIC Class I to II, II to III and III to IV, net of any upgrades during that period.", "So we don\u2019t calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. We estimate that these net downgrades will result in a decrease in our RBC percentage of approximately five basis points. This effect on RBC is consistent with the general rules of thumb we outlined last quarter. Stating that for every $100 million in downgrades, a two basis point reduction in RBC percentage would result and around $9 million of additional capital would be needed.", "The combination of the shortfall, as of the end of 2015 plus the additional capital needed due to the downgrades in the first quarter, indicates that we may need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. At this time, we did not plan on changing our targeted RBC level of 325%. However, as indicated on the last call should we believe that our RBC level as being adversely impacted by downgrades that we believe are temporary and that will reverse in the relatively near future. We may choose to temporarily target in RBC ratio below 325%.", "We are comfortable that any additional needed to meet our target RBC levels for 2016 could be funded with excess proceeds from our recent debt issuance available assets on hand, and other sources of liquidity without having to suspend or reduce the amount available for share buybacks.", "Now a few comments about Part D. On April 7, Torchmark was notified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that its two subsidiaries, UA and FUA, were released from intermediate sanctions and returned to normal marketing and enrollment status, effective as of that date. The plans had operated under sanction since August 1 of last year. While our plans will be able to accept new enrollees, we anticipate that additional sales during the remainder of 2016 will be minimal.", "We continue to proceed with the possible sale of our Part D contract and the release of these sanctions will have no impact on the Company's previously announced commitment to exit Medicare Part D business. As noted on the last call the disposition of our Part D business will release around $70 million of capital that we held at the end of 2015 relating to this business.", "Since the risk-based capital is determined primarily on the level of premiums received and claims made during the year, we will still be required to hold the majority of this capital at the end of 2016. We estimate that approximately $10 million to $15 million of capital will become available in 2016 with the remainder to be released in 2017. We will consider an extraordinary dividend of the excess capital to the parent company depending on our capital needs for 2017.", "Now with respect to our guidance for 2016, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.43 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance, $0.04 of this increase is due to the early adoption of a newly-issued accounting standard, ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.", "This new accounting standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for equity based compensation and will primarily affect our net operating income through its impact on stock compensation expense, net of taxes, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share. As required by the new standard, the adoption is prospective and thus will impact only 2016 and future periods.", "In the first quarter the Company recorded $2 million in additional tax benefits as a reduction to stock option expense in our first quarter operating earnings, as opposed to directly increasing equity, as would have occurred under prior guidance. The adoption also resulted in an increase to the weighted-average diluted shares. The net effect of the change in the first quarter was a $0.01 increase in earnings per share.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. Those are our comments; we will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Erik Bass", "Hi, thank you. I guess first question on direct response. I think on the last call you talked about targeting a margin for 2016 in the 19.5% to 20% range. And the actual margin was about 18.5% this quarter. So just wanted to get any updates on your expectations for the year for that one?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yeah Erik, our expectation for the full year hasn't changed at this point in time. The claims were a little bit higher in the first quarter just due to some seasonal fluctuations. But our outlook for the full year is still on that - around that 19.5% to 20% range.", "Erik Bass", "Okay. And then just to clarify on the debt proceeds, the extra $50 million, am I taking it right from your comments that you would expect to keep that as sort of liquidity at the holding company near term and for general corporate purposes so we may see the holding company liquidity a bit higher than $50 for a period.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, that's possible. If over the course of the year we determine that we would need some additional financing down at the insurance subsidiaries or additional capital before the end of the year, then we could use those proceeds to finance some of those operations.", "Erik Bass", "Got it. And then just one last quick one I mean you talked about the impact of the stock option expense accounting change for this year, should we think about - I don\u2019t know how should we think about the impact beyond 2016?", "Frank Svoboda", "It's really hard to determine what it may be beyond 2016, really depends on changes in share price as well as the exercise patterns within the stock option grants that we have. At this point in time, we would anticipate that they would be in the same range as what we would see for 2016.", "Erik Bass", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz", "Good morning, everybody. Just a real quickly on Part D and the recovery of delayed payments, did that come in this quarter, does it come in the second quarter?", "Frank Svoboda", "There are receivables that are coming in throughout the year that the big payment from CMS will come in, in the fourth quarter of 2016. And we anticipate that being around $100 dollars for this year.", "Steven Schwartz", "Okay. That's what I wanted to know. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Please go ahead.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Just a quick follow-up on the interest. We\u2019ll have - is it June 15 retirement you said on the old one?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s correct.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "So you\u2019ll have two and a half months of extra interest in Q2 and then it will go down fractionally Q3, Q4, is that calculated?", "Gary Coleman", "That\u2019s exactly right.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. And in your discussion on capital available for buyback, I mean you went through the $60 million possible needs for the downgrade, but then you said you might operate with a little less RBC for a bit. Was the long and the short of it don\u2019t change your buyback assumptions for now, but there a little bit of risk?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I would say we do not anticipate that we are changing our buyback assumptions. And I think what I really had attempted to indicate was that even with the level of downgrades that we've had, we don't see a significant downgrades coming in the future. We think that between the excess proceeds that we have from the debt offering and our other sources that we will be able to fund whatever capital needs we need without having the impact to share buybacks. So we would get into them at 320, we're fairly comfortable with that number.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "And you give a nice thoughtful analysis of your energy exposure and sort of like, we're not going to be facing the same number of downgrades this quarter's, we did last quarter. Was that the read? We\u2019ve got, the current environment is factored into all your commentary?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, Bob we don't see significant further downgrades for one thing that oil price is building up over $40 a year is helpful to the bonds in our portfolio. And we\u2019ve seen - I think I mentioned it, market base improved, generalized gains improved, excuse me unrealized losses improved by $37 million in the quarter. It improved even further since then. It's improved by another $52 million since the end of the first quarter, so we - all along we felt comfortable with the bonds the bonds. We feel even more comfortable with it now.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Seth Weiss", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And Frank I just want to follow-up again on the commentary on buyback and been able to use debt or other sources of liquidity to fund it if that RBC stays low for a period of time. You comment that you see the move below in RBC and sort of temporary.", "And I\u2019m curious why that\u2019s temporary, is it just if oil prices recover that'll get the bonds upgraded and the RBC back to 325. Just trying to distinguish the difference between the fundamentals of the bonds being money good and what fundamentally what make that RBC revert back to a more normal level from what you consider to be temporarily lower?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, no that is largely what we're really indicating there is that, we have had obviously some downgrades in the first quarter and the latter part of last year to the extent that the oil prices do recover, that we see the possibility and the probability that eventually those bonds would be upgraded to a higher NAIC level and requiring less RBC.", "So depending upon what we kind of see is the short-term or the long-term nature of when we think that recovery might occur that may lead us to making the decision to temporarily target an RBC level less than that 325 in anticipation of some of those future upgrades.", "Seth Weiss", "Okay. And I appreciate that. If we think about your example, and the comments around energy were helpful in the sense that the fundamentals would still be okay even if we stayed in a $30 to $40 oil range, but if that happened for a prolonged period of time, you would still see RBC lower, even if the quality of the bonds is good. So at that point, would you have to see a sacrifice to that patient buyback? I understand that 2016, we could hit that 320 number but if we look out into 2017 and we do have prolonged low period of oil, are we looking at a scenario where at some point you have to sacrifice on the buyback?", "Gary Coleman", "I would add that - what Frank was describing, where we are now, we could maybe need $60 million of capital to get to the 325%. We can - the point is we could easily do that with money that we have on hand. We don't expect significant further downgrades, but to the extent that happens, we still think we can cover that without - drawback program. One thing that Frank mentioned is that we're going to free up $70 million of capital in the next few years from Part D. That will go a long way toward helping, if there is any kind of capital shortage.", "The main thing is we don't want to put the money down on the insurance companies, unless we - until we determine we need to because once it's down there, and let's say bonds get upgraded and all of a sudden we have excess capital, it's difficult to get that excess capital back out because we have to go through the extraordinary dividend process with the states.", "So we think the best use of capital right now is to monitor it. We've got the cash available to cover any shortfall at this point. And we've got additional capital being freed up in the next two years, so if we get down the road and there is a sizable hole there, we'll fill it, but we're not at that point now. We would rather keep the money in the holding company until, until that time comes.", "Seth Weiss", "That's very helpful. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kovac", "Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to walk through the guidance update on the quarter, recognizing $0.04 for the full year is due to some of the accounting changes that you discussed. Can you sort of talk us through what the other $0.01 increase that you have in there is from? It sounded like maybe there were some headwinds on the excess investment income relative to the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit in direct response, so it sounded like you were more comfortable with that. Can you give us a sense of the moving pieces?", "Frank Svoboda", "Sure. No you\u2019re right. We've seen a little bit of that drag on the excess investment income. So where we have a little bit better of an outlook is really in our Liberty National operations. I think so we have a little bit - we've increased, if you will, where we kind of see - I think in previous guidance we had pointed that we had thought that would be, you know, the margins for the full year, you know, would be closer to 26%.", "Based on some of the experience and the claims activity that we're seeing there and throughout the first quarter, we're feeling a little bit better about that and see our underwriting margin may be getting closer to 27% on that particular, on that particular line. And then just maybe a little bit better outlook for American income as well, even though that's a little bit smaller. So it's really a little bit better underwriting on those two lines of business, offset by a little bit of a drag on the excess investment income.", "Michael Kovac", "Okay. That makes sense. And then in terms of thinking about the future growth and agency recruiting, can you give us an update on sort of generally what you're seeing in terms of future pipeline for agency recruiting?", "Larry Hutchison", "Talk about globe first, direct response. We are going to see circulation volume continue to decline in 2016 as we adjust our marketing efforts to maximize sales and profits. Currently we're expecting about a 20% decrease in circulation volume for 2016. In terms of inquiries, we think we\u2019ll see 1% to 3% increase in inquiries in electronic media.", "And we should see a 15% to 20% decline in inquiries in that media. With respect to this agency operation, we are expecting agency growth in all three agencies, projected growth at the end of the year. We think we'll have an ending agent count of American income of about 6600 agents to 6750 agents.", "Liberty national will have an increase in agents from 1625 to 1725 agents and Family Heritage - ending agent count of 912,000 agents that\u2019s incorporated in our updated sales guidance, which is increased at Liberty National, we will see an increase in life sales of 7% to 9%, net health sales of Liberty National should increase 5% to 7%.", "Our sales guidance of the American income is unchanged from last quarter. We think we\u2019ll see a 5% to 7% increase. Family Heritage was slightly lower, to 2% to 6%, because we had slower sales and lower productivity than anticipated in the first quarter.", "Michael Kovac", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. On the direct response business can you discuss just the weakness in sales and how much of that is due to a reduction in circulation on your part versus just lower success of some of the programs that you've cut on and then have a follow-up as well?", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy I wouldn\u2019t characterize the weakness of sales, this is intentional, we started to decrease circulation in the third and fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in sales expected in 2016 primarily a result of adjusted marketing activities to eliminate those unprofitable sales. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we encountered lower than expected profit margins at certain target populations where we use prescription drug data. As a result, we decreased our circulation and we decreased our mailings in profitable segments.", "Additionally, this year we\u2019ll re-price segments for our new business to reflect updated mortality. We do have initiatives to increase circulation. We've tested formats, creative content to improve our response rates and conversion rates. We're working to identify new media and finally we are trying to negotiate the best possible medium print production costs to maximize our circulation, all of which we hope will have a positive impact and we get back some of the circulations proceed through 2016.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just on your investment portfolio, how do you think about just managing your energy exposure especially the low investment grade energy? Spreads have obviously tightened recently and to the extent that tight more, what do you think about selling some of those bonds and instead reinvesting in high yield or higher grade securities or are you comfortable holding on to them?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, I think we're comfortable holding on to them for - mentioned several reasons earlier, but oil prices are up significantly over where they were at the end of the year and expectations are that there will be higher going forward. So we are buying hold and we don't see a need to sell any of them.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "All right. Thanks for joining us. Those are our comments and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2015 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, net income was $138 million or $1.13 per share, a 13% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $137 million or $1.11 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of June 30 was 11.8% and book value per share was $39.87, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.6%, and our book value per share was $31.11, an 8% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $549 million, while life underwriting margin was $144 million, up 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin lagged premium growth due primarily to higher-than-expected direct response claims. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to increase 1% to 2% over 2015. Net life sales were $110 million, up 2% from the year ago quarter.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 2% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was also up 2% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow 1% to 2%. Health sales increased 6% to $33 million. Individual health sales grew 8% to $30 million. Administrative expenses were $48 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. The primary reason for the increase in administrative expenses is increased investments in information technology. As a percentage of premiums from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.2% compared to 6.0% a year ago. For the full year, we anticipate the administrative expenses will also be around 6.2% in premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $226 million, and life underwriting margin was up 13% to $72 million. Net life sales were $55 million, up 10% due primarily to increased agent productivity. The average agent count for the second quarter was 6,599, approximately the same as a year ago, and up 6% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 6,773. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,650 to 6,850 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 9% life sales growth for the full year of 2016 [ph].", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 5% to $199 million. Life underwriting margin declined 10% to $33 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $40 million due primarily to decreases in circulation. We expect life sales to be down 5% to 7% for the full year 2016. At Liberty National, life premiums were $68 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $19 million, up 6%. Net life sales increased 12% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 13% to $5 million. The sales increases were driven primarily by improvements in agent count.", "The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,739, up 12% from a year ago, and up 13% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,812. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 9% to 12% for the full year of 2016. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 6% to 10% for the full year 2016.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $59 million. Our Health underwriting margin increased 16% to $12 million. Health net sales grew 1% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 933, down 3% from a year ago, but up 13% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 955. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1000 at the end of 2016. We expect Health sales growth to be in the range from 2% to 4% for the full-year 2016.", "At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 2% to $90 million. Net health sales were $10 million, up 6% compared to the year ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million. Our group sales declined 13% to $2 million. For the full year 2016, we expect growth in Individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% to 9%.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income; excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less the required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $55 million, a 4% decrease compared to the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income declined 2%.", "On April 5th, we issued $300 million of junior subordinated debt, primarily to refinance the $250 million debt issue that matured on June 15th. Issuing a new debt 70 days before the debt maturity resulted in a negative carry of $30 million [ph]. Excluding the negative carry, excess investment income in dollars and per share would have been up 1% and 4% respectively.", "As discussed on previous calls, the Part D segment has a negative impact on excess investment income due to negative cash flows that occurred during the year, including the long delay in receiving reimbursements from CMS for excess claims paid by the company.", "The impact of the lost investment income from the delayed receipt of reimbursements is reflected in income from continuing operations rather than in discontinued operations in accordance with applicable accounting rules. In the second quarter, Part D had a negative impact on excess investment income of approximately $2.5 million compared to negative impact of $2.3 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 1% to 2%. However on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 5% to 6%.", "At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, we're expecting a drag on excess investment income from Part D of approximately $9 million compared to a drag of $8 million in 2015.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $14.4 billion including $13.8 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. Of the fixed maturities, $13 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment grade bonds are $763 million compared to $580 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 5.5% compared to 4.4% a year ago. The increase in below investment grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades in securities in the energy and metals and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to the increases in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities were significantly higher than at the time of their downgrade.", "With a portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains of fixed maturities is 20%.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated A-, same as a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately $700 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.", "Now to complete the discussion of investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At June 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015; an improvement of $197 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.", "Regarding investment yield; in the second quarter, we invested $364 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.75%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 24 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.80%, down five basis points from the 5.85% yield in the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.79%.", "For the remainder of 2016, we have assumed a new money rate of 4.4% at the midpoint of our guidance. This rate is lower than previously expected. The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding the extended period of lower interest rates is the impact of the income statement and not the balance sheet.", "As long as we're in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on excess investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on average only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run-off each year over the next five years.", "Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement and not the balance sheet.", "Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or to put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environment.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Garry. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $83 million to buy 1.4 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $57.77. So far in July, we have used $10.6 million to purchase 174,000 shares.", "For the full year through today, we have spent $174 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 3.1 million shares at an average price of $55.77. These are being made from the parent\u2019s free cash flows. The parent\u2019s free cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark's shareholders.", "We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. With $174 million spent on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have around $146 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent.", "As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be of primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries; we currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and our ratings.", "As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower than expected capital levels as of year ended 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during the first quarter of this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. As we also discussed on the last call, and for the following reasons, we believe the shortfall may be temporary and thus may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016.", "First, we anticipate that the sale of our Medicare Part D business will generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional capital to be available for 2016, plus an additional $55 million to $60 million of additional capital that will be available in 2017. Thus, the additional capital available from this sale alone would be sufficient to offset the shortfall noted above.", "Additionally, we anticipate that certain investments that were downgraded by the NAIC in the first half of this year will be upgraded by the end of 2017. Thus, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016 and to return to our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than 2017.", "Next a few comments to provide an update on our direct response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life underwriting income, like the growth in premium primarily due to higher than expected policy obligations in our direct response operations. In previous quarters, we had seen a higher trend in policy obligations primarily due to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015. While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 to 2007 policies as anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations and anticipated for policies issued in 2011 through 2014. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage for the second quarter from the 53.5% we anticipated to 56%.", "Last quarter we indicated that policy obligations for the full year 2016 would be in the range of 52% to 53% of premium or 52.5% at the midpoint. With the additional claims experienced through June 30, we now anticipate that the direct response policy obligations for the full-year 2016 will be in the range of 54% to 55% of premiums or around 54.5% at the midpoint of this range. This 2% increase in the midpoint is primarily due to the higher expected obligations on the 2011 through 2014 policy years. As a result of the higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margin percentage for our direct response operations will be in the range of 17% to 19% for the year.", "Now a few comments about the sale of our Medicare Part D operations. Effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark entered into an agreement to sell its Medicare Part D prescription drug business to Silverscript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CVS Health. Under the terms of the agreement, Torchmark will retain all rights to the assets and liabilities as well as corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year and Silverscript will assume all rights and obligations related to the business after 2016. We will continue to administer the plans for the remainder of this year and will transition all administration to Silverscript early in 2017. The net proceeds from the sale are expected to be offset by the write off of approximately $16 million of differed acquisition cost related to Torchmark's Part D business.", "As such, the net impact of the sale is expected to be immaterial to Torchmark's financial statements. The remaining net assets reflected on the balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017. We expect that the balance of any remaining receivables to be less than $100 million by the end of 2016.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2016, we expect our net operating income from continuing operations be within a range of $4.40 per share to $4.50 per share, an 80% increase over 2015 at the midpoint.", "Those are our comments. We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. My first question is just on direct response life margins. Frank, you mentioned benefit to ratio guidance of I think 54.5% that's better than the 55.7% you had in the second quarter. So just wondering what gives you the confidence that trends in the business will get better from where they were in the second quarter?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Jimmy, we do see some higher claims in the first half of the year just due to some regular seasonality. That typically adds probably about 1% to the policy obligation percentage in the first couple of quarters of the year, so we don't see that continuing on to the second half of the year. And then just with the additional claims experience that we are seeing here now in the first half of the year, we are getting that little bit more experience with the 2011, 2012 and more on the 2013, we just had that little bit better experience to feel more comfortable with where we are going here for the remainder of the year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, and then on sales in direct response I think you mentioned that you are expecting sales to be down 5% to 7%, they are down 9% in the first half so I am assuming your - does your guidance imply that you are going to be seeing a pickup in circulation volumes in the second half of the year or is there something else that's going on there?", "Gary Coleman", "I think you will see a slowing of sale decreases, Jimmy, in the third quarter, we\u2019ll have a stronger sales decrease in the fourth quarter would be slightly down and flat from the fourth quarter.", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy, it's more because of the comparison in the third and fourth quarter are easier during the first couple of quarters.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, and then lastly on the increase in EPS guidance you raised a midpoint by about $0.02, what was the driver there?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Jimmy, on the $0.02 is in the basic increase being from the increased expectations with regard to the new accounting guidance. But the decreases that we are expecting in direct response are really being offset by really some improved outlook in several other areas of the company with respect to some of our other life operations at American Income and Liberty National as well as just a little bit better expectations with our investment income and as well as a little bit of an impact from a lower federal income tax rate as well. All those tend to offset each other, the net impact ends up being a little bit from this accounting guidance change.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And lastly if I could ask one more, on Family Heritage your results have been strong and the margins have improved in each of the last two quarters. I think this quarter was the highest margin that you've had since you have been reporting that business. So what's, is it just an aberration or have you made any changes in the product mix or anything else that are driving the improvement in margins?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, there hasn't been a change in the product mix, but what we\u2019re seeing is, we are seeing improvement in the claims and we expect that it continue for the rest of the year. Also the amortization is slightly higher than in past, that should continue. In other words we were at 21% for the quarter and year-to-date and we expect that to follow through for the year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning everybody. Just so I want to follow-up on Jimmy's question on direct response. What is it about the 2011 to 2015 vintages that's tracking maybe below your original estimates?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, as we've talked about on some of the prior calls, we had used - we started introducing the use of prescription drug database in our underwriting, starting with that 2011 year. As we understand, we were really the first to use that with respect to simplified underwriting as well as in the direct response, and to where we had expected to see some mortality improvements. Now that the claims are coming in the claims are just not coming in as favorable. Our actual experience just is not as favorable as what we had originally anticipated from the use of that prescription drug database.", "Yaron Kinar", "Right, and I do remember you discussing this in previous calls, but in previous discussions I think you were so low, I'm curious where precisely this higher claims experience was coming from if you saw any specific or you couldn't identify specific trends would then be the vintages. Are you getting maybe better clarity now as to whether it's a certain type of disease or issue that that seems to be recurring?", "Frank Svoboda", "No. We are definitely seeing certain segments where we're still getting some benefits and we're definitely seeing some segments where we are not seeing the benefits that we had anticipated. And we're able to take that knowledge and put that into play as we think about our marketing efforts going forward, in our mortality assumptions as well.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay. And so, I think you started to take some action last year already. Are the actions that you took last year self-sufficient in your view or given the fact that claims experiences deteriorated a little more than you initially expected does that means that there's maybe additional corrective action that you need to take?", "Frank Svoboda", "Well, we will continue to tweak as always when we see more, get more experience and get more information we'll continue to tweak how we utilize that information, and how we think about that, what's in our pricing and our reserve assumptions on it going forward basis. At this point in time we're comfortable with the assumptions that we've put into place with respect to the 2015 and then our 2016 business.", "Yaron Kinar", "And then with regards to headcount, I think both American Income and Liberty National showed some nice trends in the last few quarters and as I look at your guidance for it of year end, seems like maybe a little bit of flattening there. Okay, maybe talk about why you don't see the continued growth that we saw earlier.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, we look at our historical data, we believe that recurring was slow in the third quarter for both American Income and Liberty National. In the fourth quarter, really that's just seasonality, we have the holidays to deal with, so if you look at the fourth quarter over the last several years, they're showing a decline in the number of agents at the end of the fourth quarter. We're very happy with the results about the American Income, Family Heritage, and Liberty National. We've had good agent growth in the first and second quarters.", "Yaron Kinar", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hi, thanks, good morning. Regarding the debt issuance, you issued $50 million of debt in excess of the maturity. What would you expect to be the use of that $50 million of additional capital at the holding company?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, we are anticipating using that additional just to finance certain activities going on down at the insurance companies. We have some additional investments so we're making in our IT systems as well as continued growth supporting our agencies, and we anticipate to use it in that fashion.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. So you would contribute it to the subsidiaries likely?", "Frank Svoboda", "In some form or fashion.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. And then on the $9 million drag on excess investment income from Part D, is that something we should expect to get back in 2017 given the sale of the operation?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, we really should, you know, I had indicated that we expect the receivables as of the end of this year to be a little less than $100 million. We anticipate receiving those fairly ratably over the first three quarters of 2017. So, we really estimate that the drag that we'll see in 2017 to be more in the $1 million to $2 million range rather than the $8 million to $9 million that we're seeing this year.", "Gary Coleman", "And then, Ryan in 2018, there'll be no drag.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good morning, Torchmark. As we think about statutory earnings, run rate, I think you said you're growing a little faster so that's a pressure - how is credit write-offs trending through the first seven months of the year and could stat earnings grow just a little bit slower than GAAP earnings? Is my guess?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, we do, Bob. We do anticipate our statutory earnings will grow a little bit. I'm trying to think whether how to compare, how we look at that compared to the growth in the GAAP earnings but might be just a little bit slower than the GAAP earnings in 2016, we really haven't - we'll be in the process here over the next quarter to kind of look at that a little bit more closely and be able to give some guidance on that on the next call. But as far as the impairments are concerned, we do not have any impairments for the first six months of the year for statutory or GAAP purposes and right now we don't foresee any that would impact us here for the remainder of the year.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Go ahead.", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, I was just going to say we also, first quarter we had a fair amount of downgrades but we've seen improvement in the second quarter. So downgrades not maybe the issue that some people thought they would have been earlier.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. So you're feeling more relaxed about that issue on the margin?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Run rate for interest costs, I calculated about 18.8, when you get rid of the double debt costs in Q3, is that in the order of magnitude?", "Frank Svoboda", "I think on a going forward basis, we would anticipate that interest expense to be closer to probably $20 million.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "$20 million?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions.", "Mike Majors", "All right. Thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Majors, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are, Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.", "Accordingly, please refer to our 2015 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and Web site for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, net income was $152 million or $1.25 per share, a 9% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $140 million or $1.58 per share, $0.03 higher than anticipated in our previous guidance due primarily to lower than expected after-tax stock compensation expense.", "On a GAAP reported basis, our return on equity as of September 30 was 12.0%, and book value per share was $41.94. Excluding unrealized gains on fixed maturities, our return on equity was 14.7%, and our book value per share was $31.86, an 8% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $546 million, while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year ago. The decline in underwriting margin was due primarily to the decline in the direct response margin. For the full year, we expect life underwriting margin to be around 1% higher than 2015. Net life sales were $100 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $237 million, and health underwriting margin was up 6% to $53 million. For the full year, we expect health underwriting margin to grow approximately 2%. Health sales were $33 million same as in the year ago quarter. However, individual health sales were $30 million, up 9%. Administrative expenses were $49 million for the quarter, up 4% from the year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3%, same as the year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses will be around 6.2% to premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. I\u2019ll now review the results for each company. At American Income, life premiums were up 10% to $231 million, and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $74 million. Net life sales were $52 million, up 4% due primarily to increased agent count.", "The average agent count for the third quarter was 7,004, up 6% from a year ago and up 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the third quarter was 7,025. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 6,750 to 6,950 at the end of 2016. We expect 7% to 8% life sales growth for the full year 2016 at 6% to 10% in 2017.", "In our direct response operation at Globe Life, life premiums are up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 26% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $35 million due primarily to decreases in circulations. We expect life sales to be down 7% to 9% for the full year of 2016, and flat to down 5% in 2017. The further sales decline in 2017 reflects changes and marketing designed to increase the profitability of new sales.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were $67 million, down 1% from the year ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $20 million, up 9%. Net life sales increased 11% to $10 million, while net health sales increased 3% to $5 million. The sales increases were driven primarily by improvements in agent count.", "The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 1,799, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% compared to the second quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,785. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 1,700 to 1,800 at the end of 2016. Life net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 10% to 11% for the full year of 2016, and 7% to 11% in 2017. Health net sales growth is expected to be within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year of 2016, and 4% to 8% in 2017. We are very pleased with the progress as they turnaround at Liberty National.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $16 million, while health underwriting margin increased 19% to $13 million. Health net sales grew 8% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the third quarter was 986, up 9% from a year ago, and 6% from the second quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,004. We expect the producing agent count to be in a range of 975 to 1, 025 at the end of 2016. Health sales growth should be in a range of 2% to 4% for the full year 2016, and 3% to 7% for 2017.", "At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 5% to $88 million. Net health sales were $10 million, down 14% compared to the year ago quarter. Individual Medicare supplement sales grew 14% to $8 million, while Group sales declined 57% to $2 million. For the full year of 2016, we expect growth in Individual Medicare supplement sales to be around 7% to 9%. We expect sales growth in 2017 of 6% to 10%.", "I will now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I will spend the next few minutes discussing our investment operations, first, the excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income that\u2019s acquired in for some policy liabilities and debt was $57 million, a 5% increase over the year ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 9%. For the full year 2016, we expect excess investment income to grow by approximately 2%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of approximately 6%.", "Now, regarding the investment portfolio, investment assets were $14.6 billion, including $13.9 billion of fixed maturities and amortized costs. At the fixed maturities, $13.2 million are investment grade with an average rating of A minus, and below investment grade bonds are $753 million compared to $568 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.4% compared to 4.3% a year ago. The increase in below investment grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades at securities and the energy, and metals, and mining sectors in previous quarters. However, due to increases in underlying commodity prices, the current market values of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.6 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 19%. Overall, the total portfolio is rated A minus, same as the year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturities portfolio of $1.9 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than a year ago.", "To complete the discussion of investment portfolio, I'd like to give an update on our $1.6 billion of fixed maturities in the energy sector. At September 30, we had a net unrealized gain of $90 million compared to an unrealized loss of $165 million at the end of 2015, an improvement of $255 million. The average rating of the energy fixed maturities is BBB with 90% of the holdings being investment grade.", "Now, investment yield, in the third quarter, we invested $275 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.40%, an average rating of BBB, and an average life of 25 years. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 5.77%, down 4 basis-points from the 5.81% yield in the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.76%. At the midpoint of our guidance, we assume the new money rate of 4.45% in the fourth quarter, and a weighted average rate of 4.65% in 2017.", "The low and declining interest rate environment continues to be an issue. However, our concern regarding the extended period of lower interest rates is the impact on the income statement, not the balance sheet. As long as we\u2019re in this interest rate environment, the portfolio yield will continue to decline and place downward pressure on the growth of investment income. However, this decline will be lessened by the fact that on-average only about 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio will run-off each year over the next five years.", "Torchmark would continue to earn the substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. As I mentioned earlier, lower interest rates negatively impact the income statement, but not the balance sheet. Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products account for under FAS 60, we don\u2019t see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.", "In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet as our cash flow test results indicate that our reserves are more than adequate to compensate for lower interest rates. As we have said before, Torchmark can thrive in either a low or high interest rate environments.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Garry. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the third quarter, we spent $77 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $62.65. So far in October, we have used $16.4 million to purchase 255,000 shares.", "For the full year, through today, we have spent $256 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 4.4 million shares at an average price of $57.96. These are being made from the parent\u2019s free cash flows. The parent company\u2019s free cash flows, as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from their subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark\u2019s shareholders.", "We expect free cash flow in 2016 to be around $320 million. We\u2019ve $256 million spent on share repurchases. Thus far, we can expect to have around $64 million available for the remainder of the year from our free cash flow, plus other assets available at the parent. As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect the share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million to $60 million of parent assets at the end of 2016. For 2017, we preliminarily estimate that the free cash flow available to the parent will be in the range of $325 million to $335 million.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our Company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and our ratings.", "As we discussed on the last call, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis. However, we estimated that because of lower than expected capital levels as of year-end 2015 plus downgrades in our investment portfolio during this year, we would need around $60 million of additional capital to return to a 325% RBC level. As we also discussed, we believe this shortfall maybe somewhat temporary, and thus we may choose to maintain an RBC ratio slightly below 325% for 2016.", "With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital we generated from the sale of our Medicare Part D business and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels for 2016, and to meet our targeted 325% RBC ratio no later than the end of 2017, without having to utilize any of our free cash flow for capital contribution.", "Next a few comments to provide an update on our direct response operations. In the quarter, growth in total life income lagged behind the growth in premium, primarily due to higher than expected policy obligations in our direct response operations. In previous quarters, we discussed some of the higher trend in policy obligations, primarily due to higher than our originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar years 2000 through 2007, and 2011 through 2015.", "While claims this year are emerging on the 2000 through 2007 policies, largely anticipated, we are seeing higher policy obligations than anticipated for certain segments of our business issued in 2011 through 2015. The higher obligations for these policy years are the primary cause for the increase in the policy obligation percentage from the 55% we had anticipated for the third quarter to 57%.", "Last quarter, we indicated that policy obligations for the full year of 2016 would be in the range of 54% to 55% of premium, or 54.5% at the mid-point. With further analysis and additional claims experienced through September 30th, we now anticipate that the direct response in policy obligations for the full year 2016 will be around 56% of premiums at the mid-point of this range; a 1.5 percentage point increase.", "As a result of the expected higher policy obligations, we now estimate that the underwriting margins for the direct response operations will be in the range of 16% to 17% for the year. We also anticipate that the underwriting margins in 2017 will decline slightly, and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. For 2016, we expect our net operating income from continuing operations to be within a range of $4.43 per share to $4.49 per share, an 8% increase over 2015 at the midpoint. For 2017, we estimate that our net operating income per share within a range of $4.55 per share to $4.85 per share, a 5% increase at the mid-point of the guidance. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "My first question is on the direct response business. Obviously, margins have gotten worse overtime. And it seems like generally have been worse than what you have been expecting. So, what\u2019s the likelihood that results could deteriorate further in 2017, beyond what you\u2019re assuming?", "Larry Hutchison", "Well, 2017 lower sales are expected. As we continue our work to identify the appropriate balance of sales and profitability. We are confident that any marketing adjustments, which results in lower sales would have been made to improve profitability. We do have better information to make our market decisions in 2017.", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, with respect to the margins, I think as we said, we would anticipate the margins in 2017 to be in that 14% to 16% range. With the additional claims experience that we have and just some better information regarding the root causes of what\u2019s really giving rise to some of these higher claims, especially in the 2011-2015 block, we feel a lot of better clearly with respect to looking at these long-term trends and how this is going to trend out for us.", "And clearly some of these blocks, it get a little bit smaller and run-off a little bit any misses that we might have or have less and less of an impact as well going forward. But I think while some quarterly fluctuations could always impact, I think, we feel pretty good with that estimate for next year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, and then on -- go ahead.", "Larry Hutchison", "I would just say, 2017 the level of sales is a reflected testing that we completed in 2016 and 2017. And so those sales will put a greater emphasis on restoring essential levels of profitability in certain segments. The sales could be higher or lower, depending on the results of those tests.", "Gary Coleman", "Go ahead, Jimmy.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then what are you assuming for stock options expense in next year, and that\u2019s embedded in next year\u2019s guidance, because that number is obviously moved around the market as the stock prices has moved?", "Larry Hutchison", "So overall, Jimmy, the stock expense is at the midpoint of our guidance. We estimate that it would be around $1 million to $1.5 million per quarter.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just lastly besides the stock option expense and the direct response margins, what are some of the items that you feel would give you -- get you to the high-end, or versus the low end of your EPS guidance range for 2017?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, for 2017, some of the real sensitivities are obviously some money raise, especially earlier in the year, and for the remainder of \u201914 could have some impact on that. And then AIL margins, I mean it\u2019s a big enough block of business that if there were some fluctuations in the claims that we have in 2017. If you move about half of percentage point in their margin ends up being probably $0.03 worth of earnings, and then just generally on the buyback. Obviously, our expectations of free cash flow for next year looking out our projections. We\u2019d really only have statutory earnings completed through June 30th at this point in time. So the extent that that moves if that were to change significantly, something were to happen between now and the end of the year. Our stock price would have fluctuated, and that would also have some impact.", "Larry Hutchison", "As you look at the edges of the range, and I think as we\u2019ve talked about in prior years. The bottom end of that range really assumes that you have at the lower end of the margins for each of the distributions then you have some lower interest rates. And so you have a lot of things going and get you in the upper end and have -- basically at the upper end of those ranges.", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, I would add on the underwriting income, especially the life underwriting income, we\u2019ve definitely -- it has the issue with direct response. So if you remove the direct response, there is rest of our underwriting income for the last two years is, the premiums have grown 5% to 6% and the margins have grown 6% or 7%. And we expect those margins to continue to be predictable. So I still think the biggest variable is the direct response and also interest rate as well.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the John Nadel of Credit Suisse.", "John Nadel", "I was just -- I joined a little bit late, and so I apologize if you\u2019ve already cover this. But can you give us a sense for what your sales outlook is. As you look out to 2017 across the few other distribution platforms. And then separately, if I think about your 2017 guidance, how much new money do you anticipate putting to work, and maybe at the midpoint of your range, what new money investment yield that you\u2019re assuming?", "Larry Hutchison", "John, I\u2019ll address the sales projections, first for 2017. At American Income, we\u2019re projecting net sales growth for 2017 in the range 6% to 10%. At Liberty National, the net life sales should increase 7% to 11%. The net health sales should increase 4% to %. At Family Heritage, we\u2019re predicting 3% to 7% increase in health sales. In direct response, we think the sales will be flat to negative 5%. In the United American General Agency individual Medicare settlement sales, we projected sales growth of 6% to 10%.", "Gary Coleman", "John, as far as our investments for next year, we\u2019re expecting to invest just under $1 billion for the year. And we expect the rates to increase slightly as we go through the year. The weighted average rate that we\u2019re assuming for \u201917 is 4.65%.", "John Nadel", "And then I think Frank, you had mentioned that free cash flow expected to be generated for 2016 was about $320 million. I don\u2019t think there is any change to that relative to what you\u2019ve talk about the last couple of quarters. Did you mention 2017 your expectations, and do we see some benefit, I think, from proceeds from the Medicare sale?", "Frank Svoboda", "For 2017, what I indicated was around $325 million to $335 million. And there will be, embedded in that probably around $10 million to $15 million of after-tax proceeds from the sale of Part D that is helping with that to some degree.", "John Nadel", "And the expectation was, Frank, that the RBC ratio would recover to or toward at least 325% target by the end of \u201917?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, we\u2019re comfortable that we will be at or above the 325% by the end of \u201917.", "John Nadel", "And that\u2019s -- is that largely just driven by the expectation that you will just retain a bit more of your statutory earnings during the year?", "Frank Svoboda", "No, it\u2019s actually -- the combination of use of some of the debt proceeds that we have had to probably make some capital contributions between remainder of this year and into 2017. We do have, that we have talked about on the prior call, there is some capital that will be freed up from the Part D sales to probably $15 million to $20 million this year and another $50 million or so next year. So, it's really between the combination of those that -- what\u2019s really going to be driving it.", "Operator", "And from Goldman Sachs, we go next to Michael Kovac.", "Michael Kovac", "I wanted to circle back on direct response. I know in the beginning of the year mentioned that some of the elevated expenses, and elevated loss ratios, driven by the 2011 through 2014. Now it sounds like some of 2015 isn\u2019t there as well. I just wanted to see if that is in fact the case and what you are seeing in terms of how 2016 is developing for that business?", "Gary Coleman", "What we\u2019re really seeing the higher claims, in this particular year, is some increased mortality in just certain geographic and demographic segments of our business. And most of that does relate to 2011. And we are seeing a little bit of that already in the 2015 accident year. We\u2019ve really seen a spike in claims this year. Then we found was we have seen the spike in claims earlier, the first half of this year. And that was giving rise to some of our elevated guidance in the claims last quarter.", "We really did not anticipate those claims to continue on here for the remainder of the second half of the year. But we have continued to see higher claims in these particular segments of our business here in the third quarter. And so at this point in time, we do anticipate that they\u2019ll continue on through the remainder of the year.", "Michael Kovac", "And then in the 2017 guidance, does that incorporate the \u201916 continuing to develop, and how do you think about the pricing and getting in line in 2017?", "Gary Coleman", "So, for the most part, looking at our expectations of the policy obligations for 2017, we are anticipating that the claim level that we\u2019ve seeing here in 2016, for the most part, continue on into \u201917. And then as we\u2019re taking all this emerging experience and we\u2019re working that into our pricing expectations as well as our GAAP expectations really from this point going forward. So, for the remainder of 2016 and then also will be taken in account for 2017 business.", "Michael Kovac", "And then as we think about mortality more broadly this quarter in some of the other segments in AI, et cetera. How do they compare versus either typical seasonality in the third quarter?", "Larry Hutchison", "No we did see some favorable claims experience really at American Income, primarily in American Income, Liberty National, and our military businesses. All of those just had very good claims experience for the quarter.", "Gary Coleman", "I would say that American Income was a slight improvement, but it's really \u2013 this was very consistent. I think what where we\u2019ve seen most improvement is in Liberty National, and it\u2019s -- this is a favorable trend all through the year where policy obligations through Liberty for the is 36.5%, it\u2019s been there for the last four quarters, as far as that, it was up little over 38%. So, we have been pleased to see that improvement and it seems to be continuing.", "Larry Hutchison", "I would say looking forward to 2017. For 2016, at Liberty followed by Gary\u2019s comments, we expect the policy obligations somewhere in that 36% to 37% range, maybe not quite that good in 2017, maybe closer to little over 37%, something in that range, 37% to 38%.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Bob Glasspiegel of Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Couple of questions on the free cash flow numbers that you gave, I got a little confused whether the Part D proceeds were inclusive additives. And specifically for next year, is the 50 million on top of the 325% in the 325% to 335%, or is it part of the whole that you\u2019re going to get back to your 325% RBC? Or could some of that be used for buyback potentially?", "Gary Coleman", "The 50 million, Bob, is really more of a function dropping RBC levels. And so when offline using that time frame, so it\u2019s really being able to getting for the most part being able to get back to the 325% level. The free cash flow in 2017 being in the 325% to 335% range, that\u2019s really is based upon the distribution of our statutory earnings from 2016. And embedded in a portion of that statutory earnings from 2016 are the after-tax proceeds of the sale of the Part D.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "So the 325% to 335% has the 50 million -- has the proceeds?", "Gary Coleman", "Has the proceeds....", "Bob Glasspiegel", "But not the RBC freed up?", "Gary Coleman", "That is correct.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Now, I got you. And then the RBC that\u2019s freed up, that\u2019s worth 50 million next year. Is that going to be used for the whole? There is two 325s, we\u2019re talking about the RBC, all of 325? Or can some of that be used for buyback on top of the free cash flow?", "Gary Coleman", "Right now, Bob, our projections are looking. It looks like it will be more used to fill the RBC hole, more so than being available to be able to distribute that in excess of normal statutory earnings.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "So some of it\u2019s for buyback, but not the majorities, what you\u2019re saying?", "Gary Coleman", "I would say that we\u2019re not really anticipating being able to distribute out any of the $50 million of capital that we\u2019re freeing up from the sale.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Administrative expense this year has been a little bit heavy for IT expenses. Does it continue with the same rate next year, incrementally? Or could it grow a little bit slower than the revenues?", "Frank Svoboda", "It's going to be about the same. That type of growth will be about the same as we have for revenues. So this year or for the quarter it was, administrative expense were 6.3% of premium, but they should end the year at 6.2%. And we\u2019re projecting for next year that it's going to be 6.2% to 6.3% of premiums. So, there is simply growth in the administrative expense, but it's going to match the growth in the premium.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "The tax rate was a little low this quarter as it was last quarter. Was that the option element floating through? Or is there something else going on in the tax rate?", "Gary Coleman", "The tax rate was down, really start of last quarter, where there was some of the non-deductable expenses. But we\u2019ve had, ACA as an example of that. We\u2019re really lower than we\u2019ve had in some of the prior quarters. And so if those become reduced, that reduce the tax rate. It really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the excess tax benefit on the stock options as that\u2019s being on our operating summary netted against the stock option expense.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Is this the new good run rate, or was it unusually low?", "Gary Coleman", "No. I think for the most part, we\u2019re really looking at that 32% from an operating tax perspective, it was 32% to 32.8%, somewhere in there 32.7%, somewhere in there, continuing on into 2017.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Seth Weiss of Bank of America.", "Seth Weiss", "My question is on the cash flow numbers and your projection of cash flow, and if we look a couple of years ago, you had generally guided to cash flow numbers in the $360 million to $370 million range. And that number has obviously come down over the last couple of years, more like $320 million, if we take out the proceeds from Part D sales this year. I know that there's several things going on with Direct Response and timing of the CMS reimbursements. I was just hoping you could walk us through why we've had to step-down in free cash flow? And if it's something that we should think of as more temporary, or if this is a new run rate that we may grow slightly off of in the future.", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, I think the decline from 2015 to 2016 statutory earnings, which are really because of our -- the decline of the free cash flow from that $360 million that you\u2019re mentioning to where we\u2019re at $320 million for this year. It\u2019s really been driven by a couple of factors; one of it was the higher direct response claims as well as some of the lowering of the Part D margin that we had over the course of time. Clearly, some of the higher direct response claims had an impact on our statutory earnings. Probably about a third of that decline is just from really good sales that we\u2019ve had in the past couple of years.", "And so as we grow sales, and we\u2019re growing sales at 8%, 9%, 10%, that generate a significant amount of first year statutory strengths. If you have that over a several years, then the process that are being generated from those sales start to catch up to it and help to then grow the statutory earnings going forward. And then there is some other factors, just the higher -- our higher IT expenses, general administrative expenses. We\u2019ve had some ups and downs on the tax rate perhaps.", "For the most part, and what we kind of see here for going forward as well I think that for 2017, the direct response is continuing to have a little bit more of an impact. I think what you\u2019ll see as far as not having to grow from \u201815 to \u201916, or \u201916 to \u201917. But I think in the near term, and for 2017 statutory earnings, I would not expect that would be significantly different than what you\u2019re seeing really at today\u2019s levels.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Majors, I would like to turn the conference back over to for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "All right. Thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments. And we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Majors, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are, Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel. Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only.", "Accordingly, please refer to our 2015 10-K and any subsequent forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.", "I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, net income was $135 million or $1.12 per share, a 5% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $139 million or $1.15 per share, a per share increase of 10% from a year ago.", "On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 12% and book value per share was $37.76 excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities. Return on equity was 14.6% and book value per share was $32.13, a 7% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 6% to $550 million while life underwriting margin was $143 million, down 1% from a year. The decline in underwriting margin is due primarily to the decline in the direct response margins. In 2017, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 1% to 3%. Net life sales were $99 million, approximately the same as a year ago quarter.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 1% to $238 million and health underwriting margin was up 4% to $53 million. In 2017, we expect health underwriting income to remain relatively flat. Health sales in total were $47 million down 21% from year ago. Individual health sales was $37 million down 4%.", "The administrative expenses were $50 million for the quarter up 6% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.4% compared to 6.3% a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were $197 million or 6.3% of premium. In 2017, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5% and to remain around 6.3% of premium.", "I'll now turn the call over to Larry Hutchison for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. At American Income life premiums were up 11% to $236 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $75 million and life sales were $52 million up 3% due primarily to increased agent count.", "The average agent in the fourth quarter was 6,874 up 4% from a year ago and down 2% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,870. We expect the producing count to be in the range of 7,100 to 7,400 at the end of 2,017. Life sales for the full year 2016 grew 6%. We expect 6% to 10% life sales for 2017.", "At Liberty National life premiums were $67, approximately the same as the year ago quarter, while life underwriting margin was $19 million down 4%. Net life sales increased 15% to $10 million while net health sales were $5 million, approximately the same as the year ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count.", "The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,781 up 16% from a year ago and down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 1,758. We expect the producing agent count to be in the range of 1800 to 2,000 and the end of 2017.", "Life net sales for the full year 2016 grew 12%. Life net sales growth is expected to be within the range of 8% to 12% for the full year 2017. Health net sales for the full year 2016 grew 8%. Health net sales growth in 2017 is expected to be between the range of 5% to 9%.", "We are enthusiastic about Liberty National's prospects. Life premiums grew on a year-over-year basis for both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016. The last time we had year-over-year growth per quarter was in 2004, while the fourth quarter growth was slight, there is an indicator of the positive effect of the changes that remained at this agency. We expect to seek assistance life premium growth at Liberty National going forward.", "I would like to make one more comment regarding American Income and Liberty National. Roger Smith who overseas both of these agencies announced he will retire at the end of the year. Roger has contributed greatly to the growth of American Income and the turnaround of Liberty National.", "Over the past several years, Roger has developed talented leaders at both American Income and Liberty National. Steve Brewer, the President of American Income agency division will succeed Roger at American income. Steve has served in his current capacity for over a year who was in SGA for American Income for 12 years prior to that.", "Steven DiChiaro, President of the Liberty Natalie Agency Division, will succeed Roger at Liberty National. Steve has served in his current capacity for over five years, who was in SGA at American Income before that. Roger will serve in an advisory capacity for both agencies after his retirement.", "Now direct response, in our direct response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 4% to $192 million. Life underwriting margin declined 21% to $29 million. Net life sales were down 7% to $34 million. For the full year 2016, life sales declined 9% due primarily to decreases in circulation designed to improve profitability at certain segments.", "We expect life sales were down 4.5 to 9.5% in 2017 as we continue those efforts. At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $61 million, while health underwriting margin increased 26% to $14 million.", "Health net sales grew 8% to $13 million, but the average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 947, up 8% from a year ago and down 40% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 909. We expect the producing agent count to be in the range of 950 to 1,050 at the end of 2017.", "Health sales for the full year 2016 were 2%. We expect health sales growth to be in the range from 3% to 7% in 2017. At United American General agency, health premiums declined 2% to $89 million, net health sales were $24 million, down 38% compared to the year ago quarter.", "Individual Medicare supplement sales for the full year 2016 declined 3%. In 2017 we expect growth in Individual Medicare supplement sales to be approximately 5%.", "I'll now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I'll spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, I'll talk about excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income as acquired interest on policy liabilities and debt was $58 million an 8% increase over the year ago quarter.", "On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 12%. In 2017, we expect excess investment income to grow by about 6% to 8%. However, on a per share basis, we should see an increase of about 9% to 11%.", "Now regarding Investment Portfolio, invested assets were $14.8 million, including $14.2 million of fixed maturities and amortized cost. At the amortized cost, $13.4 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus and below investment grade bonds are $751 million compared to $640 million a year ago.", "The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 5.3% compared to 4.8% a year ago. The increase in global investment grade bonds is due primarily to downgrades in securities in the energy and mills and mining sectors that occurred earlier in 2016.", "However, due to the increase in the underlying commodity prices, the current market value of these securities are significantly higher than at the time of the downgrades. With a portfolio leverage of 3.7 times, the percentage of below grade bonds to equity excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 19%.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated high BBB plus just slightly under the A minus a year ago. In addition, net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.1 billion, approximately $550 million higher than a year ago.", "Regarding investment yield, in the fourth quarter we invested $607 in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.58% and average rating of BBB plus at an average life of 26 years. For the entire portfolio fourth quarter yield was 5.75% down six basis points from the 5.81% in the fourth quarter 2015. At December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.74%.", "For 2017, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.80% for the full year. We are encouraged by the prospect of our interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income.", "We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, it rates don't rise, the continued low interest rate environment will impact the income statement but not the balance sheet as we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products account for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that will require us to write off the ACE or put up addition GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations.", "In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess and disciplined income in an extended low interest rate environment.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter we spend $71 million to buy $1.0 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $68.60.", "For the full year, we spent $311 million of parent company cash to acquire 5.2 million shares at an average price of $59.78. So far in 2017, we have spent $19 million to purchase 257,000 shares.", "The parent ended the year with liquid assets of about $45 million. In addition to these liquid asset, the parent will generate additional free cash flow in 2017. The parent company's free cash flow as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark's shareholders.", "While our 2016 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect free cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Thus, including the assets on hand, at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $370 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year. This level of free cash flow in 2007 is slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to the net proceeds received in 2016 from the sale of our Medicare Part D business.", "As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "Now, regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our company in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "Although we have not finalized our 2016 statutory financial statements, we expect that our consolidate RBC ratio -- RBC percentage at December 31, 2016, will be around 325%. We do not anticipate any changes to our target RBC levels in 2017.", "Next a few comments to provide an update on our direct response operations. During 2016, the growth in total life underwriting income lagged behind the growth in premium, due to higher than expected policy obligations in our direct response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is attributable to higher than originally expected claims related to policies issued in calendar year 2000 through 2007 and 2011 through 2015.", "During the fourth quarter, claims emerged as anticipated and policy obligations were in the range we expected for the fourth quarter and consistent with those reported for the third quarter. In addition, at 16.5% of premiums, the underwriting margin for the full year 2016 fell within the 16% to 17% range we expected. Looking forward and as indicated on the last call, we anticipate that the underwriting margin for 2017 will decline slightly and be in the range of 14% to 16% of premium for the full year.", "Now with regard to the recognition of excess tax benefits on equity compensation. As we previously discussed in the first quarter of 2016, the company adopted the new accounting standard relating to the treatment of excess tax benefits on a prospective basis. This new accounting standard primarily causes excess tax benefits to be recognized through earnings and affects Torchmark's computation of net income, diluted shares outstanding and earnings per share.", "In the fourth quarter, the reduction in expense related to the adoption of the standard caused earnings per share from continuing operations to increase $0.04. During the full year 2016, earnings per share increased $0.13. While several factors did fell in the amount of excess tax benefits, we anticipate that the excess tax benefits recognized in 2017 will be slightly less than 2016 and a stock expense as reflected in net operating income will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million for the year compared to a benefit of $1.5 million in 2016, a negative swing of $3.5 million to $5.5 million.", "Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2017, we're projecting net operating income from continuing operations per share to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.77. The $4.67 midpoint of this range reflects a $0.03 decrease from the midpoint of our previous guidance.", "This decrease is due to a $0.05 reduction resulting from the higher current share price, which is causing the number of shares expected to be repurchased in 2017 to be lower than anticipated at the time of our last call. The negative effect of the higher share price is offset somewhat by a slightly improved outlook for underwriting and investment income. Much speculation exist that Congress will enact some type of tax reform in 2017.", "At this time, few details are known as the direction to Congress will ultimately take including what statutory rate might be agreed to and what if any changes to the tax base might occur. As such we are not reflected any possible changes in the tax law in our 2017 earnings guidance and our calculations to that existing tax law will stay in effect through 2017.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Those are our comments. We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "All right. First I had a question on the annuity business, you\u2019ve had pretty strong underwriting income in each of the last two quarters. What really drove that and I'm assuming it's lower amortization and stuff, but what really drove it and what's your expectation of a more normalized ongoing earnings number for that business?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah. Hi, Jimmy. You're right that the increased income from the annuity business relates to lower amortization, but we slowed down the amortization of that business due to it staying on the books longer due to the lower interest rate environment, but going forward at the midpoint of our guidance, we see annuity income probably being in that $10 million range pretty similar to what we saw on a per quarter basis to what we have in the fourth quarter.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then I think you mentioned retaining $50 million of liquidity at the holding company. In the past, I thought it was $50 million to $60 million. So not sure, has there been a change or is still consistent with what you were planning before?", "Gary Coleman", "Generally consistent, but I think looking realistically that we probably be at the lower end of that range, given our starting point where we ended up in 2016 a little below $50 million just really due to some timing of some items.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then at the final numbers in terms of sales proceeds from the Part D block, do you have the final numbers on what you are expecting to get from the Part D sale?", "Gary Coleman", "The numbers are totally finalized until after the end of the first quarter.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay.", "Gary Coleman", "We did receive -- right now we estimate that the proceeds will be around $18 million, but probably to a little bit of adjustment still through the first quarter.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "And then just lastly, how do you think about the impact of the exit on your investment income? I'm assuming at some point down the road, it should help your investment income. How do you think about how it affected this year, next year and the year after?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes, as the exit of the business occurs, we will receive the various receivables that we have on the Part D business. We did see a pickup here in 2016 as we collected a significant portion of our CMS receivables here in 2016. As of the end of 2016, we still have around $100 million of net receivable from that business. We expect to probably get around $80 million of that in 2017 and that will be fairly pro-rata over the course of the year.", "And then it looks like there'll be a little bit of detail on the final $20 million or so that we don't anticipate to receive from CMS until probably the end of 2018, just there is some review process as it takes a couple of years to exit the business.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "So more normal number yield it will take till '19 to get to a more normal number on investment income and no lag effect from this?", "Gary Coleman", "Ultimately yes, so there is a little bit of a drag that we're going to see here in 2017. Probably around the $2 million to $3 million range of a net drag, but then ultimately it will be cleaned up for the most part by the end of the year into '19.", "Larry Hutchison", "But Jimmy that's a comparison, excuse me, the drag in 2016 was $9 million. So, we hope for $9 to $2 million to $3 million.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good morning Torchmark, direct response margins were flat sequentially, but you're guiding to further decline from the Q4 run rate in the 2017, have we turned the corner there or is it still a little bit of marginal deterioration?", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah Bob, I think we do anticipate having a little bit of marginal deterioration in 2017. And just to add, the 2002 through 2014 years related to RX business that we primarily do on the RX business that we talked about in the past as that really go through it's maturity if you will in its higher years and then and then starts to decline as an overall percentage of our premium.", "Looking past 2017 we really see it stabilizing for the most part in maybe that 14% to 15% range. So, there might be just a slight deterioration past 2017, but at this point in time, it\u2019s really difficult to determine exactly until we see what impact the changes that we made at the end of '16 and on our 2017 sales will ultimately have.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Thank you. And one quick follow-up on the guidance on news rates for 2017 up 4.8. How does that compare to what you're getting today? Do we need a further increase in rates to get there?", "Gary Coleman", "No. Excuse me Bob, am battling a cold here. As we mentioned we invested 458 in the fourth quarter. So, for in this quarter, we are a little bit above what we thought where it would be -- we are in the high 480 range. What we contemplated is that the first quarter be around 470 and then would ratchet up to toward the end of the year it would be more -- just little under 5%. We now our goal to have to get to 480. We are little ahead of the game in the first part of the first quarter and of course we hope that continues.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. You said you're getting above 480 now, I missed\u2026.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah. Little above 480 right now.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Appreciated. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to John Nadel with Credit Suisse.", "John Nadel", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. If I look at amortized cost of your invested assets, I am thinking about the excess investment income calculation, you ended '16 with about $14.2 billion. I know there is a bunch of different cash flows, how much do you think that should -- should we be thinking about that growing in that 2% to 3% range annually or does there -- do we get a bump up with some of these proceeds?", "Gary Coleman", "Okay. John, you're talking about the growth in the fixed maturities assets?", "John Nadel", "The $14.2 billion of invested assets in your excess investment income count?", "Gary Coleman", "Yes. I think you can -- we\u2019re looking at growth of 4% to 5% in the next two to three years.", "John Nadel", "Okay. Each year.", "Gary Coleman", "Yeah, each year, right.", "John Nadel", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I have a -- I guess this is more of a hypothetical question. I understand your guidance doesn't contemplate any changes in statutory tax rates, that seems sensible even if something happens, it doesn't feel like it\u2019s going to happen that soon.", "But hypothetically if domestic tax rates, corporate tax rates fell from 35% I don\u2019t know, pick a number 20% or 25% or even lower, do you expect to be able to capture all that to the bottom line or would you expect to price new product sales differently perhaps generate a faster pace of sales growth and still target of similar after-tax ROE just recognizing that your profit margin, a greater proportion of your profit margin might come from a lower tax rate, you understand that -- I don\u2019t know if I am phrasing that very well?", "Gary Coleman", "I think John I understand, I believe what your question is, it\u2019s really hard to say with respect to the impact of the sales might happen and we obviously really haven\u2019t spent any time really thinking about how we might adjust the pricing at all with respect to changing the tax rates.", "We would clearly see and would just say if tax rates were to decrease to 25%, we would expect there to be a decrease in the cash taxes we pay, but at this point in time we really don't know what change they might make on -- to the tax base to ease into that to some degree.", "John Nadel", "Understood.", "Gary Coleman", "We would and we should end up having a benefit on the GAAP side clearly. On the statutory side, it's a little bit more difficult to see exactly how that might materialize and how that might impact future cash flows if you will.", "John Nadel", "Okay. I'm just curious -- it's more of a I guess a bit of a philosophical question right because I suppose at the end of the day, lower corporate tax rate is intended to help the consumer and grow the economy faster and so in that respect I guess I am wondered if you would target a higher ROE recognizing a lower tax rate or if you would just look to pass along savings in the form of a lower premium rate to customers.", "Gary Coleman", "Well, John, in our businesses the direct response we will consider more than others because there is more price competitive there. In our agency operations, it's not that price competitive. So, I think we would be careful about what we did with those premiums.", "John Nadel", "Okay. Understood. All right.

Please go ahead, Mike.", "Mike Majors", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining the call today are Gary Coleman and Larry Hutchison, our Co-Chief Executive Officers; Frank Svoboda, our Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Mitchell, our General Counsel.", "Some of our comments or answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2016 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC. Some of our comments may also contain non-GAAP measures. Please see our earnings release and website for a discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, net income was $140 million or $1.18 per share, a 4% increase on a per share basis. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $142 million or $1.19 per share, a per share increase of 7% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of June 30 was 11.4%, and book value per share was $42.55. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 14.3% and book value per share was $33.49, an 8% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 5% to $574 million, and life underwriting margin was $147 million, a 3% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin continues to life premiums growth due primarily to the Direct Response segment, as we have discussed in previous calls. For the year, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 2% to 4%.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 2% to $243 million, while health underwriting margin was up 5% to $55 million. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due primarily to favorable claims experience. For the year, we expect health underwriting income to grow 1% to 3%.", "Administrative expenses were $51 million for the quarter, up 6% from a year ago, and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premiums from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.3% compared to 6.2% a year ago. For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to remain around 6.3% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $247 million and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $80 million. Net life sales were $57 million, up 3%, due primarily to increased agent count. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 7,009, up 6% from a year ago, and up 4% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the second quarter was 7,170.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were up 1% to $68 million while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 13% to $12 million while net health sales were $5 million, down 3% from the year-ago quarter. The life sales increase was driven primarily by improvements in agent count. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,004, up 15% from a year-ago and up 10% compared to the first quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. Once again, we are very pleased with the results at Liberty National.", "In our Direct Response operation at Global Life, life premiums were up 2% to $203 million. Life underwriting margin declined 12% to $30 million. Net life sales were down 9% to $37 million. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is by design. We have decreased circulation in order to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 7% to $63 million and health underwriting margin increased 11% to $14 million. Health net sales grew 4% to $14 million. The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 1,035, up 11% from a year ago, and up 16% from the first quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,030. We continue to be enthusiastic about the positive performance at Family Heritage.", "At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 1% to $91 million. Net health sales were $13 million, up 26% compared to the year-ago quarter. Individual Medicare Supplement sales were up 4%, and group sales increased from $2 million to $5 million. To complete my discussion on the marketing operations, I\u2019ll now provide some forward-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2017 to be in the following ranges: American Income 7,100 to 7,500; Liberty National 2,000 to 2,200; Family Heritage 970 to 1,070.", "Life net sales trends for the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: American Income 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National 14% to 18% growth; Direct Response 6% to 9% decline. Health net sales trends for the full year 2017 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National flat to 4% decline; Family Heritage 7% to 11% growth; United American individual Medicare supplement flat to 5% growth.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was $62 million, a 13% increase over the year-ago quarter. On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 18%. The higher within normal increase is due primarily to the following factors. First, interest expense was higher in the second quarter of 2016 due to debt issued early in that quarter, refinancing those that did not mature until later in the quarter.", "And also investment income in 2017 is higher because the negative impact from the lengthy delays of receiving party reimbursements has declined. For the second half of the year, we expect excess investment income to grow around 5% and excess investment income per share grow around 9% to 10%.", "Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.3 billion, including $14.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost. Of the fixed maturities, $14 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $672 million compared to $763 million a year ago. The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.6% compared to 5.5% a year ago. With a portfolio leverage of 3.7x the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, is 17%.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, just slightly under the A- a year ago. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $1.7 billion, approximately the same as a year ago.", "As to investment yield. In the second quarter, we invested $154 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.90%, an average rating of BBB+ and an average life of 20 years. For the entire portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.68%, down 12 basis points from the 5.80% yield in the second quarter of 2016. As of June 30, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.68%.", "In the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new money rate of 4.80% for the remainder of the year. We are still hoping to see higher interest rates going forward. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income. We are not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity. However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet.", "Since we primarily sell non-interest sensitive protection products accounted for under FAS 60, we don't see a reasonable scenario that would require us to write-off DAC or put up additional GAAP reserves due to interest rate fluctuations. In addition, we do not foresee a negative impact on our statutory balance sheet. While we would benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment. Those are my comments to the investments.", "I will now turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks, Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the second quarter, we spent $81 million to buy $1.1 million Torchmark shares at an average price of $75.89. So far in July, we have used $5 million to purchase 65,000 shares at an average price of $77.45. Thus for the full year through today, we have spent $168 million of Parent Company cash to acquire more than 2.2 million shares at an average price of $76.08. These purchases are being made from the Parent Company\u2019s excess cash flow.", "The Parent Company's excess cash flow, as we define it, results primarily from the dividends received by the Parent from the subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the interest paid to Torchmark\u2019s shareholders. We expect the Parent Company's excess cash flow in 2017 to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. With $168 million debt on share repurchases thus far, we can expect to have $157 million to $162 million available for the remainder of the year from our excess cash flow plus other assets available to the Parent.", "As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of Parent assets at the end of 2017, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "Now regarding RBC at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings.", "At December 31, 2016, our consolidated RBC was 324%. Although, we do not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we are still planning to target a 2017 consolidated RBC ratio of", "325%.", "Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. During the second quarter of 2017, the growth in total life underwriting income continue to lag behind the growth in premium due to higher policy obligations in our Direct Response operations. As discussed on previous calls, this is mostly attributable to higher obligations related to policies issued in calendar years 2011 through 2015.", "On our last call, we noted that we anticipated the margin for the full year of 2017 to range between 14% to 16%. For the second quarter, the margin was 15%, fully in line with our expectations for the quarter. We still anticipate the margin for the full year to range between 14% to 16%.", "Now with respect to our guidance for 2017. We are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $4.70 to $4.80 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $4.75 midpoint of this guidance reflects a $0.05 increase over our previous guidance. The increase is primarily attributed to an improved outlook for underwriting income as well as an increase in investment income. Those are my comments.", "I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan Chase.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. Obviously pretty strong results overall but the Direct Response business, the sales have stayed weak, despite easy comps. So you mentioned the reduction in circulation. Have you fully pulled back from marketing in segments, that you\u2019ll be emphasizing or when do you reach that point where you would have fully sort of limited your marketing efforts and beyond reach you could started growing?", "Larry Hutchison", "Jimmy for 2017, we expect our insert media inquiries to be down about 12% to 15%, for electronic inquiries will be about 5% and electronic inquiries represent about two-thirds of the inquiries receive today, so we\u2019re seeing some positive in the marketing. The circulation for the year, we got about 12% to 15%, mail volumes will be flat to down \u2013 down slightly, I think that will be doing in late 2018 or 2019 will begin to positive sales growth going forward. As our margins return to acceptable levels, we will expand our marketing efforts to increase sales. As you know those positive sales will occur as we use the [indiscernible] and better segmentation to identify the best responding, much profitable consumers within each segment of our business.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then on \u2013 just obviously there is uncertainty about what\u2019s happening with Medicare but what are your expectations under the current administration in terms of changes in reimbursement rates on med advantage plans and whether or not that helps demand for MedSup plans?", "Gary Coleman", "Brian, do you want to answer that question?", "Brian Mitchell", "Sure, Jimmy, we are constantly reviewing the proposals that come from Capitol Hill, as of the current time, none of the proposals seem to be gear that way to doing away with the original Medicare. With regard to your question as to reimbursements, again that\u2019s up in the air, we do anticipate the possibility of increased reimbursements going forward into the next year but nothing certainly at this point.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Coad with Autonomous Research.", "Matt Coad", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As you noted earlier, it\u2019s a strong quarter in-house with the underwriting margin of 5% and thanks for the updated guidance. That updated guidance however emphasizes a 1% or 2% increase in the margin in 3Q and 4Q. So can you just provide some color on what cost do you outperformance this quarter and why you don\u2019t expect it to be sustainable?", "Gary Coleman", "Matt, I think in your question ultimately was looking at little bit higher than \u2013 higher margins on the \u2013 from the health business in the first half of the year, we are not really seeing that in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s right, largely with respect to both Liberty and American Income we did see some favorable claims in the second quarter that we just not really seeing continuing on for the full year.", "Matt Coad", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, this is Frank. I do need to clarify in my opening comments in excluding the excess capital I accidently indicated that our excess cash flow was our dividends \u2013 yes, the dividends received from its subsidiary less the interest paid on debt and it should be the dividends paid to the Torchmark\u2019s shareholder. I think I accidently said interest on our Torchmark\u2019s shareholder. I just want to clarify that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, there\u2019s no further questions in our queue. I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mike Majors", "Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning.

Please see our earnings release and website for discussion of these terms and reconciliations to GAAP measures.", "I'll now turn the call over to Gary Coleman.", "Gary Coleman", "Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, net income was $1.27 billion or $8.71 per share, compared to $135 million or $1.12 per share a year ago. The increase is due primarily to the reduction of the parity contacts liabilities, resulting from the tax legislation passed late in 2017.", "While we view tax reform as being very beneficial to Torchmark and its shareholders in the long run, the positive impact of the new lower tax rates on current taxes paid will be largely offset by the expanded tax base over the next several years. Frank will discuss this in more detail in his comments. Without the impact of tax reform, net income for the fourth quarter would have been $153 million or $1.30 per share.", "Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $147 million or $1.24 per share, a per share increase of 8% from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, return on equity as of December 31 was 28.2% and book value per share was $52.95. Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities and the impact of tax reform, return on equity was 14.4%, and book value per share was $34.68, an 8% increase from a year ago.", "In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 6% to $581 million and life underwriting margin was $160 million, up 12% from a year ago. Growth in underwriting margin exceeded the premium growth, due primarily to favorable results in direct response and to a lesser extent, American Income. In 2018, we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4% to 5%.", "On the health side, premium revenue grew 3% to $246 million, while health underwriting margin was up 4% to $55 million. In 2018, we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3% to 5%.", "Administrative expenses were $55 million for the quarter, up 9% from a year ago and in line with our expectations. As a percentage of premium from continuing operations, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% a year ago.", "For the full year, administrative expenses were $211 million or 6.4% of premium. In 2018, we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 6%, and to remain around 6.5% of premium.", "I will now turn the call over to Larry for his comments on the marketing operations.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Gary. At American Income, life premiums were up 9% to $258 million and life underwriting margin was up 14% to $86 million. Net life sales were $56 million, up 7% due primarily to higher agent productivity.", "The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 6,959, up 1% from a year ago and down 3% from the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the fourth quarter was 6,880. Life sales for the full year 2017 grew 6%.", "At Liberty National, life premiums were up 2% to $69 million, while life underwriting margin was down 3% to $18 million. Net life sales increased 19% to $12 million, while net health sales were $6 million, up 21% from the year-ago quarter. The sales increase was driven primarily by growth in agent count and worksite activity.", "The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 2,112, up 19% from a year ago, but down 1% compared to the third quarter. The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,106. Life net sales for the full year 2017 grew 17%. Health net sales for the full year 2017 grew 5%.", "In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 4% to $199 million. Net life sales were down 15% to $29 million. For the full year of 2017, life sales declined 10%.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, the sales decline is intentional. We have made operational changes designed to improve profitability in certain segments. Our primary marketing focus is to grow overall new business profits by maximizing margin dollars rather than emphasizing sales levels or margins as a percentage of premium. We are pleased with the increase in profit margins.", "At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 8% to $65 million and health underwriting margin increased 9% to $15 million. Health net sales grew 12% to $15 million. The average producing agent count for the fourth quarter was 1,026, up 8% from a year ago and approximately the same as the third quarter. The producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1,076. Health sales for the full year 2017 grew 10%.", "At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% to $92 million. Net health sales were $28 million, up 17% compared to the year ago quarter, due to increases in both the group and individual Medicare supplement units.", "To complete my discussion for the market operations, I'll now provide some forward-looking information. We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2018 to be in the following ranges; American Income, 7,000 to 7,400; Liberty National, 2,300 to 2,500; Family Heritage, 1,125 to 1,185.", "Approximate life net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows; American Income, 6% to 10% growth; Liberty National, 11% to 15% growth; Direct Response, 1% to 9% decline.", "Health net sales trends for the full year 2018 are expected to be as follows; Liberty National, 1% to 5% growth; Family Heritage, 3% to 7% growth; United American Individual Medicare supplement, 4% to 8% growth.", "I'll now turn the call back to Gary.", "Gary Coleman", "I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations. First, excess investment income. Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $58 million, a 1% decrease over the year ago quarter. The decrease is due in part to the negative carry from the earlier refinancing of a debt issue.", "On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income was up 2%. In 2018, we expect excess investment income to grow around 3%. However, on a per share basis, we expect the increase to be around 6% to 7%.", "In our investment portfolio, invested assets were $15.8 billion, including $15 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost. Out of the fixed maturities, $14.3 billion are investment grade, with an with average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds were $702 million compared to $751 million a year ago.", "The percentage of low investment grade bonds of fixed maturities is 4.7%, compared to 5.3% a year ago. And with a portfolio leverage of 3.2 times, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities is 15%.", "Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as the year ago quarter. In addition, we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2 billion, approximately $916 million higher than a year ago.", "Regarding investment yield. In the fourth quarter, we invested $262 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in industrial sectors. We invested at an average yield of 4.36%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years.", "For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 5.61%, down 14 basis points from the 5.75% yield in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of December 31st, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.60%.", "For 2018, the midpoint of our current guidance assumes an increasing new money yield throughout the year, averaging 4.75% for the full year. We were encouraged by the prospect of higher long-term interest rates. Higher new money rates will have a positive impact on operating income by driving up excess investment income.", "We're not concerned about potential unrealized losses that are interest rate-driven, since we would not expect to realize them. We have the intent, and more importantly, the ability to hold our investments to maturity.", "However, if rates don't rise, a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement, but not the balance sheet.

While we would definitely benefit from higher interest rates, Torchmark would continue to earn substantial investment income in an extended low interest rate environment.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Svoboda", "Thanks Gary. First, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position. In the fourth quarter, we spent $82 million to buy 950,000 Torchmark shares at an average price of $86.06. For the full year 2017, we spent $325 million of parent company cash to acquire 4.1 million shares at an average price of $78.67.", "So far in 2018, we have spent $26.8 million to purchase 292,000 shares. These purchases are being made from the parent company's excess cash flow. The parent ended the year with liquid assets of $48 million.", "In addition to these liquid assets, the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2018. The parent company's excess cash flow as we define it, results primarily from the dividend received by the parent from its subsidiaries, less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to Torchmark shareholders.", "While our 2017 statutory earnings had not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million. Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we currently expect to have around $378 million to $380 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent during the year.", "As noted on previous calls, we will use our cash as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds. We also expect to retain approximately $50 million of parent assets at the end of the year -- end of 2018, absent the need to utilize any of these funds to support our insurance company operations.", "Next, a few comments on the new tax legislation. As you know, on December 22nd, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21% and makes other changes affecting the Tax Law.", "Overall, the legislation will provide significant long-term benefits to Torchmark, since the future profits of the business will be taxed at the lower rate, benefiting our long-term shareholders.", "The tax rate reduction required the company to make a one-time adjustment to reduce the deferred income tax liability carried on the GAAP financial statements. This adjustment, along with other one-time adjustments, resulted in a non-recurring GAAP tax benefit of $874 million recorded in the fourth quarter, approximately $275 million of which related to unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments. The entire $874 million adjustment was treated as a non-operating item.", "But as noted earlier by Gary, increased the GAAP net income per share significantly. The task adjustment also increased our book value per share in December 31st, 2017 by $5.09 or approximately 15%.", "Looking forward, we expect our 2018 operating income effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%, resulting in an expected increase in net operating income of approximately 17%.", "While the new tax rate will result in a lower GAAP tax expense, cash taxes paid will not show a similar reduction in the near or intermediate term. On a cash tax basis, the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by provisions of the new legislation that limit the tax deduction for policy reserves and acquisition costs. As such, we do not expect a significant increase in statutory earnings from the lower tax rates.", "In addition, the lower tax rate will have a negative impact on our insurance company statutory capital by reducing their deferred tax assets. Although we have not completed the statutory filings for our insurance subsidiaries, we expect the reduction in total statutory capital to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million as of December 31st, 2017.", "Thus, in short, the GAAP tax rate will decline by 12 to 13 basis points, but in the intermediate-term, cash taxes will only be slightly lower, and we may be required to infuse capital into our insurance subsidiaries over time, to make up for the lower deferred tax assets. In the coming months, we will evaluate further the short and long-term effects of the new tax legislation on our operations.", "Now, regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries. We currently plan to maintain our capital at the level necessary to return -- to retain our current ratings. For the past several years, that level has been around an NAIC RBC ratio of 325% on a consolidated basis.", "While our 2017 statutory financial statements are not finalized, we anticipate that our consolidated RBC ratio will be in the range of 300% to 310% of company action level RBC, reflecting roughly a 30 basis point reduction in the ratio as a result of the reduction in deferred tax assets previously discussed.", "Should the NAIC adjust the RBC factors in 2018, as is expected, to take into account the lower tax rate, we would expect a further reduction of approximately 45 basis points in our RBC ratio for the year end in December 31st, 2018.", "We are still in the early stages of determining the appropriate target RBC ratio for our insurance subsidiaries in 2018 in light of the tax legislation and we'll need to have discussions with our rating agencies and regulators on the topic. Should we choose to make additional capital contributions, we are confident that we can fund any required amounts without a significant impact on our excess cash flow.", "Next, a few comments to provide an update on our Direct Response operations. In the fourth quarter, we again saw growth in the Direct Response underwriting margin. The underwriting margin, as a percent of premium, was 18.4%, up from 15.1% in the year ago quarter. This reflects higher-than-normal policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to lower policy obligations in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "While the lower policy obligations were generally expected due to seasonality, the overall underwriting margin percentage for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our expectations.", "The underwriting margin percentage for the full year 2017 was 15.6%, toward the higher end of the range provided on previous calls. For 2018, we are estimating the underwriting margin percentage for Direct Response to be approximately the same as in 2017, in the 14.5% to 16.5% range. We also expect the underwriting margin percentage to be seasonally low in the first half of the year and then higher in the second half of the year.", "Finally, with respect to our earnings guidance for 2018, we are projecting the net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ended December 31st, 2018. The $6 per share midpoint of this guidance reflects a 24% increase over the 2017 earnings per share of $4.82.", "The increase is primarily attributable to the lower tax rate in 2018, offset by higher after-tax compensation expense due to the lower tax benefits. We now estimate that our stock compensation expense will be in the range of $18 million to $22 million as compared to approximately $5 million, absent tax reform.", "Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Larry.", "Larry Hutchison", "Thank you, Frank. Those are our comments. We will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "We'll go first to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi. I had a question, first on just the capital and cash flow. What are some of the actions that you're considering to replenish capital at the subs? And do you expect this to sort of affect share buybacks, especially if the rating agencies don't change their RBC thresholds?", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, Jimmy. At this point in time, yes, they really indicated, we still have some work to determine what we think are really the appropriate target RBC levels for the organization, given the changes in the tax rates. We have yet to have any real in-depth discussions with the rating agencies with respect to any anticipated levels.", "We do think, that to the extent that we do need to put in any additional capital to at least make up for the lower deferred tax assets that we can -- we're really taking a look at being able to do that through some type of a debt financing rather than through our excess cash flows, but that will have to be something we'll have to work through.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then on the Direct Response business, your margins improved. I think this is the third straight quarter that they improved and the magnitude of the improvement was higher this quarter than in the past few. Is that just because of the actions that you've been taken on limiting marketing and pricing? Or was there like an aberration or something else that helped the results this quarter?", "Gary Coleman", "Jimmy, I think, as far as the impact on the fourth quarter, it's more just the fact that we had -- the claims came in a little bit lower than we expected on the overall block. The changes that we're making in sales, we are seeing higher profit margins on new business sold, but the contribution to margin, new business in one -- in the first year is not that high. So, the increase in the fourth quarter really is more due to the lower claims.", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, part of that, Jimmy, is also, just the seasonality. We really didn't expect the policy obligation percentage in the fourth quarter to probably be around that 55%, maybe 56% range, came in around 54%. So, it was -- really, it's the low end of what our expectations where. But we were expecting improvement there in the fourth quarter.", "Now again, as we look to 2018, we've really -- we expect some high seasonal clients in the first half of the year, so we kind of expect that underwriting margin percentage to be a little lower in the first half and then come back up again in the second half of the year.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. And then just lastly, I don't know if you mentioned and I missed it, but what's the tax rate that you're embedding in your new EPS guidance?", "Frank Svoboda", "Between 19% and 20%.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good morning, Torchmark, and thank you for the extensive tax discussion. Believe it or not, I have one follow-up question on that. That is, I'm just trying to understand, help me on how the rating agencies and the regulators would look at an event that causes your GAAP earnings to go up, your GAAP equity to go up, you're -- over time, your GAAP taxes paid to go down, although not over the short to intermediate term. Why would you need more capital when all those events are happening? Are we assuming they just look at historic math formulas, or are they actually thinking intellectually about how these things interplay?", "Gary Coleman", "Bob, we had a lot of those same questions. And that's one thing we -- as Frank mentioned, we haven't talking -- talked to the rating agencies yet, but that's -- I think that would be a part of our discussion when we talk to -- Frank, do you have anything to--", "Frank Svoboda", "Yes, no. It's just kind of one of those funny anomalies of where the tax rate goes down, which should be good long-term benefit, but you have required additional capital. So, there's are some of the questions that we'll have to get answered.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "But you think there is a chance that logic would prevail, or you think the more likely scenario is that they blindly hold to their math calculations?", "Gary Coleman", "I think, Bob, for us, it's -- we don't have enough information to know. We -- again, we haven't have discussions with them, so we'll just have to wait and see.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "We'll go next to Ryan Krueger with KBW.", "Ryan Krueger", "Hi. I was hoping you can touch on how much that capacity you believe you have at this point. I know one thing that happened with tax reform was, you've got a meaningful uplift to GAAP book value. Can you talk a little about where you -- where the debt to cap could go, and how you are thinking about debt capacity?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. Our debt to cap ratio at the end of 2017 is going to be a little under 24%, and we really -- we're projecting that the ratio will go down below 23% by the end of 2018. We looked at that and just -- and if we were going to bring our debt to cap ratio back up to some of the level that we've had the last couple of years, which has been around 26%, we'd probably have around $300 million of capacity, just to keep it at that level.", "And then, if our discussion with the rating agencies, we usually have a higher kind of limit, if you will, with respect our debt to cap ratio before they would be too concerned about it, so that would give us some -- even additional capacity above that, if we think if we needed it.", "Ryan Krueger", "Got it. And you did not -- is it correct that you did not assume any debt issuance in your EPS guidance at this point for 2018?", "Larry Hutchison", "That is correct.", "Ryan Krueger", "Okay. And then last one was on the -- the free cash flow guidance for -- of $320 million to $330 million for 2018. It's obviously more based on the 2017 financials. If we roll it forward another year and taking into consideration changes in cash taxes, would you still expect a similar amount of free cash flow as 2018 and into 2019?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. With all thing else being equal, from a statutory earnings perspective, looking forward a year, we really anticipate probably between $5 million and $10 million of lower cash taxes, solely because of the tax reform.", "So, we think it could be a slight uptick from that perspective and then obviously there's several other items in there that could affect the cash flow going forward. But we would expect it to be at that level or starting to tick-up a little bit from there.", "Ryan Krueger", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Scott", "Good morning. Had a question on RBC. Just in light of, I guess, you guys having done a bit less of the XXX transactions and sort of statutory capital optimization and I know, the NICs, I guess looking at a wide range of options, with a group capital calculation.", "If one of those things I think is sort of applying PBR to kind of level the playing field between those that have used XXX and AXXX and those that haven't. If you apply that sort of methodology, how much of a benefit would that be for you guys, just in thinking about like, surplus or how much of your reserves would decline if you use PBR?", "Just like, rough, rough numbers? I just want to get a feel for if something like that was occurring, would that just totally alleviate any kind of issues you had around, like in RBC, like optically declining around tax rates -- or tax reform?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes. The PBR that's come out, it's really more focused on some of the aggressive term insurance and the UL products and secondary guarantees. Products that we don't write. So, we have a few blocks of business where PBR will come into effect, but it is pretty minimal.", "And at this point in time, we really don't anticipate that PBR will have much -- any real material impact on the amount of our statutory reserves.", "Alex Scott", "Okay. And I guess, second question, just on the guide for 2018. The updated guide versus the guide you provided previously. I mean, there, could you highlight just if there are any other sort of adjustments, moving parts in there other than just the tax rate? And how to think about those?", "Larry Hutchison", "Sure. Really, from the previous guidance, we really saw a little bit better experience on the health lines, so we are kind of following that into 2018. So, we are expecting a little bit, I think that overall, the margins to be -- for the overall, on health side, to be pretty similar to where they are in 2017. That was actually a little bit of an improvement from what we had anticipated back in October. So, the experience that we saw in the fourth quarter kind of helped us with that.", "But then that uptick, maybe offset a little bit, due to some higher administrative expenses. We're looking -- our pension expense is going to be going up a little bit again in 2018, so that will be a little bit of a headwind.", "Short-term interest rates, affecting our short-term debt, those costs, that will have a bit of our higher interest expense as well and then of course, for some of the higher share price, a little bit of a drag with respect to the impact of the buyback program.", "And then we really look at the option expense. And I think one of the items that really looked at is, while the increase in the -- or the decrease in overall tax rates gave us about $1 of additional earnings per share from just a change in the rate.", "The excess tax benefits that we've had, that's an offset against our stock option expense. Of course, we have, with respect to the stock option expense, you have a lower tax benefit, plus we have lower excess tax benefits. So, that's what's kind of helping to -- or causing that decline of the overall impact at the tax benefit -- of the tax rate.", "Alex Scott", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. ", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Hi. I wanted to follow-up on the tax rate. Is the primary reason for the tax rate being lower than on the statutory rate of 21%, just tax preferred investments, like Build America Bonds or is there something else as well?", "Frank Svoboda", "It's primarily low-income housing tax credit investments that we've made over the years.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay, and how should we think about the duration of those? Is that something that comes into play in your tax rate over the next two to three years? Or are they longer duration, so you shouldn't expect much of a change in the 2019 to 2020?", "Larry Hutchison", "Yes, a longer duration of those, we continue to build the portfolio over the years. They generally receive credits over 10 years. 10 to 12 years, is -- there's a little bit of a grayed-in period. So, there's still several years out, with respect to those benefits.", "Jimmy Bhullar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions.", "Mike Majors", "All right, thank you for joining us this morning. Those are our comments, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.
