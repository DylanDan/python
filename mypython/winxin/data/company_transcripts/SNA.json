Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss. Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "[audiogap] (00:26 \u2013 00:39)", "and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our Q3 earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and of our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. After that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "The Snap-on fourth quarter, sales increases and broad profit gains marking another period of encouraging performance; again this quarter we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds.", "Overall sales in the quarter were $889.8 million, 4.5% higher than last year. That total included acquisition related volume from Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont and it also included the impact of $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Our organic growth in the quarter was 3.6% with gains registered across every group. EPS, it was $2.47, up 11.3% from the $2.22 registered in 2015.", "Our OpCo operating margin reached 19.8%, an increase of 70 basis points and those profits include $3.7 million of adverse foreign currency. Financial services earnings of 51.6% (sic) [$51.6 million] (3:27) were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin including both financial services and OpCo of 23.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points in the quarter. And our markets, well the Automotive Repair segment continues to remain favorable, changing technology, the aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group \u2013 progress in all geographies, gains throughout the franchise network and the repair systems and information, our RS&I Group, advancements across our businesses serving repair shops, owners and managers. All of them.", "Taken together these businesses confirm the ongoing strength of the repair market, and clearly demonstrate the opportunity available. Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I, the markets were mixed but overall positive. There were of course headwinds and some still recovering industrial sectors and a few macro-economically challenged geographies but in total, progress was across that group.", "U.S. military sales were robust. Budgets restraints loosened, and we are on point to take advantage. And we're ready to act in the future as further opportunities arise in that area. C&I's also the most international of our businesses. And in the period, our overall activity in the regions outside the U.S. increased, overcoming the economic turbulence that exists in Europe, the Middle East, and in some parts of Asia. So across the corporation, I would characterize our environment as mixed but positive, with ongoing strength in automotive repair and some improvement in the afflicted critical industries and the challenged geographies. And we remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending in critical industries, and building in emerging markets.", "In looking ahead, we also see clear runways for further improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement in RCI is continuing to drive significant advantages. Our fourth quarter and our full year results clearly confirm that progress. And our new acquisitions, they provide more opportunity to apply those processes and create value.", "Now for the full year, sales were $3.43 billion, an as reported increase of 2.3%. The organic volume gain was 2.9%, with the Tools Group up 5.6%, RS&I rising 4.7%, and C&I slightly ahead of last year. Our EPS in 2016 was $9.20, an increase of 13.6%. And driving those earnings was an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $198.7 million, which rose $28.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23%, up 170 basis points. Results achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities on our runways for growth, and by driving down our runways for improvement.", "Now let's move to the groups in our fourth quarter. In C&I, sales increased 1.6% from 2015, impacted by $6.2 million of unfavorable currency and helped by $4.2 million in acquisition related volume. Organic sales were up 2.4%, the second straight quarter of increases for C&I but with varied results across the group including gains by SNA Europe and by industrial, and decreases in the power tools and in places like India and Indonesia. C&I operating income was $43.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 15.3%, a rise of 40 basis points. That's our second quarter of 15%s.", "Encouragingly SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up high single-digits, continuing its progress. Now 13 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth. And the profit climb for SNA Europe was even steeper, now up 15 straight quarters. Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products, and improved new processes creating those extended trends in some what I would call fairly challenging geographies.", "Also in C&I our Industrial division moved forward. As I mentioned before, on strong U.S. military sales, and also an array of new products. New products like \u2013 innovations like our radiator cap removal for the railroad sector, a specially designed offering used on locomotive or engine radiator caps replacing field cobble sockets, which were prone to early failure. The Snap-on solution incorporates deep machine grooves which provides the ample engagement and the strength necessary to remove what you might imagine are those very stubborn railroad caps. The new adapter can be paired with a standard ratchet, eliminating the need for the previously used long T-handled tool and therefore requiring less clearance to perform the task, making the job easier in those tight engine quarters. Another productivity solution born from a long list of customer connection made every day, this one for the rail industry.", "And for the Aviation segment, our Industrial division launched the Versatorq 2, torque data acquisition system, designed to verify and record torque ratings in tight and even hazardous environments. Places like aircraft fuel lines, the Versatorq 2 allows easy torque measurement deep inside air frames, where access is difficult and it includes an explosive-proof electronics making it safe, even in combustible environments. This unique Snap-on offering enables the technicians to record critical information, storing and recalling up to 3,500 torque readings. And the product is UL compliant for safety, and ATECH certified for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. And based on that, we believe we have a clear winner in the Versatorq.", "Our Power Tools division recorded lower sales in the quarter, as I said. That said, it did launch some promising new product. Product like our CTR714, a 14.4 volt quarter-inch drive cordless ratchet. It was launched in December so it didn't drive the quarter, but it has a great future. This latest tool in the Snap-on cordless family includes a tapered head designed for better accessibility, 35 foot pounds of torque output, perfect for applications with fasteners 10 millimeters or smaller that are delicate and difficult, a variable speed trigger for that all important control with those small fasteners, a built-in LED light to illuminate any work area, and new drive materials for increased strength, size, power and durability. Terrific for small fasteners in tight spaces, because of that, because of the size, power and durability and the applicability to tight spaces for small fasteners, we believe we have another best-in-class product with our cordless ratchet. Well, that's C&I.", "Now on to the Tools Group. A 3% rise in organic sales. Operating earnings of $73.5 million; a margin rate of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, a gain which includes 70 basis points impact from negative currency. So overcoming that fairly significant negative currency hit.", "Now, the volume growth in the Tools Group was not what we've seen in recent periods. The full year average for the group is 5.6%. But importantly, based on what we see in the shops, and what we hear from our franchisees, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall auto repair market. It's still robust, and offers abundant opportunity and we don't believe there's been any change in the positive trajectory of the Tools Group growing strength. We often speak of our Snap-on's runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales opportunities. At the top of the list is enhancing the franchise channel, and we believe we're positioned to continue that positive trajectory.", "Throughout the year and even in the recent quarter, the Tools Group demonstrated significant progress along that runway, financials trending positively, the franchisee health metrics consistently gaining, both clearly representing a strengthening vehicle repair center, and an improved proposition for our franchisees.", "Beyond the numbers, there's a great deal of optimism throughout the network. You can see if you talk to these people. The franchisees attending our 2017 kick-off events held early last month all over the country, display a great deal of enthusiasm about the vehicle repair sector in general, and about their individual businesses in particular. I participated in the kick-off and I believe the level of excitement and confidence surrounding the van channel is stronger than ever. And our optimism was acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.", "Again this year, Snap-on was ranked among the top 50 in Entrepreneur's magazine's list of top 500 franchises, finishing number one in the professional tools and equipment category, and the Franchise Business Review which collects franchisee feedback, satisfaction feedback, franchisee satisfaction feedback listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the tenth consecutive year we've received that reward.", "Finally, and my favorite, the Military Times included Snap-on in its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five, and representing the only mobile tool franchise on the list. Now this type of recognition would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product, many developed from insights from our customers, guided by Snap-on customer connection and invested with Snap-on technical insight and innovation. And in 2016, for the seventh straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products. Those million dollar sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field.", "Take for instance the ATECH 300 electronic torque wrench. Launched in the fourth quarter, this latest torque offering solves an important customer problem. Many light vehicles today, pickups and SUVs, now use fasteners requiring between 250 foot pounds and 300 foot pounds of torque, and specifications for accurate measurements of those higher torques are increasing in number.", "The Snap-on ATECH 300 is the first light vehicle half-inch electronic torque wrench to rate at 300 foot pounds. It's lighter, more accurate, and it eliminates the need to add heavy duty tools just to accommodate the new pickup and SUV torque requirements. Designed and manufactured in our City of Industry facility in California, the ATECH 300 incorporates the same great features as our other ATECH models-a reduced profile for better accessibility, a longer handle for easily applying the extra torque, power interruption technology to prevent power resets and protect the data, and a large LCD screen for greater visibility. Franchisee feedback? Well, we launched it late in the year and it's selling out.", "We said, I think in many forms including this one that there's growing opportunity in vehicle precision, in torque measurement. As vehicles become more automatic, there's more need for more precision. Even in the fourth quarter we saw confirmation in that trend. Our torque line grew nicely; it's one of the reasons why we acquired the torque skills of Sturtevant Richmont and we expect good things going forward in that growing product line.", "Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $319.8 million with an organic rise of 8.9%, significant gains in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit rise of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $82.5 million increased $10.4 million to 25.8% of sales, up 10 basis points, overwhelming, overcoming the impact of the newly acquired operations.", "RS&I expanded across the repair shop owner and manager sector, across the full sector, but particularly with independents. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses recorded double-digit volume growth with those important customers. Our Mitchell 1 operations offers independent shops leading facility management software, innovative marketing services, and the most comprehensive repair information anywhere.", "Using the Snap-on Value Creation principles of customer connection and innovation, our Mitchell 1 team utilizes thousands of customer contacts every year, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the speed to solution of its pro-demand product, and expanding the literally hundreds of millions of actual repair events in its unique sure-track big database, and in the fourth quarter the RS&I results clearly show the effect of the Mitchell 1 progress.", "Now for our diagnostics division, another encouraging quarter, led by ongoing success of recent product launches. We mentioned a couple of these in the third quarter: the MODIS Edge, handheld scanner, very sophisticated handheld scanner, and our thermal imager. A whole new category of vehicle diagnostics will both continue to exceed expectations, and both drove the diagnostic division to strong double-digit gains.", "RS&I also advanced its work station product line in the quarter, introducing the new EPIQ diagnostic work station. The EPIQ work station combines two of Snap-on's top of the line products, matching our sophisticated VERUS handheld with our EPIQ tool storage box into one custom platform. This enhanced work station is targeted for shops desiring capability. This combo will address the most challenging repairs. Convenience, everything a technician needs is right at hand. And confidence: the visible presence of the work station tells the customer that this shop is serious and sophisticated and able to tackle the most difficult of repairs. Work station sales are up nearly 40% year-over-year, and the new EPIQ combo is part of that success.", "The RS&I Group also includes progress with OEM dealerships. Over the years Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS, has developed an extraordinary level of insight and capability in developing and running electronic parts catalogs for dealerships. And their skills paid off in the quarter. As SBS captured the contract to provide a state of the art EPC for another major vehicle OEM, another win, and more growth for Snap-on in the OEM space.", "Finally in the period, the RS&I equipment division registered a low single-digit organic increase with mixed results across our North American and International Undercar operations. That said, we keep driving to expand our position with repair shops, with new products to sell and with strategic and coherent acquisitions.", "And in the fourth quarter, RS&I made an important addition to the equipment division with the acquisition of Car-O-Liner. The Car-O-Liner business brings greater capabilities in collision repair and strengthens our overall position in the heavy-duty segment. Given the trends in the collision space, the higher emphasis on shop efficiency and the power of matching Car-O-Liner with our other RS&I divisions, we believe this acquisition will create even more opportunities to expand with repair shop owners and managers going forward. We're excited.", "Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales growing 3.6%; EPS $2.47 in the quarter, up 13.6%. Progress along each of our runways for coherent growth, progress along those runways for coherent growth and acquisitions that will give us more to sell and make those runways even wider, and clear advancements down our runways for improvements, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement driving a 19.8% operating margin, 70 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $889.8 million in the quarter increased $38.1 million, or 4.5% from 2015 levels, reflecting a $30 million, or 3.6% organic sales gain, $23.3 million of acquisition related sales, and $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 190 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector, as well as its sales improvements in our Commercial & Industrial segment.", "Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% improved 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to sales leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $267.8 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.1% in the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points, primarily due to higher acquisition related and other expenses including operating expenses for Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter, as well as a 30 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $176.1 million, including $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 8.5% and as a percentage of sales, improved 70 basis points to 19.8%.", "Financial services revenue of $74.2 million in the quarter increased 17.6% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $51.6 million, including $0.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 14.7%.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $227.7 million, including $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.8%, and the operating margin of 23.6% improved 90 basis points from 22.7% a year ago.", "Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 30.8% compared to 31.1% last year. For the full year, our 2016 effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 31.7% last year.", "Finally, fourth quarter net earnings of $146.3 million, or $2.47 per diluted share increased $14.9 million, or $0.25 per share from 2015 levels, representing an 11.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, earnings per diluted share of $9.20 increased 13.6% as compared to $8.10 in 2015.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $286.3 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.5 million, or 1.6%, reflecting a $6.5 million, or 2.4% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of acquisition-related sales, and $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The $6.5 million organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business, and a low single-digit increase to customers in critical industries, largely as a result of higher sales to the military.", "During the quarter, our European-based hand tools business benefited from broad-based sales growth with particular strength in countries including Sweden, Spain, and France. These organic sales gains were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in the segment's power tools operations and lower sales in certain emerging markets.", "Gross profit in the C&I Group of $115.4 million compared to $107.6 million last year. The gross margin of 40.3% improved 210 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, and 100 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $71.5 million in the quarter compared to $65.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 170 basis points primarily as a result of higher cost, including operating expenses for new acquisitions, 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a 70 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.9 million including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $2 million from 2015 levels, and the operating margin of 15.3% improved 40 basis points.", "Turning now to slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $417.5 million increased $6.3 million, or 1.5%, reflecting a $12.2 million, or 3% organic sales gain and $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. $12.2 million organic sales increase includes a low single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations, and a mid single-digit gain in the company's International franchise operations.", "Gross profit of $175.5 million compared to $173.7 million last year. Gross margin of 42% declined 20 basis points, as 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from higher sales.", "Operating expenses of $102 million in the quarter were essentially flat compared to last year. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 30 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $73.5 million including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $1.6 million, and the operating margin of 17.6% improved 10 basis points.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide 9.

Operating earnings from financial services of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million compared to operating earnings of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million last year. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses of 1.3% in the quarter compared with 1.2% last year.", "The average yield on finance receivables of 18.2% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $260.3 million in the quarter increased 3.3% from prior year levels.", "Moving to slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operations. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $224 million, or 14.1%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations, including a seasonal rise in delinquencies.", "In this fourth quarter, we experienced a slightly higher seasonal increase in delinquencies and the allowance was increased accordingly. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 14.7% in the quarter, reflecting both continued growth of the overall portfolio and higher average yields on finance receivables.", "Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $151.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from comparable 2015 levels as higher net earnings were partially offset by net changes in operating asset and liabilities, including $20 million of discretionary U.S. pension contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $229.3 million included $160.4 million for the combined acquisitions of Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, $53.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables, and $17.7 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $74.3 million.", "Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting higher sales, $21.5 million of receivables related to acquisitions and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at 2015 year-end to 63 days at 2016 year-end partially offset by $13.8 million of foreign currency translation. Excluding acquisitions, days sales outstanding was 61 days.", "Inventories increased $32.7 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and $21.5 million of inventories related to acquisitions, partially offset by $17.8 million of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Excluding acquisitions, inventory turns were 3.4.", "Our year-end cash position of $77.6 million decreased $15.2 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net decrease reflects the funding of $915 million of new finance receivables, acquisitions of $160.4 million, dividend payments of $147.5 million, the repurchase of 758,000 shares for $120.4 million, and $74.3 million for capital expenditures. These cash decreases were largely offset by $671.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables, $567.3 million of cash from operations and $134.2 million of proceeds from a net increase in notes payable and other short-term borrowings.", "Our net debt to capital ratio of 26.3% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.", "In addition to our $77.6 million of cash, and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets.", "As of 2016 year-end we had $130 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Since year-end, on January 17 we repaid $150 million of 5.5% senior notes at maturity with available cash and commercial paper.", "That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2017. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2016 full-year rate of 31%. This assumes no major changes in existing U.S. federal regulations \u2013 tax regulations. Should there be definitive legislation on corporate tax reform, we will assess the effects of such at that time.", "With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, you heard about our year and our fourth quarter. I believe they represent continuing confirmation of the opportunities along our runways for growth and testimony to the possibilities inherent in Snap-On value creation and our runways for improvement. C&I growing again in a very turbulent environment, finding the opportunities where they exist in critical industries, continuing the upward trend in Europe in difficult and uncertain economies, reaching an OI margin of 15.3%, one of its highest, up 40 basis points.", "The Tools Group growing, not equal to recent periods, but still displaying the hallmarks of continuing achievement: a robust vehicle repair sector, positive franchisee health, strong product introductions, and a continuing enthusiasm across the franchisees and the customers. And through it all, profit growth, OI margin of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, despite a 70 basis-point headwind from unfavorable currency.", "And RS&I, 8.9% organic growth, confirming the strength of vehicle repair, progress with independent shops and dealerships, exciting new products spearheading those advancements, and OI margins reaching 25.8%, up despite the impact of Car-O-Liner and its lower profit levels.", "And the acquisitions, Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont adding more product fuel for growth and providing more opportunity for improvement. It all came together to bring our OpCo operating margin to 19.8%, up 70 basis points. And when you add Financial Services, the overall operating margin was 23.6%, up 90 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter and an encouraging year. And we believe we have the market and the position and the team to continue the trend of extended positive performance through 2017 and beyond.", "Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know, again, many of you are listening. The progress accomplished is a direct reflection of the capability and perseverance you contribute to our effort. For your achievements in the quarter and the year, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Good morning, guys. It's David Kelley on for Bret this morning. Just a couple quick questions. And first on RS&I, strong organic growth in the quarter, Just want to drill down on the double-digit diagnostics growth you pointed out. Was there something specific to the quarter that drove the robust performance there, given some of the cadence of....", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yes, there was.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Go ahead.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yes, there was, there was. Look, the thing is, as we said, we launched two dynamite new products and actually the thermal imager for us is a whole new category of diagnosing a vehicle, not data driven but physically driven by looking at a vehicle. Like, for example, if you're looking for a bad cylinder, it's tough to tell from the electronic diagnostics, but you can tell if you focus the thermal imager on it and see which one is hot. That changed everything. That created a lot of volume in that situation, a lot of attention for diagnostics. And then the MODIS Edge was another extension of our already pretty robust line, but a pretty good tool. So those two really drove the business into that 8.9%.", "Then you had the Mitchell 1 had its usual strong performance in terms of selling to shops. And then we had some comeback with dealerships, which can be lumpy. The lumpy side can be dealerships. But mostly, the story is new product.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Great. No, appreciate the color. And I guess given the favorable secular tailwind that should benefit that sector, how do we think about maybe longer-term organic growth opportunity in RS&I looking out over the next two to three years?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, we always say, look, it's 4% to 6%. That's what we're targeting in most environments. We expect RS&I to be in the middle of that, and the RS&I numbers in the last three years are 4.9%, 4.9%, 4.7%. But this particular one with these new products we feel pretty positive.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then one more from me and I'll pass it along. Just on the Tools growth, I was wondering if maybe you'd be able to give us a feel for cadence in the quarter. I was wondering if there was any pickup late in December or any uptick you've even seen in January year-to-date that's contributing to that confidence in a rebound in 2017 here.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No. Look, okay, the Tools Group was not equal to its normal trend, but 3% isn't a poke in the eye with a stick in a 1.9% economy. So we still feel okay about that. But you could have reasonably expected more. But everything we look at, the enthusiasm of the market, the strength of our product, our franchisees, how they react, we feel pretty positive about that. So what I'm saying is, is that you look at those numbers and you may say, below trend but in anything you look at from a physical point of view or for a conversational point of view or seeing a product pipeline point of view, you feel confident.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, great. Again, appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Leiker from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Morning.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Morning.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Guys, just as a follow-up on that last question on the Tools side, is there anything \u2013 obviously, that number is a lot weaker than what we've been seeing here for actually quite a while. Is there anything from a timing perspective or regional perspective or anything as you dig down inside there that could give us a little bit more color?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, I don't think so. The timing is not really \u2013 we have up weeks and down weeks. It's hard to make any interpretation in that, David. I think simply stated, I hate to use an analogy like this, but sometimes your clean-up hitter hits a single and a double and doesn't hit a homerun and you still win the game, and that's the way we see this quarter. I wouldn't use the word weaker 3%. I hate to use that word because I think it's a reasonable growth, but yeah, it is below trend and we are unsatisfied with that number.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I know you don't talk about numbers on a go-forward basis, but can you give us any sense of what our proper expectation should get zeroed in on as we look at 2017 for that business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, we always say our growth is going to be in the 4% to 6% range, and that's the kind of thing we think of. And Tools Group grew at 5.6% in the last quarter \u2013 I mean last year, sorry, last year. And so I don't think we see anything to interrupt our trajectory, let's put it that way.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then the second item here is on the credit company. When you dig down into the credit stats, some of them at the margin are getting a little bit weaker I guess. The losses are up, the delinquencies, there's some seasonality there. The originations growth, which I'm sure is tied into the Tools number. But can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there? Your allowances you said you took up a little bit, but it looks like the losses are a little bit. Is this something that's just an adjustment, or do you think this is a start of a trend?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, I'll speak to the originations. Look, originations is in the Tools Group (44:02), it follows the Tools Group. And fundamentally in the quarter what you see is high growth in the diagnostics area. The diagnostics products were the hottest, in particular the thermal imager, which tends to be at the bottom end of the diagnostics range, we would still classify it as big ticket. But the origination, the credit penetration in that area of diagnostics tends to be lower. So you fundamentally look at the characteristics of the diagnostic sales and we shake our head and say, yes, lower administration, makes a lot of sense based on what we sold in the Tools Group.", "And so that's kind of our view in that \u2013 and It's perfectly explainable in those kinds of situations and seeing what happens with the Tools Group. It's a lot less change next quarter because of the characteristics of what sells and what new products come out. In terms of the reserves, I'll let Aldo talk about that.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, David, if you look at the cash flow statement, you'll see that our provision, if you look year-over-year, it's up about $4.4 million, just to give you a little color on that. If you just still look at what I would call the normal sized growth in the portfolio, that would account for about a third of the provision. So you have, yes, two-thirds of extra growth in the provision relates to the delinquency and characteristics of the trends. So at the end of the quarter, we think the reserve's adjusted accordingly. It reflects that. And as we move forward, we're not alarmed by any of the statistics. These are within the range of deviation that we've seen over recent times, so we're comfortable.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I got a few emails this morning. There are some who are saying that that's a sign that the end market, that your customer is weakening, and that the credit company is the canary in the coal mine.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, we don't see the end market weakening, actually. That was the whole point of half of my script here. I don't think we see that to the extent that anything we see \u2013 I was just on a van the other day, two days ago, and it didn't seem that way. I was in the garages and those guys seemed pretty robust in their view of the world, talking about how they've had to turn away business, in fact. I know this is a windshield survey, but in terms of the kickoffs were three weeks ago. And we all go out all over the country and everybody came back saying, our guys are more pumped than ever before. So we don't see that, anyway. We don't see the end-market weakening at all.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question, Aldo, on the acquisitions. It looks like the revenue contribution there was more than just what you would think given the calendar and the timing of the acquisitions. Is there some seasonality in there that skewed that contribution?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "There is a bit. If you look at the collision business itself, the fourth quarter tends to be one of their better quarters. We owned Car-O-Liner practically speaking for a full two months, Sturtevant Richmont to a lesser extent was really only about a little over about five-, six-week ownership period. But yes, the collision business does skew a bit to the fourth quarter.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. And thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor at Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the Tools segment. Can you just talk a little bit about the growth you saw in big ticket versus smaller ticket business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I think ticket was up, but it was \u2013 when we say that big ticket you can classify it into three pieces or three general pieces, David. You've got the tool storage boxes, right. They're the biggest of the big ticket, and almost all of them get financed. And then you've got diagnostics that goes through a range. And then you have some other dribs and drabs, like we'll sell welders and things like that, but that is not a big ticket item. Big ticket grew faster in Tools Group, but the lion's share of that growth was in the diagnostic product, the MODIS Edges, which are expensive, and they are \u2013 maybe list price is probably $6,000, $5,999, something like that. And then you've got the thermal imager, which was at the bottom of the range. The list price is somewhere I think around $1,300, $1,400. So the thing is, is that you've got a lower end at that level.", "So your big ticket was greater than the Tools Group, but more anchored in the lower end of big ticket than in maybe the quarters we've been used to lately. Tool storage was slightly off this quarter. So the tool storage representation was not as strong in this. So thus the smaller originations than it used to because thermal imagers, the penetration, the need for financing is a lot lower than for tool storage box.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "You're talking about stronger diagnostics. I realize in response to an earlier question you said timing wasn't an issue here, but I know you ran a storage promotion in late third quarter. Is it possible you just pulled forward some storage out of 4Q into 3Q, and that's accounting for the slower growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, maybe. There's a lot of things. I think \u2013 I don't know. Fundamentally these kinds of things are fairly judgmental in that situation (49:23). That's certainly a possibility, although we don't think \u2013 we try not to pull ahead those kinds of things, but certainly launches of new products really affect this kind of thing. And remember that you're talking about difference between 3% growth and 6% growth in the Tools Group, you're talking about one set of sockets once a week for every franchisee. So it's a difficult thing to \u2013 when you're talking about those differences, it's a difficult thing to pin down exactly the results. I would say if you're talking about tool storage, the biggest effect was hot diagnostics taking a lot of attention.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Same question. Just your net income margin continues to grow. You're now up to pretty impressive 16%. Just given the operating leverage in the business, is there an upside to this number in 2017 when materials' costs are going to be re-inflating and maybe big ticket growth in Tools may be slowing?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah. There is. I mean I think we say that we keep driving up the margin, there's a lot of reasons for this. I mean fundamentally we see a lot of opportunities even today for improvement in Snap-On in every division, that's number one. Number two is, yes, material prices are rising, but we don't buy that much and you've never heard me explain on this call variance associated with material costs and we've made a couple of acquisitions now that gives us more grist for the Snap-On value creation mill.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "So I see lots of opportunities there still. So I don't think, by no means have we hit the top anywhere.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Last question for me. Just on the balance sheet. You ended another year with roughly 1 times net debt-to-EBITDA. You're doing bolt-on transactions, you've obviously been successful in augmenting growth. But just given the strength of your free cash flow, is the capacity here to continue to bolt-ons and grow the dividend while also accelerating your share repurchase activity?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah, Dave, it's Aldo. Our principal focus for free cash flow is to look for investment opportunities whether that be organic or by way of acquisitions, that is what we look to. And, again, our strategy along share repurchase is still more or less to offset dilution. And, again, we continue to make contributions into our pension plan. So as we go forward and things change, we'll reexamine those on a quarterly basis, but that's kind of the pecking order right now.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. A lot of the questions relating to the Tools Group have been answered, but, Nick, I mean, with the Rock 'N Roll Express vans, which I understand are the ones that are selling these big ticket storage items, have you been increasing that on an absolute basis? Or year-over-year is it pretty steady in terms of the units that are out there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Bingo! It was flat, but we increased the Techno-Vans, which sells diagnostics. We moved those up 10% in the quarter, 20% year-over-year. So that's a relevant question. I didn't add that before, but that's one of the things that helped drive the diagnostics business. It all come together, new product and more power in the field's marketing of all this. Now, as I've said in the past, I'm not so sure that has an effect, and the fact that we didn't increase Rock 'N Roll vans doesn't necessarily have an effect because we think we get better every quarter at using them, but the fact is we haven't increased them for some time.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. So that helps. And then the other thing you mentioned in your commentary that it was a record number of hit products this year, which I assume a hit product is one that generates over a million of sales.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Exactly.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of that growth on a percentage basis, or just the absolute number of hit products...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I'll just say, I don't like to talk about the absolute number because I don't want to get pinned to the cross of reporting on hit products every year. But I'll just tell you this, versus 10 years ago we've reached more than 6 times.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "And we keep growing on a regular basis.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Could you maybe talk about currency, I know that heading into the back part of the year, before Brexit we were hoping that we'd get some bouncing out or some flattening of currency, but with the sterling falling off the way that it did certainly it started to hurt. But we've seen the pound actually rebound somewhat. Can you maybe just give us an idea of what your reset expectations are for 2017 for when we could start to see a bottom with impact from currency?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Just to ground ourselves, in the fourth quarter we took about a $15 million hit in revenue from currency and about $0.05 or $4 million on the bottom line in currency. And for the full year we had about $50 million, just north of $50 million, $51.5 million and $0.26 or $23 million in currency.", "Looking forward, this is the darndest thing; at the end of the year we would have said same stuff. It would have been the same numbers, right. When we looked at it we figured we're going to see more or less the same currency effect that we had last year. You kind of rolled it out maybe a little different in conversation. But since the year-end things have changed, and we think the currency number's kind of half, for ballpark numbers you can kind of look at a half type currency. Look, maybe a little bit more than that early, right now if rates stay right where they are today we think it ends up being about half.", "And the interesting thing about this is we talked about delinquencies and provisions in the credit company. The effect of currency, the $23 million, is humongous compared to our noise around that. And of course currencies can always change, so tomorrow I may wake up and this may all be different. But if you took them today, we'd expect some relief. And that relief would be big, would be nice.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Got it. And going over to RS&I, you broke out some of the categories. I missed the growth for the independent shop owners. Could you give that number again?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Oh, we're saying double-digit growth for the independent shop owners. The repairs, the diagnostics and software for the independent repair shop owners, Mitchell 1 sells the software in terms of SureTrack with the hundreds of millions of dollars of records of repair. And then diagnostics is the hardware and software-based sale, things like a thermal imager or a handheld diagnostic that will decode everything a car wants to say. So if you take that together it's like double-digits.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Right. And just last question, you talked about the undercar equipment business being, I think, you said low single-digits. Could you just maybe flesh that out? Whether weather-related products for the wheel, tire aligners, wheel aligners and (56:42)...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I don't know. I hear all that, but I'm not sure I believe it. The thing is that every time I go in a garage sometimes the guys will tell me the weather has shafted us, and other people will say, the snow will make it bad for us because people can't get in. Other people will say the snow makes it good because they have a lot more procedures. So I'm not so sure how to play with that. What I will tell you about this is the Europeans tend to follow this. And the European business was much more sluggish compared to the North American business in this particular area. And Eastern Europe hasn't been too good to us in the equipment business either.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Got it. That's all I have. Thanks again.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Thank you, and good morning, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Good morning, Liam.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Nick, on C&I you've invested a fair amount in emerging markets. Are you seeing any meaningful move there to help absorb some of that upfront investment?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No. I wish I could say that I was, but the problem is, it seems like when we take one step forward, we take a step backwards in another place. For example, we're up in China this year, India difficult. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the demonetization in India and people ran out of cash. And a lot of our smaller distributors do a cash business, so our business went \u2013 kind of weakened in the third quarter.", "So we're seeing that kind of balance. The turbulence has bedeviled us lately in terms of Indonesia being down and Thailand being up. So we see progress from a physical point of view, I feel better about the business, but we haven't been able to monetize it yet. I'm confident we will, but it hasn't been a meaningful contributor to us.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. In terms of RCI...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "It will be though. It will be.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I'm just saying, I'm confident it will be. But it hasn't been yet because we're managing over all those differences.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And on RCI, you talk about, obviously, the internal processes. You've moved that out to the van channel, Rock 'N Roll Van and \u2013 are some of the examples. Do you have any RCI programs pushed out to the van channel beyond the company-owned vans?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, yeah. I mean the thing is, is that a couple of things. Of course, increasingly the franchisees are deciding on their own to add assistants. Now we have about 20% of them up with assistants; I think there's 695 or something like that, up about 20% year-over-year. And that gives them more \u2013 in effect adds time to each van. And what we've done is, we've put programs in place to support them: new computer systems, tablets that allow them to have two people wandering around a garage or separated off the van and can still have a cash register in their hand. And so that's been a kind of positive event. That's one thing I can think of for sure.", "And then, of course, just this quarter we expanded the Techno-Vans, another 10% growth quarter-over-quarter, 20% year-over-year. And that saves time because it puts an expert at the beck and call of a franchisee for a short period of time, and it also gives him and expands his selling space. So the Techno-Vans both amplify the time and allow him to time share more space for selling.", "So you have those two things going on. There's a number of smaller things which we focus on in terms of how they're going to manage their inventory, how they're going to do other things.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Richard Hilgert at the Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks, Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask about future technologies in the industry. We're hearing more and more about hybrids coming sooner, battery electrics coming sooner, and obviously some of these things are already out there today, along with autonomous features of vehicles. Are you already developing tools for some of these areas, and if so, what are some of the areas that you're already seeing coming through for new tooling and electronics diagnostics?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure. I mean we are developing, actually remember: change is our friend. It requires the mechanic to change his tool set and to get new implements to allow him to repair these cars. And make no mistake about it, they need repair. And so we are working on this but just to be clear, unfortunately for us, it ain't happening next Thursday. There are 300 million vehicles on the road in North America and a very micro-percentage of them are really hybrids and electronic, even today.", "But we are doing new things. For example, hybrids and electronics, we have a whole line of insulating tools. If you're poking around inside those engine compartments whether they are electric or hybrid, there's a lot of voltage in there, you don't want to get fried. And in fact there's a lot of danger. So a whole set of tools has to be used to particularly do that and we have them available.", "In terms of automated cars, that's what I was talking about in terms of torque. Any time a car becomes more reliant on a system, it requires more calibration, more precise adjustment. And torque is one of the things that's more important. Of course, there's a whole bunch of other things like alignment and tire balancing, and a number of things that emanate from precision that opens up a whole new range of opportunities for us. So as cars become more automatic, we're investing in torque. You heard me talk about the AT300. Because of the need for that precision, that's why the SUVs and light trucks are requiring this precise torques of such large numbers. They didn't used to do that.", "And in terms of things like lane departure systems or self-parks or adjusting automated cruise control, they all need more of this and that means precision. That's why we're buying in the torque sector because we believe this is a natural emanation of it. And one of the bright spots of the Tools Group in the fourth quarter was torque was up substantially, verifying that, confirming that view of the world.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Great. My other question, it deals with some of the questions that I'm getting from investors with respect to the finance operations. Aldo, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the credit policy there and how it works. Some of the pushback I get is that there's concern that the franchisees are given too much credit authority, and that collecting it back might be more difficult for them. Is there any kind of comments you can make about the credit policy standards right now? And the fact that the business isn't necessarily growing because policies are getting weak, it's just a matter of the business and its natural growth rates?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah, Richard. I think that last word is a good one. The business policy of sorts is to rely heavily on our experience. And when I say our experience that also includes the experience curve of the franchisees themselves. We have a traditional database that you get reports from various agencies and credit bureaus and things of that nature. We have our own internal history, which means a lot, and we keep that as a reservoir of information at the credit company. And we actually stripe and monitor the progress that our franchisees make along their path through a career in this business and track trends, and are able to instill in them some training.", "We provide training when we go to the periodic conferences. But they are in a position to meet their customers up close and personal each and every week for the most part, and offer back to the credit company, an informed credit decision that might not be apparent in the bureaus or in the database, such as, what's the peer group feedback on that technician in a garage. What is the garage itself doing? Is there a stream of work or does it look like a garage vulnerable to a downturn? My point is that there's a lot of information resident in the franchisees and their own employees, because some of them do have employees. And we try to incorporate that into our final decision when we make a credit choice.", "So as the model evolves, it's always enhanced. As the franchisees attempt to grow, they reach into new spaces, they meet new customers, those customers will have different credit profiles. And you adjust accordingly along the way.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Very good. Thanks again for taking my questions.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Savannah. We appreciate everyone joining the call today.

Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Leslie. Morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and speak a bit about our trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.", "In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 of last year.", "Our reported sales increase was 1.9% including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter. Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.", "For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I Group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance, another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the UK and Australia. And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. RS&I progress achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers, and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.", "For the Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group, we overcame some increased headwinds with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies. That said, in the third quarter, our European based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high-single-digit gains overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.", "Now our Industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity. We've consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized and our results included a double-digit decrease. Measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.", "Within our Natural Resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices, and you read about it in the newspapers. And despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, there will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame, because we're well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent the avenues for advancement and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.", "At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.", "Customer connection: Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals. Innovation: taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technologies. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the corporation. We were again honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards. The winners this time are 3/8-inch Drive Steering Rack Sockets and our SOLUS Edge diagnostic handheld.", "Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection derived from direct observation of work and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.", "In addition, also created out of deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid, TPMS, steering and clean diesel, and it all comes loaded with our Fast-Track Troubleshooter database with its vehicle specific tips, tests and time savers. The SOLUS Edge is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touch-screen display is an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds, quick.", "I mention these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct salespeople who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovations, and that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.", "Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, organic sales were up 3.4%, operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%, growth along with the benefits of Snap-on value creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds, but our Industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double-digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions.", "We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connections. Well, one way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer Lean events, participating in the customer sponsored Lean events, our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations, while at the same time gaining a better understanding of their work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and their overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through Lean event participation.", "One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of tube wrenches, great for heavy-duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant, these tube wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad applications, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly two-person slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.", "Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now, eight quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged \u2013 activity continues to be encouraging, but its profits are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there's much more room for further gains.", "And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand and Indonesia and Vietnam. Actually it's nice to see progress in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asia nation. So that provides a bit of color on C&I.", "Now, on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11%, 11%, significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins of 14.8% rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into significant margin improvement, and that 90 basis point gain overcame 120 basis points of negative currency.", "When you consider the Tools Group's success, you see the power of Snap-on value creation, and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Besides the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining five People's Choice selections for new tool innovation products, once again born at the intersection between customer connection insight and advanced technology wielded by our innovation teams, products like the KRL, 72-inch Roll Cab with its Power Tool Organizer System, the powerful and light CT8850, 18-volt cordless impact wrench, our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability, and our new EET2 full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of PTEN Magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.", "You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisees Conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington, D.C., with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our van space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.", "When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization, but especially within the Tools Group and Credit had a strong presence at the SFC. Supporting franchisees with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items, which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.", "Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin of 24.6%, it increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics to independents. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive, in medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offering. And one of those great RS&I product came from our diagnostics division, demonstrating its continuing innovation.", "Our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS Edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering. Thinner, lighter, including important features like five-second ready-to-use capability, five-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection input.", "In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have in it a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges, and initial sales of breaking the records and exceeding our expectations.", "Also in the third quarter and with the focus on heavy duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the Nexiq USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of Nexiq heavy duty diagnostics product. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol and nearly every software application in vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture, and of course heavy duty truck.", "Five times the speed of its predecessors with 16 times the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets, and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission critical vehicles and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product of our RS&I group.", "Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid with especially impressive increase \u2013 sales increases at our Challenger Lifts division. Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it improved again this quarter and we believe there is much more to come, helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all of that played out in the third quarter results.", "Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 7.3%, gains across all groups, clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities, customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new products, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results, OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically.", "On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increased to 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.", "Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.", "Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.", "Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense.", "No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%. Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 11.2%, and the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago.", "Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year. Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share, increased to $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segment's European-based hand tools business, and Asia-Pacific operations, and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.", "Gross profit in the C&I Group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.", "Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels, and the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.", "Turning now to slide 8.

The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment, and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products through independent repair shop owners and managers.", "Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and micellization sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring cost.", "Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels.

Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year end levels.", "The net decrease includes the impact of funding, $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million, and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations, net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans, and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises.

Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on third quarter, sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course as we say often, there will always be headwinds, always be challenges. But in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profits up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owner and managers activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points.", "Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers. Sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters. OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on value creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points including 50 basis points of currency headwinds. And rolling all together with financial services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.", "We believe that the third quarter results extending our positive trends continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.", "Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "A question on RS&I, you mentioned specific strength in undercar and service chain reported this morning, it had an 11% comp in alignment. Is there something structurally going on in that space driving growth or is yours tied to new product introduction? This row (00:32:51) deterioration is a secular shift or...?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I think structurally \u2013 not something happened and I don't think this particular quarter. But I think structurally the whole automotive repair business is \u2013 got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles. And in fact as you have more vehicles that want to do more things automatically, self-driving and so on. The precision of calibration becomes more and more important and therefore the more accuracy and speed \u2013 more accuracy \u2013 things like alignment become more important and therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important, therefore the need for new products. And so, I think it's nice times for automotive repair in general and in particular for undercar equipment. And I think...", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "And I guess...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "...ours being pushed by both at tailwind and some nice new product, that's in place as well.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And I guess, on that speed of change in technology \u2013 is sort of the next question, the software upgrade cycle as you were looking in the handheld units and replacing software, is that accelerating at all, or is the new code basically at the same cadence?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I think it's expanding. I think we're finding \u2013 I don't know, if we're introducing any faster necessarily upgrades, but I think the upgrades are more attractive. You hear me talk about SureTrack and if I had a little more time to talk about VERUS Edge, I would talk about the fact that it has technical service bulletins involved. And so, those products are more attractive and they're more liberating and they're more productivity advancing to customers and so that's driving part of that.", "You can see it. You can see \u2013 and I'm sure, you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars \u2013 we today require in all garages require diagnostics repairs and all garages require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics units. So you see a demand for that. And our software is the best available.", "One of the things you see in our \u2013 one of the things we're really excited about in our business when we did independent surveys of technician preferences, 63% said they preferred Snap-on diagnostics. Number two was 7%.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Does it help?", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. And one question I guess specifically to C&I on the U.S. military, you talked about it being particularly weak. When they are weak, are they buying less premium product or not buying at all? I mean, are they going to Harbor Freight for what they would have purchased for you or did they just step out?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "No. No. I don't think they are buying that stuff. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that they are not buying the stuff, because you know when the .50 caliber bullets are flying over head I think this is the ultimate critical application and I don't think anybody wants anybody being disadvantaged under those circumstances. So what really has happened by and large is the fact that there's uncertainty in where to deploy budget around. We've seen it before. Actually C&I, if you go back and look at the late \u2013 in late 2013, the critical industries, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military and that was directly associated with the word as sequestration. And so, you're starting to see those kinds of things now. In Washington people are talking about government shutdowns and so on and it's making the military nervous and they are spending less. We feel we're pretty well positioned though to take full advantage when they are ready to spend.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. So it's not trading down. It's just not spending.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "No. No. Not any significant way.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is now open.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning, Liam. How are you?", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Good. Thank you. Nick, you talked about railroad as being an interesting growth segment in C&I. Are there any other areas that saw particular strength during the quarter in the C&I?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, we were \u2013 amazingly, we're up pretty well in mining. Like I said, we're still starting to penetrate these things. So you can't \u2013 we're finding that we're effective sometimes by \u2013 somewhat by the environment, but not \u2013 we can overcome it at times and mining was one of those. Heavy truck was up fairly well in the quarter. So that was a good entry. General, if you just look at general production, the kinds of stuff, the things that are associated with grinders and so on, we had that kind of thing. So I mean we had some fairly reasonable positive points, the U.S. aviation, the aviation in U.S. was okay, that kind of thing.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "So we had some positives. And we had oil and gas, international aviation and the military which were negative.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And with your van channel being supported now with Rock N' Roll vans, are you seeing any step up in average ticket item per franchisee during the quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "No. Big ticket was still reasonably strong, but I think we're not seeing any particular, if the question is associated with the rise in the size of the \u2013 let's say the purchases, the size of the purchases, I would say no in the quarter necessarily, not anything particularly big in the quarter. Nothing that would change the trend. We're still seeing a robust demand though for things like tool storage and of course our diagnostic units and other things that we would roll into big ticket.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Your line is now open.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Couple of the questions have been answered, particularly on industrial. But let me just ask in terms of seeing pretty good growth year-over-year in the credit portfolio, is that still indicative of that there is a healthy appetite for the tool boxes, bigger ticket items?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, there's a healthy \u2013 I think there's a healthy attitude, generally it directly reflects the motion of the Tools Group. In general, if you look back at originations and look at Tools Group growth over the last three quarters, they're sort of the same, so that's pretty much what's driving it. I think it's not just tool boxes though, you get \u2013 you will get things like \u2013 you get things like big diagnostics like the VERUS Edge. I mean, the new VERUS Edge is a product that will run in several thousands of dollars and that can be financed on that kind of things. So, you will see a number of things like that. So, it's not just tool boxes, but it is \u2013 the big ticket items were, I think this quarter just slightly below, somewhat below the Tools Group in general, but over three quarters, four quarters has been better than the Tools Group.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then in terms of the Rock N' Roll vans and the techno vans, are you at capacity where you want to be right now in the U.S.?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't know. I think Rock N' Roll cab, I think we added like maybe like five in the last quarter in the techno vans and we didn't add any Rock N' Roll cabs. Rock N' Roll cabs have been solid for some time. Having said \u2013 been the same number for some time, but, you know, I wouldn't necessarily sign up to the idea that I wouldn't add more going forward. Rock N' Roll cabs were introduced somewhere in 2011. And I have to tell you, Gary, we've been learning about how to use them better and how effective they are and where they're most effective and how to do that each quarter. But for now, they're pretty much where they're going to be. The techno is something else. So we've added quite a few. I think actually year-over-year for techno, we've added 21 techno vans, and I think we'll be probably trying to see how that 21 plays out for a little while, and then we'll make a decision whether we need more or not going forward. But it's a mistake to think that tool storage sales is directly proportional to the number of Rock N' Roll cabs, that's not true. What we found is they've gotten more and more and more productive, more and more liberating every time, every quarter, and same thing for techno vans.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "All right. Well, it basically expands your store for selling space, right?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Correct, it does. But then we find out how to \u2013 then actually what we find out is how to amplify the Rock N' Roll space. I mean, it's kind of a multilayered thing. It does help that though. I mean in one sense it expands on a time-sharing basis the space, but the effect of that space, I would say over the four years we've had it, the ones that we installed first are helping a lot more than they did when they first occurred.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "And last question. Is this just the U.S. phenomenon or is this in other countries where mechanics own the tools that you have these kind of vans?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "It's in other countries. I mean I think, I guess we have seven international Rock N' Roll cabs, and so we've used them in different places, things like the UK, in Canada, and some in Australia. And we've just started to do that for the techno vans. So it's a phenomenon that can work in other places.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, everyone.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning, David.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So a couple of things, back on C&I. That's a business; you've got three or four different buckets of businesses within there.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "We do.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Tends to be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of a strange question, but is there any way or anything that we from the outside should look at to try and get a better handle on what the quarter-to-quarter trends are going to be there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't really have \u2013 the thing is that \u2013 the truth is, sure. What we know is the industry problems, the economic environments create an overhang. And then in places like, for us and you see it in oil and gas this time, you can see it in mining, although mining was a contributory for us. So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is look, the general macro is going to create an overhang. How well we do in offsetting it is another question, but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt, we feel when we look at Industrial, when we look at critical industries, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter, it was a drag on us this time, because we can see the gains in railroad, in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof-of-concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like, and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things that I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, I figured that...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "All I can tell you is I think we feel progress in each of those places.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, I just figured that was the answer. On Asia Pacific...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "...that business over the years, you've continued to see strong growth on the automotive equipment side of that business. What's the makeup of that revenue today between equipment versus the critical industries versus other pieces?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't really have the percentages for you. I will say that you're right in saying that equipment is probably the biggest piece of that, and then you've got cutting tools, which are another piece of it, which are primarily Industrial based. Industrial based tools are another piece, and then what's after that, it would be, I'd say, the critical \u2013 we call them \u2013 in that world (00:46:10) we call them premium tools, like the Snap-on tools sold into the super-premium applications like Thai Airways and things like that.", "We actually had a pretty good quarter with those in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. And the equipment actually was one of the things that drove us into Vietnam. We're actually pretty pleased about Vietnam. I've been waiting for Vietnam to give us some daylight for some time, and this is the quarter which it kind of worked. So it was an encouraging event.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. And then one last item here on margins. You guys did a great job of continuing to drive value and drive margins with the RCI activity and the focus on execution. Are you doing anything beyond what you normally do, cost cutting or pulling back on discretionary spending or anything along those lines, belt tightening with some of the uncertainties going on around the world?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "No. We're not doing anything like that. I mean I suppose it's kind of dumb thing for a guy like me to say that, but the fact our \u2013 we \u2013 okay, people here are shaking their heads, yes, that is dumb. But, okay.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So am I.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "It's true, we believe in our runways for growth, and we continue to invest in them. The profit improvements you are seeing, the 130 basis points, have nothing to do with restriction, nothing.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Because we don't see it that way. Of course, there are headwinds and they might impact us, and I never said we would keep going, marching upward every quarter. It's almost impossible for anybody to do that, although we have. And so we just believe in the future of extending the critical industries, enhancing the van channel, expanding with repair shop owners, and in emerging markets, so we keep investing in it.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Perfect, great. Thank you very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And Nick, congratulations on a great quarter.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Let me start off with just continuing on the point we were just discussing, and you talked about the fact that there wasn't a lot of belt tightening in this, but then you cite RCI progress in each of the individual segments. So let me reconcile this. It seems as though there has been some cost cutting. I'm looking specifically at the C&I segment, where you had a negative 5% incremental margin. In other words, revenues were down, but EBIT was up. And I know you've said repeatedly in the past that your RCI would allow you to grow margins in a flat revenue environment. Help me understand the answer you just gave to the last question versus these points.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. First of all, first of all, we view -- you may not like this either -- but we view as-reported sales as arithmetic. Organic sales are up for us, so the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that we're happy. We're encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down, that 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one.", "Two is, is that what you see in this situation is when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the set-up times in the factory, which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation, we brought \u2013 last year, in oil and gas, I think we \u2013 for heavy truck, let's say, we brought out 859 new products, and aviation was 996. And one of the things that allows us to make to do that better is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that cuts cost in the design cycle and allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "And even if we have \u2013 so, even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter, if it happens \u2013 if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well, maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter and I don't quite get the quote at the same benefit.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I appreciate that clarification.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah, I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. On the originations, it's up 16%. Once again it's kind of an up 9% number last quarter. Is that really just timing?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, it's pretty much. Yeah, there's a lot of timing flowing through. Remember that originations have to do with the franchisees selling the products.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Right. And you also got an SFC that flows through this. So, in originations are things like loans that go through for the franchisees themselves, like van loans and things like that that occur. And so there's that noise in van originations in the month. So when we have a particularly great SFC, that can distort that as well. But when you step back and you look at the trend of everything, it really is \u2013 there is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. You've kind of got to look back. And if you look at three quarters, you'll see it's pretty close to the same, between Tools Group growth and originations, pretty close to the same and if you say that Tools Group will pick a group faster, it makes sense.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Military and oil and gas, is there any way you can size that up for us as a percentage of critical industries...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay. (00:51:55). I'll try this \u2013 how about this one. We mentioned like five segments, six segments in critical industries, and the military is a big one, it's the biggest because we entered there first, because it made sense. Just as I said before, when the bullets are flying overhead -- I can assure you this from personal experience, when the bullets are flying overhead, people kind of want to make sure things work. And so we figured it was the most critical of industries. We invested in it and it (00:52:16) warrants bigger. So if you take our revenues which is somewhere north of $450 million or something like that let's say, and you divide them by six and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas would be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this. You got one big guy who is down strong double digits, can put a little over hang on you.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Let me just ask one last question, just relating to the call here and just kind of a big picture high level question, but if you could just walk us through with some quick comments on each of the four segments. You just discussed recessionary environment, how much downside would you expect in revenues? And also, I guess, with all the progress in RCI initiatives and the new product introductions in the much richer portfolio, how much better, if at all, would margins be in the trough than what we saw last time around?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Last time around we started at 12% and went to 10%. The 12.3%, if I remember 2008, the OI percentage was like 12.3% and it went to 9.9%.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "And that was \u2013 the 9.9% was, I would say, artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition, somewhat, not huge, but that's a factor there a little bit. And so, you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much, but okay, we had that transition going on in Tools Group and so on, maybe arithmetically it didn't affect. But down there, we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there now is we're starting at 17.5%, all right. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that duration.", "The other factor I'd offer is this, is I believe \u2013 two factors. One is, I believe we are stronger in our market positions, therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two \u2013 number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the \u2013 70% of the customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor, they were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People were talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure \u2013 and so therefore they didn't buy big ticket items even though they had a lot of cash.", "That would happen again, but I'm not sure it'd be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call of course. And one more experience at RCI than we were. And the other thing is, we're just better at RCI, and so we probably step that up. If you can't, you only have 24 hours in a day, so if you can't \u2013 if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "That's really helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Just as it relates to the Tools Group, certainly positive results from both the domestic and international businesses. Nick, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little additional color in regards to the contribution for the international franchise business in the Tools Group?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "The international franchise business is about, is also up double-digits. The U.S. is up strong double-digits, the U.S. is up, the international is up just about the same. I would say that in order the strength, Australia and UK were actually up more than the U.S., Canada was up somewhat less, so you put those together in a cocktail and I think it all came to about the same as the U.S.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then I guess looking a little bit of bigger picture, I think you've kind of tested on some components so far today. Clearly an opportunity for you is to get a larger percentage of the shop related spending. Just what are your thoughts on where you are on the penetration rates when you look at complete shop spending and some of your initiatives to expand that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, let's look at it this way. I think I would say that we are less than half of where we are in terms of our position with tools. And so, if you think of it that way, yes, people respect our brand, shop owners respect our brand as much as technicians. So I would view that as kind of an \u2013 view of the opportunity. We think we have runway in the tools itself for the technicians and we're well behind that in terms of shop penetration. So, I think we've got quite a bit of runway there. I would say if you want to use baseball terms, we're in the third or fourth inning.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Leslie Kratcoski for any closing remarks.", "Leslie H.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Rica, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter 2012 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Please refer to our earnings release issued this morning and to the slides accompanying this webcast for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to those most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As we normally do on these calls, I'll begin with some of the highlights of our second quarter and I'll provide my perspective on the business and on the various markets in which we operate. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials.", "I will say that we were encouraged by the results. EPS of $1.30 represents a rise of 14% from last year's comparable $1.14. Organic sales were up 4.5% despite the clear headwinds of Europe. The OpCo operating margin of 14.2% increased 60 basis points, overcoming an $8.3 million in higher restructuring charges. And Financial Services added $25.6 million in operating earnings, up from a comparable $17.5 million in 2011.", "I'll remind you that in the second quarter of last year, we resolved the dispute with our former Financial Services joint venture partner and recorded at that time a one-time $18 million pretax arbitration settlement gain. That settlement was worth $0.19 a share. And given the nature of the item, I've excluded it, as we believe it's appropriate from the FinCo earnings and the EPS comparisons I just referenced.", "On balance though, the quarter was another positive point, extending an encouraging growth trend. That continuing trend demonstrates significant progress along our clearly defined runways for growth. Extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in vehicle repair shops.", "And the operating margin expansion is a reflection of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes at work. As I said before, these are a crucial set of principles that we apply every day. A focus on safety, on quality, customer connection, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI and on innovation. It's a powerful framework and it is helping to fuel our results. I mentioned that the OpCo operating margin expanded by 60 basis points from last year, but I'll also point out that this year's restructuring charge in the second quarter included $6.8 million for the settlement of a pension plan related to our Canadian tools storage facility, which we closed last year. But for that item, the margin expansion would have been 150 basis points. That increased profitability is a strong testimony that the positive contributions of Snap-on value creation.", "Now regarding sales growth. The numbers appeared to validate that we are building advantage in each of the 4 areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Critical industries where the penalty for failure is high. Another double-digit gain for our industrial division, with the growth rate in the aerospace sector leading the way.", "Emerging markets. In addition to strong double-digit gains in China, as you probably would expect, we also saw a particularly large uplifts in places like Indonesia and Russia.", "The franchise channel what we call auto mechanics or auto technicians, volume is up 10% in the quarter with strong operating margin.", "And finally, in vehicle repair shops, we saw growth in categories that are quite important to those shop owners and managers. Sales in the RS&I business that provide diagnostic units, repair information and shop management systems were up high single digits.", "So we're clearly progressing along each of our runways for growth. That said, Europe remains a major headwind, no surprise to anybody I guess. The macro -- and the macroeconomic environment in Europe -- but the macroeconomic environment in Europe is muting the progress being achieved in other arenas.", "As in the first quarter, the mature markets in Europe were down from last year, but we're somewhat encouraged that despite the general news, the comparison hasn't gotten any worse since the last quarter. Overall, Europe remains a mixed story. The core mature markets are down similar to last quarter and the emerging east, especially Russia, continues to expand robustly. It helps to offset the larger declines in the South. So Europe remains a challenge. But for us, it's been that way for some time and on balance we've been able to navigate the turbulence and register encouraging results overall.", "Now let's have some of the highlights for each of the segments. The C&I group. The C&I group grew organically by 5.1%. This is a group of businesses where we have much of our focus on emerging markets and on serving customers in critical industries, and there was strong progress in each of those runways. Our Asian operation and our industrial division, the bellwether of our critical industry activity, both registered double-digit increases versus last year. But the C&I group besides being the home of our critical industries and our emerging market efforts is also the home of SNA Europe and the ongoing challenges of that particular geography. That means the overall C&I growth was achieved while more than offsetting -- that growth was achieved by more than offsetting the turbulence of Europe.", "Now the operating margin in the C&I segment was 11.6%, up from 10.4% last year. And this year's results at 11.6%, includes $3.2 million in restructuring, substantially greater than the $0.5 million we spent last year. Given that C&I is where we have our largest European footprint, the results are encouraging. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving improvements and our growth runways are yielding results.", "In the industrial division, the critical industry center, we have solid gains in serving natural resource customers.", "We also had strong growth in aerospace and aviation. It was a highlight of the quarter. So I'll offer some color on that sector. Aviation certainly fits the definition of a critical industry. And in that way, our automated net area -- our Automated Tool Control unit, ATC, continues to be an important product that raises -- that has raised Snap-on's profile. Each quarter, this high-tech package, which improves productivity, along with asset control, is showing up on more flightlines. We're seeing it in more repair maintenance and overhaul operations and in more aircraft mechanic training facilities. Coupled with our expanding tool offering, we're filling those smart boxes with a wide array of Snap-on products and fueling industrial division growth.", "Another example of focus on aviation customers is during the quarter, we began serving with far greater intensity, the airline maintenances -- the largest airline maintenance facility in the United States. A location that employs over 4,000 technicians. They wanted Snap-on there full-time, and we accommodated. So focus, product and presence. We're expanding each in the critical industries and it's paying off.", "One final note on aviation. It's an area that's importantly driving international expansion for Snap-on, helping to offset some of the European impacts. In fact, our international rise in the industrial division actually outpaced the growth in the U.S. More and more, we're selling expanded toolkits around the globe to airlines, to aircraft manufacturers and in support of military F15 and F35 fighter fleets.", "Now speaking of international expansion in Asia, our new Undercar products, designed specifically for customers in that region, help drive the double-digit growth of our Asia-Pacific operation. This high visibility, high-value product category is particularly important in emerging markets. And in both India and China, we saw growth rates for our undercar equipment that substantially exceeded our overall growth rates for those countries. As the repair wave rises in Asia, we were particularly well-positioned and aligner sales are a testimony to that effect.", "Moving to the Tools Group. Volumes were up strongly in the second quarter, rising 10% above last year's level. The operating margin of 13.7% compares to 15.5% last year. Now remember, this year's results do include $6.8 million of restructuring charges for the pension settlement related to last year's facilities closure. Without that charge, the margin this year would have been 15.8%. I believe that these overall numbers speak to the absolute strength of the van channel and to the trends that continue to be positive. We believe, we believe strongly that enhancing the Van network is an important runway for Snap-on. One way we're doing that is with innovative new marketing campaign, generating excitement with mechanic customers. In the second quarter, we launched what we call our Masters of Metal Tour. It's a traveling caravan that offers -- it offers an outstanding opportunity for new as well as already committed customers to experience firsthand Snap-on's latest innovations and our hottest tool offering. That customized the mobile showcase celebrates automotive technician as masters of their trade, and Snap-on factory associates as masters of their craft. It features state-of-the-art touch screen technology and it gives attendees the opportunity to see just how Snap-on innovative products are designed and are engineered. Each tour is also paired with an especially equipped truck that we call the rock 'n roll cab. It's loaded with a large range of tool storage product that allows those big ticket products, big ticket boxes to be presented with a visibility and a variety that's not possible on a typical franchisee van. When the Snap-on tour comes to town, it really is quite an event. Generally taking on a party like atmosphere. Oftentimes it coincides with a car show or a fund raiser for a worthy cause and the local franchisees gather their vans right alongside that mobile tour to demonstrate and sell their tools and all this serves to generate significant brand exposure for Snap-on. It's been one of the drivers behind our robust tools group growth this quarter.", "One of the innovative products that -- it's got a number of products on this tour, but one of innovative products highlighted on that tour is our new line of quick release ratchets. They incorporate our unique dual 80 technology, along with a locking feature that holds the socket in place when needed and a push button for easy removal. That's a clear productivity enhancer. But in the past, these types of ratchets were considered to be not as durable as traditional tools. Well, Snap-on engineering has made the new ratchets, almost 30% stronger than the competition. We believe that the best such product on the market and the reception seems to confirm just that.", "I've often talk about big-ticket sales in this conference -- in these calls. Big-ticket items in the Tools Group in particular, higher dollar purchases of diagnostics and tool storage units. These purchases represent a larger commitment and therefore, they serve as a barometer of customer's financial well-being as well as their confidence. While sales of big-ticket units -- items remain at robust levels, in fact tools storage sales have been particularly strong as a result of the rock 'n roll cab. Not only are these cabs traveling with the Masters of Metal Tour, we also have a small fleet of them, operating singly, accompanying individual franchisees to repair shop location, calling on technicians with unique mobile showrooms. I'll tell you, when these cabs go into a franchise route, they drive tools storage sales and you can see that in the Tools Group second quarter numbers.", "So that's some of the highlights of the Tools Group. Now on to the Repair System & Information or RS&I Group. This is where we server primarily garage owners and managers, and we're expanding Snap-on's presence throughout the vehicle repair shop. Sales in RS&I were up only slightly, 0.2% from last year. RS&I does have a large undercar equipment business in Europe that was down, reflecting the overall macros. Upside of Europe, for both the overall RS&I group and for the undercar equipment business, the gains were mid-single digits. So I think it's fair to say that the group is moving forward, but that progress is masked by the European turbulence.", "Now operating margin. Operating margin for RS&I rose strongly to 23%, up substantially from 20.9% last year. That increase was driven by growth, high single digits in the higher-margin businesses. The operations that provide, as I said before, diagnostics, repair information, shop management systems to the independent garages, all places where Snap-on has great products and strong position.", "Speaking of independent shops, last quarter I mentioned the launch of our new Mitchell 1 repair information products. We call it ProDemand. I'll give you a quick update.", "This new software enhances technician productivity. It offers faster and more accurate searches, and improved access to other online data like wiring diagrams and technical service bulletins. It's been a big hit. Customer enthusiasm is apparent and we're expanding our position as a result, that's one of the reasons why we're seeing these sales up in this area. Another innovation helping expand Snap-on's presence in the garage is our recently launched alignment audit system. It uses computerized 3D modeling, high resolution cameras, armed with an extensive database of vehicle information to provide a quick alignment audit. It significantly improves shop efficiency, and it does generate more shop revenue. With the new Snap-on system, any service technician can perform the audit in approximately 60 seconds and present the customer with a complete color-coded report that helps sell needed service that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Early reaction, I have to tell you, has been very positive. With shop managers commenting that the unit provides a better return on investment than any other equipment currently available. The Snap-on alignment audit system joins a list of other new undercar equipment products like our RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer, which just won an innovation award at an important trade show in Germany. Our new selling automatic tire changer, our new aligner specifically designed for the Russian market, all of those are good strong new products in this segment.", "Customer connection and innovation, Snap-on Value Creation Processes, resulting in attractive new products that are helping us to expand with vehicle shop owners and managers. Heavy duty diagnostics has been another positive for RS&I. We made a commitment a few years back to expand in that area, and that effort is paying off with good growth rates. We started expanding in government fleets, an attractive opportunity that would not have been possible without the investments. So all these innovative products from ProDemand information system to the alignment audit have been crucial in offsetting Europe and in driving strong profitability, the strong profitability for RS&I.", "So those are the highlights as I see them. Overcoming headwinds to post sales gains, expanding operating margins and clear progress along our strategic runways. The second quarter was an encouraging confirmation that even in turbulent times, our strategic initiatives -- even in turbulent time, continue to offer growth and our Snap-on value creation continues to drive improvement.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the second quarter totaled $737.9 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 4.5%, led by double-digit growth in Snap-on tools and across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries.", "Consolidated gross profit of $349.9 million in the quarter increased $7.7 million from 2011 levels, and gross margin of 47.4% improved 30 basis points from 47.1% last year.", "Operating expenses of $245.3 million in the quarter were up $1.9 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin improved 30 basis points from 33.5% last year to 33.2% this year.", "Restructuring cost in the quarter of $10.2 million were higher by $8.3 million as compared to prior year levels, largely due to the inclusion of $6.8 million as anticipated for the settlement of a pension plan, following last year's closure of the new market Canada tool storage facility.", "Operating earnings before Financial Services of $104.6 million increased $5.8 million year-over-year and improved as a percentage of sales, 60 basis points from 13.6% last year to 14.2% this year despite 110 basis points of higher year-over-year restructuring cost.", "Operating earnings from Financial Services of $25.6 million in the quarter increased $8.1 million or 46.3% from comparable 2011 levels, which exclude last year's $18 million arbitration settlement gain.", "Operating earnings of $130.2 million in the quarter increased $13.9 million from comparable prior year levels, excluding the settlement gain. And operating margin improved 130 basis points from 15.4% a year ago to 16.7% this year.", "Finally, net earnings in the second quarter of $76.4 million or $1.30 per diluted share increased 14.2% from comparable 2011 levels of $66.9 million or $1.14 per share, again excluding the settlement gain related to last year's earnings, we had $1.33.", "Now let's turn to our segment results starting with the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $283.4 million for the quarter were up 5.1% organically from 2011 levels, primarily as a result of continued double-digit sales increases across the majority of our businesses, serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries. These increases were partially offset by mid-single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business as a result of further market weakness, particularly in Southern Europe.", "Gross profit of $104.3 million in the quarter increased $1.9 million from 2011 levels, and gross margin of 36.8% improved 20 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. These gross margin improvements were partially offset by $2.6 million of higher restructuring cost to improve the segment's cost structure in Europe.", "Operating expenses of $71.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.7 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin of 25.2% improved 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage.", "As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings of $32.8 million for the C&I segment increased 12.3% from 2011 levels. Operating margin of 11.6% in the quarter improved 120 basis points from 10.4% last year despite a 90 basis point impact from the higher restructuring cost.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $325 million increased to $29.5 million or 10% organically, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. Gross profit of $137 million increased $4.6 million from 2011 levels despite $6.2 million of higher year-over-year restructuring cost, as anticipated, that settled a new market pension plan.", "As a result of the expected higher restructuring cost, gross margin of 42.2% in the quarter declined 210 basis points from 44.3% last year.", "Operating expenses of $92.5 million in the quarter increased $6.3 million from 2011 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.5% improved 30 basis points, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and contributions from ongoing RCI initiatives.", "Operating earnings of $44.5 million in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group declined $1.7 million from $46.2 million last year, as contributions from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by expected higher restructuring cost.", "Operating margin of 13.7% in the quarter decreased 180 basis points from 15.5% last year, including 190 basis point impact from the higher restructuring cost.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $227.4 million increased $0.4 million organically from 2011 levels as a high single-digit sales gain of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products was partially offset by reduced undercar equipment sales in Europe and a low single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships.", "Gross profit of $108.6 million in the quarter increased $1.2 million from prior year levels. Gross margin of 47.8% in the quarter improved 200 basis points from 45.8% last year, primarily due to a more favorable sales mix that included higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products.", "Gross margin also reflected savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, including contributions from design cost reduction. Operating expenses of $56.4 million in the quarter decreased $2 million from 2011 levels, and the operating expense margin improved 10 basis points to 24.8%. Operating earnings of $52.2 million for the RS&I group increased $3.2 million or 6.5% and operating margin improved 210 basis points to 23%.", "Now turning to Slide 10. Second quarter earnings from Financial Services of $25.6 million increased $8.1 million, excluding last year's settlement gain, primarily due to continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $175.6 million in the quarter rose 14.7%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segments and increased participation in our credit programs.", "Moving to Slide 11. As of second quarter end, our balance sheet included just over $1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $854 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $156 million from our international finance subsidiaries.", "In the U.S., $693 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2011 year end, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $75 million. The pace of the portfolio's growth has continued as expected and is naturally decelerating as the transition of the CIT-owned portfolio nears completion. In 2012, we continue to anticipate that for the full-year, the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $91.7 million for the quarter includes the effect of $20 million of additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans. In 2012, we also intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and depending on market and other conditions, may make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. plans. The $91.7 million of cash provided this quarter from operating activities compares with the $13.7 million use of cash in the second quarter of last year, which primarily resulted from the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT following last year's arbitration settlement.", "Capital expenditures totaled $18 million in the quarter and $40 million year-to-date. For the full-year, we currently anticipate capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million, including the construction of a fourth factory at our Kunshan China location, which is expected to be completed by year end.", "As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 56 days improved from 58 days as of 2011 year end. Inventories increased $15 million from 2011 year-end levels, largely to support continued higher demand in the United States. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.9x compared to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $174 million decreased to $12 million from 2011 year-end levels. Primarily due to the continued funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, U.S. pension contributions of $45 million, share repurchases of $38.1 million and dividend payments of $39.6 million. These year-to-date uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations.", "Our net debt to cap ratio of 33.2% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $174 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. As of the second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.", "This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. We are encouraged by the second quarter results. More than anything else, we believe that it confirms Snap-on's abundant runway for improvement and for growth. It extends our favorable trend, achieved despite turbulence in Europe, which given our position in Spain has been with us for some time. The quarter shows we are making strategic progress in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future. The Van network is stronger. Sales were up double digits again with the U.S. leading the way. We are extending into critical industries, also up by double digits in the quarter. A strong position is being built in emerging markets. Sales growing substantially above local GDPs and physical capabilities, factories, product lines, distribution, all strengthening.", "And we do see progress with repair shop owners and managers. Although overall RS&I is flat, the crucial high margin core of diagnostics, repair information and shop management systems grew at high single digits, bringing RS&I profitability to a high level. And again this quarter, we're seeing Snap-on Value Creation Processes, driving progress on our runways for improvement. OpCo OI percent of 14.2%, up 60 basis points despite substantially increased restructuring.", "I think everybody knows that these are interesting times and there are challenges. But we've been facing headwinds like Spain for some time. We're confident of our capabilities, encouraged by our strengthening position, focused on our abundant opportunities and believe that we will continue to find advantage despite the turbulence.", "Before I close, I believe it's appropriate to recognize that Snap-on's results and the encouraging trends reflect the extraordinary effort and our strong commitment and the strong commitment of our associates and our franchisees around the world. I know many of them listen to this call, so for your energy, for your dedication and for your support, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question, Mike Wherley with Janney Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit about the critical industries. You mentioned that you signed on with a large airline maintenance facility, and I'm wondering, are there other potential opportunities like that and do they deliver the same margins that you might get in your other critical industries business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "There are different -- there are many more opportunities. Of course, that's the biggest one, the United States, that's why mentioned it. But what I meant there was focus, product and presence. And at the base of our extension into critical industries, is the fact that in the past, Snap-on would sell on an almost default basis to some of those customers. We were calling on the 4,000 -- we were calling on that site, but very sporadically. We never focused on it as a distinct customer base that we wanted to solve their problems and make their work easier. And this an example of what we will be doing around the country with other places, focus on them, call on them as they need, provide a product line that fits them. Now we're doing that there, it's just early days, we started that in the quarter, but there are many other places to do that in -- to do the same thing. Regarding margins, the margins are just as good with that business as they are throughout the corporation.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And is it something where you have sort of a direct way to sell to those technicians or is it something where the maintenance facility just buys them for the technician?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's a mix. In this particular, in fact, I think, in this facility, it's a mix, the facilities buy some and the technicians buy some. And we sell it through a direct presence that's there virtually every day. It's kind of a direct sale. And if you look at the landscape throughout the country or throughout the world, you would find a mix of what you just described. In some facilities, the facility buys and provides the tools and in other facilities it\u2019s the technicians themselves.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other question I had on the...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "But let offer, in any case, that's a classic example of a Snap-on positioning. It's why it doesn't matter to us so much who buys because the buyer is not -- is usually not a corporate buyer, it's a buyer located very close to the point of use. Even if it's the facility, he's up close -- that buyer is up close and personal to the technician themselves, so the technician has a great influence on what actually gets purchased. So that means that our -- the capabilities of the Snap-on products are quite appreciated and weigh heavily in the purchase, that's why we get the margins.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And will you be extending credit to those technicians?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. The other question I have was just on the restructuring that you're doing in Europe to sort of reset those cost levels in the S&A Europe. Is that complete, and when do you expect the benefits to sort of be fully realized?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's not complete. That's an ongoing basis. You'll probably be some more restructuring going forward, the kind of restructuring you've seen in other quarters if you look back in our history, you'll see we're kind of controlled restructurers and we have had restructuring in most quarters. And you're going to see that in our future, much of it directed at S&A Europe, so that will happen. When you see benefits, I would say, it's hard to say it varies from project to project, but a good rule of thumb would be to say 2 year paybacks. And that will give you some indication of how -- what gets off it from the spending.", "Operator", "David Leiker, Robert W. Baird.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is John Wein [ph] for David. Just on the C&I margin this quarter, it was up 140 bps on what essentially is flat revenue quarter-over-quarter. I'm just wondering what exactly is going on there. Whether it's mix or some of the European restructuring already is starting to take place?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think it's -- I don't know what you mean by flat. I think it's up 5.5% on an organic basis.", "Unknown Analyst", "Sequentially, sorry.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Right. Are you saying sequential?", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes, sorry.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think 5.5%. If you're talking about recorded -- reported, that has currency inside it. But on an organic basis, it's up -- it is sequentially flat, I know. What you're seeing in C&I is a number of different things. One is, of course, the effect of the Snap-on Value Creation Process as we obviously turns a focus on it in the past couple of quarters so you're seeing that flow through in terms of things like RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement. And then you are seeing some improvements in Europe and the bottom line associated with some of those restructuring coming through. So you're seeing both of those effects happening. I don't think you can call it a mix thing. We're not seeing much mix in C&I. So that's -- what you're seeing there is pure productivity.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, great. On the -- for a long time, you've had kind of a 15% OI margin target for the OpCo. And essentially, you're already there if you make the adjustments. I'm just wondering when looking ahead and looking the further leverage you can pull, is it more on the manufacturing side where we could expect a greater improvement in gross margins? Is it on the operating expenses or SG&A? Just any feel you might have for that.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think it's all of the above there. I think there are -- I think we've said fairly consistently over the years that we see 2 distinct runways. One, what you're referring to are runways for improvement, but Rapid Continuous Improvement, driving better efficiency and productivity even at flat sales. And you'll see that play out both in gross margin and in SG&A and in operating expense. And then, you'll see leverage associated with growth that goes forward because we believe those runways are open to us. Things like extending the critical industries and expanding in the repair garage and building in emerging markets, and the Van network, which has been mid-double digits for 3 or 4 quarters now. So I can see all 3 of those things in play. A kind of efficiencies around both areas and margins and expenses, and the leverage associated with volume. Now I'll quickly say that the leverage is not as -- leverage isn't always as definable each and every quarter as you might think, because sometimes you get more sales and the RCI effect to handle all sales to raise the productivity of your factory doesn't adjust quickly enough and you'll get some inefficiencies at first, and as RCI catches up, that drops to the bottom line much more effectively. You get that leverage. We see that in some of our results, particularly the Tools Group this time. The other thing I'd emphasize pretty carefully, as I look out and I see these runways for growth, and I see that growth happening and I see the operating margin happening, this is over a longer term. When we look forward to the third quarter, for example, everybody will probably want to know about the third quarter, this is the most uncertain quarter for us every year. There's a lot of windage in our third quarters. So we see things like the effects of European vacations and the effects of the Van vacations. Remember the van drivers are owner-operators, usually single person in the business. So when they take the couple weeks off or a week off for a vacation, the Van doesn't roll. So our third quarter is not a trend quarter. It's a quarter that has a lot of variation in it. But when you look out over time, we're going to see that -- those 3 things in place, leverage and productivity improvements both at the gross margin line and the operating expense line.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Just wondering given where the euro is and the potential headwind it creates, how much of your SG&A is incurred in Europe or denominated in euros?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I guess, I don't know if I have that number exactly. I can offer this to you that about -- what do we say, about 22% of our business is in Europe. And the euro denomination about 15% of our activity is in the euro currency. So if that's helpful.", "Unknown Analyst", "No, yes, that's helpful. And then my last one is on the growth in the Tools Group. You add Mac Tools had high single-digit growth during the quarter. So you've obviously beat that, and I'm guessing if I just did a U.S. to U.S. comp, your U.S. tools business grew above the 10% that the overall segment did, so I'm just...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, it did.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. So just trying to get a sense of -- from my side what exactly is going on, and one of the things just kind of thinking about it, having the credit operation internally now, have you been able to kind of pull some levers or maybe do some creative promotions now that you're managing that, that you weren't able to do when CIT was running it? That might be helping you capture incremental tool buyers?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, you said a lot of great things there that are accurate. Let me just say first, the tools group has put together 3 or 4 outstanding growth quarters around 9%, 10%. And you have to give credit to the team there. They are hitting. In baseball parlance, they are pounding the ball. And so a lot of credit has to be given to that team for this. And what you're seeing with them are a couple of things. One is, is that we have some great new products, like I talked about, the ratchet -- the flexible ratchet. Then we have the marketing efforts like the rock 'n roll cab which is generating to think about it, a van is really small and so how many boxes can a van driver carry on his van? So when the mechanic gets on, he can only see 2 colors or 2 sizes, the rock and roll cabbie can see a whole wall of this stuff and so it generates a sort of the impulse purchase. And so you're seeing that great marketing effort. And then, our van network has been just getting stronger and stronger when you look at the health metrics of the van, the sales were up, the equity is up, the terminations are down -- just gotten stronger right off the recession because we invested in them. And finally, we've invested in productivity in our vans. So that our drivers are spending more time selling. So you've got those 3 things happening, you got all 4 things happening, that's driving those sales. And so that's how I explain that, the van business and the expansion there.", "Operator", "Dax Vlassis with Gates Capital Management.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "Nick, just curious on the margin side. If you add back the restructuring charges, you're well in excess of a 15% target. I'm just wondering there was another question about this -- the growth of that and the sustainability of that. Can you speak to the new benchmark you've sort of set as far as margins in the go forward from here if -- some of that...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Okay. I'm really happy about the 15.8% in tools and the number without it. But it's one quarter, so I don't know if I'm actually resetting my benchmarks yet. I've got to think about it. And I would also say that when you look -- I just want to emphasize, when you look forward, things happen from quarter-to-quarter, we feel pretty good about our trends, but this is one quarter and I am confident in our upward trend. I am confident in the runways for growth and improvement. But I'm not sure I yet want to reset my target based on one quarter achieving it.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "But around this level, let's say, in the first half of this year, did you feel that's a sustainable margin sort of basis to look at the business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure. I think so, but I want to say that we've been here -- we're just getting to this level. And when I say something, I don't mean every quarter.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "Of course.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Every quarter. I'm talking about -- I think it's a great sustainable direction. I've already said that the third quarter is kind of squirrely, and you never predict anything about this. But I think over trend -- over the trends, this is a good base for thinking about our business. And I've also said to so many, I think maybe I said to you when I met with you, is that I believe that Snap-on. And I've been around the block. This is not my first rodeo. I've been around the block and Snap-on has a great, great franchise in the broadest sense in terms of brand, in terms of products, in terms of customer reception, customer loyalty and if we can't get top level returns, then we'd be disappointed.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "And then my second question is around the cash flow. It looks like, especially given the contributions that the free cash flow cash, flow from ops minus CapEx that you generated in the quarter was the highest in 2 years. It's great to see you generating such strong cash. Can you talk about your future? It looks like you're stepping up a little bit on the CapEx for the second half of the year. And can you just talk about your working capital management and whether you expect to sustain this great cash flow? And then on top of that, to add on to that question is uses of cash. Can you talk about the acquisition environment and if there's any areas that you can put a larger amount of shareholder capital to work at good returns?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I think, talking about moving forward, our uses of cash, I think I've said in the past are to invest in the business, and you've seen us step up CapEx. I think we raised our target this time because we can see opportunities to invest in, particularly in things like capacity and so on we can -- and in emerging markets. So we can see great opportunities for payback in those things and we're actually getting more capable in spending. So one of the things that keeps you -- that makes this possible is we're just getting more effective in managing those CapEx expenditures. Secondly, you just talked about it, the working capital, as you grow, you need working capital. I have cautioned everybody that I don't see working capital as a source of cash going forward. It will be probably a use of cash going forward because we expect to grow. And then I see M&A, I see acquisitions around the coherency of our businesses, around the critical industries, around the repair shops serving owners and managers and in emerging markets. I see acquisitions to make in those areas. And so those are the places where we'll be spending our money.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "But have you seen any -- are you closer to doing something than you have been in the past or is it...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't think we'd comment on those kinds of things. But I think we are obviously closer. We're getting further out of the credit company.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management, Inc.", "My final question is with respect to the earning assets of the FinCo. Is there any -- I mean, I know there's going to be some further growth for the rest of this year given the targets that you sort of set for '12, but it's really not that much in capital investments from here as far as receivables and contract receivables or finance receivables. What would be the growth rate past '12? Are we getting to the point where you're not going to have to make any more investments and it'll just be pure cash that rolls off from the operating income of that business?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "This is Aldo. Just to comment, Dax, I think if you look past 2012, the growth of Snap-on Credit will be more closely aligned to the growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Largely the CIT transition will have been completed by the end of this year. So whatever the Tools Group grows, it won't -- they never match up perfectly quarter-to-quarter, but it's a good reflection. And what that means is that you'll still probably see the portfolio growth, be consuming slightly more cash than what you would get if you allocate interest expense and taxes as we do in our cash flow slide to the Financial Services segment. So there'll still be a user of cash to some extent, but not to the extent that it is today.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Let me just add one thing at the end. I think I mentioned the use of cash, and I take it as a given around here and that is dividend. We have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have not reduced it. So that's part of our DNA here. So that would be another use of cash that I want to make sure that I don't overlook when I discuss it here.", "Operator", "Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Going through your narrative, you mentioned some countries in Europe that were particularly strong. And I couldn't all write that down. Could we go through that? I mean, and then some of the weaker ones...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think I only mentioned Russia pretty much in Europe in the script anyway, but you can think of -- really what we're talking about, Gary is the periphery, the Eastern Europe and we put Turkey in there and things like Belarus and other places. If you think about -- actually the Maghreb countries would be part of that. So they would be -- we happen to sell into Northern Africa. So I kind of think of it as a circle around Europe. In the middle, we're selling some in those areas. So that's where the business is up. Why we're encouraged by that is that, that seems to us to confirm that the business in Europe is still robust and has a great value proposition as long as the economies are unafflicted, people keep buying.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So these are newer countries to you, so this would be considered part of your emerging markets initiatives or am I incorrect?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I think mostly, mostly. Actually not North Africa so much. We've been in North America for the dog\u2019s age. But Russia and Belarus and places like that.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "What I'm trying to get at -- so in your established countries, you said Spain and Italy are bad. Very bad. As you went through the quarter, ex Spain and Italy, in your more established countries, did you start to see a slower growth if that's the best word or more...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, what we saw -- those are down. It is like this. How I would describe Europe is like this. The Spain, deep reductions. Spain -- the Southern Europe is deep reduction. As we've seen, the periphery up robustly and the core is mid-single digits down. That's what we're seeing. And what we -- I think a one little nuance in this call is -- or this report is we're not seeing decelerate -- we're not seeing acceleration of that downward motion. It's still down, but the comparisons are about the same. But they haven't gotten worse. That's sort of the report I would give you as our look on Europe.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So it doesn't feel like it did in 2008?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, yes, right. Well, 2008 -- 2008, yes. It doesn't feel like that. It doesn't feel like it was in the first quarter. I think things -- we thought things, the fourth and the first quarter of 2011 and the first quarter, we saw things getting deeper. On a year-over-year basis, things aren't getting any deeper now. They're still agony on a year-over-year basis. But it isn't -- the hole isn't deepening.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just kind of a rhetorical question, I mean, your sales were up about 1.5% quarter-over-quarter. Without foreign currency, it was about 4%. And even given that low single-digit sales growth numbers, if we extrapolate that going forward, do you still feel these RCI initiatives would be enough to expand your margins even with such sluggish sales growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "First, I beg to -- if it's possible for me, I beg to differ a little bit in your characterization of 4.5% as low. I have always characterized our growth as 4% to 6% organically. And 4.5% Is within that range. And so, therefore, from my perspective, this is just another data point. I never said we were going to hit 5% every year right in the middle of that in the quarter. So to me, the organic growth is kind of what you expect. We'll see some bigger than that. But I like being in the range. And I believe Snap-on value creation, I think I've said this before, Snap-on value creation, it authors improved profitability at flat sales, let alone small growth, small growth. So I think that's a factor, of course, your margin expansion gets slower then, but you still get that -- you still get margin expansion.", "Operator", "Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just a few quick questions here. With the economy here in the states appearing to slow down a little bit, are -- your driver is saying and are you seeing fundamentals in the repair businesses still holding up? I know the revenues were good in the quarter still, especially in the Snap-on Tool business, but I'm just curious here as you exited the quarter, what some of the driver feedback you're getting? Have collections started to be a bit slower and are folks looking to repair their vehicles a little bit less at this point and trying to postpone some repairs?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. The answer to this is no. I was just -- about 2 weeks ago, I was with 700 customers at the national NHRA championships in Joliet, and I didn't get to meet all 700 of course, but I got to meet quite a few of them, and they were uniformly positive. And just a couple of days ago, I was out on a van riding around the countryside stopping at garages and shops and so on. And they seemed, I would say, fairly positive and full of business. So I don't think that the grassroots level you see much out there in terms of moaning or saying, this is -- things are tough or anything like that. I don't see that. Now there's the odd person that has a problem depending on what's been happening, particularly if it's a franchisee and let's say Ford and General Motors have closed a dealership in his area, so he's re-adjusting with other stops we give him. But generally, I'm seeing fairly good positioning. Now I'll remind you that we view ourselves as recession-resistant, not immune. So what happened the last time is when the recession eventually rose people kept buying -- people kept repairing cars. The journal was running articles like economy is glum, but repair shops hum. And what happened was our customers kept buying short payback items like wrenches and hand tools, but they stopped buying big-ticket items like toolboxes, tool storage units, and we're still seeing that business robust.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "How about on the industrial side?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't think so either. We're not -- again, we operate in criticality. So generally, our customers hold on to our buys a little longer. And what I mean by operating in the space of criticality is that you're selling to someone who knows that if the machine he's or whatever he's maintenancing or whatever he's supporting has a problem, the consequences of failure are high. Therefore, he has a tremendous motivation to try to pay for the repeatability and reliability of a Snap-on level product. And so that tends to be more resilient. Now it's not unaffected by recession either, but we were up double digits in that business. And there's a lot of landscaping there. The military was flat, the government was flat, the aerospace is up, natural resource is up and it's always so. There's always landscaping, but it was pretty good. Emerging markets. People ask me about emerging markets all the time, but everybody's talking about China slowing down, and it maybe so. But if you think about this, repair business in China hasn't even started, the repair wave hasn't started. They sold more in cars in China than any place else in the world last year, but all the cars in the road are new versus -- and not many of them, 60 million, 70 million cars on the road and they're all new versus United States where there are 300 million cars on the road and the average is 11 years old. So the business hasn't even started in China, just rising. So when we look at our results, we're not a good barometer of economy there. We should be rising anyway because our sector is just rising.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The $21 million currency hit in the quarter in revenue. You've got operations set up over in Europe. Do you have your cost pretty much in line with your revenues in terms of currency impact?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, yes. The profitability impact was lower than that. So it's not -- you're looking at that $21 million is give or take -- government work is 3% impact, the profitability impact is substantially lower than that. Looking forward, you'll see. You can -- if the exchange rates stay where they are, you could be thinking about 3% again I guess. And then I think when you start to look at year-over-year, the comparisons get a little easier as you get out into other quarters.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay. So then in environment where the euro is gaining ground against the dollar, we would see more of an increase in revenue, but less of an increase in profitability?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, right. Right, sure. Sure.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "On the RCI initiatives, what kind of a cost savings run rate would you project coming out of RCI? I mean you've been doing this program for quite a while now? What would you expect in terms of the kind of magnitude of cost savings that you can continue to get from RCI?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think that's hard to say, but I think you could say $25 million, $30 million a year or something like that, those kind of numbers. I don't know. We try not to put a number on that. I kind of try to address that when I said the restructuring paybacks was 2 years in Europe.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "You count restructuring the same as RCI?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, not -- no, it's not the same. We have restructuring, but we also get RCI. They're different -- they're distinct things, but, I guess, I was trying to give you some kind of a view of the kinds and numbers we were going to get out restructuring. But you can look at that number, you can go back and look at our productivity numbers, you can see the kinds of numbers we've generated on an annual basis, on sort of flat sales, and I think you could see that going forward. Normally, how I answer this question is that people I think are -- I don't know if this is your concern is that, maybe you run out of opportunities. And I don't think we are. I think there's a lot of a -- Snap-on. Mainly because there are a lot of processes in Snap-on. A hand tool is heavily integrated if you think about it. You don't buy many components. You have a piece of steel comes in the back of the hand tool plant, the finish products goes out the output front and really, pretty much everything that goes into the hand tool is done inside the plant, you don't buy anything for it. So there's a lot of opportunities for RCI and then you have 65,000 SKUs, which creates a complex landscape. So we see a continuous run, but I hate to commit any one particular number. I know you'd like to have one for your model, but I hate to commit to that. I just say that I believe we hold ourselves to a standard that on flat sales we expect to have improvement.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "On that Masters of Metal tour, I hope you're in a rush toward a pot of sales gold at the end of a rainbow. It won't turn out to go over like a led zeppelin.", "Operator", "And that was our final question. Ms. Kratcoski, I'll turn it over back to you for closing remarks.", "Leslie H.

These improvements are facilitating our ability to increasinglycapture profitable growth opportunities which were demonstrated again thisquarter with sales up 14.5% and operating profits up almost 59%. Net sales of$681 million in the quarter were up $86 million or 14.5% over last year, withsales increases across all segments. The November 2006 acquisition of BusinessSolutions contributed 8.2 percentage points of growth, while currency contributed3.3 percentage points. The balance of our year-over-year growth is 3%, but whenyou factor out the OEM facilitation business, whose revenue comparisons areaffected by the timing of OEM programs, our organic growth across all of ourother businesses was 8.6%. As a measure of productivity improvement, sales perassociate were up 10.6% from comparable 2006 levels on a trailing 12-monthbasis. This is also up sequentially from the 9% improvement reported lastquarter. In our Financial Services segment, revenue increased 4.5 million, andoperating income improved 2.6 million due both to improved yields and lowerdiscount rates.", "Consolidatedgross profit of $301 million represented 44.2% of sales, up 70 basis pointsfrom the 43.5% earned a year ago. We incurred $5.2 million of higher materialand other manufacturing cost increases, but they were more than offset by $7million of savings from rapid continuous improvement or RCI initiatives. Higheryear-over-year LIFO related inventory costs negatively affected the comparisonsby 5.7 million. The year-ago quarter included $2.7 million of LIFO benefits,which improved last year's gross margin by 50 basis points, while this year'squarter includes $3 million of LIFO charges, which lowered the gross margin by40 basis points.", "Operatingexpenses of $234 million increased $18 million from 2006 levels. The increaseincludes Business Solutions, as well as higher selling expenses and $4.9million of unfavorable currency translation. These increases were partiallyoffset by $2.4 million", "ofgains on facility sales and 1.7 million of benefits from ongoing RCIinitiatives. Year-over-year restructuring costs were $2.1 million lower. Thecontributions from RCI are clearly eliminating waste and allowing us to betterleverage our spending. As a percent to sales, operating expenses improved from36.3% of sales last year to 34.4% this year.", "Operatingearnings of $72 million for the quarter were up almost 59% from 2006 levels,reflecting both the earnings contribution from higher sales and nearly $9million of savings and improvements from RCI initiatives. As a percentage ofrevenues, operating", "earningsimproved to 10.4%, which is up significantly from the 7.5% earned a year ago. ", "Itis important to note that on a trailing 12-month basis through September, wehave achieved an operating margin of 10.2%. We were at 7.7% for the same perioda year ago before the litigation settlement, and at 6.7% two years ago. We arepleased that we have achieved this through both cost reduction and growth.", "Interestexpense is up $7 million year-over-year as a result of higher debt levels fromthe Business Solutions acquisition. Our effective income tax rate for thequarter was 34.5% as expected. Diluted earnings per share from continuingoperations of $0.70 in the quarter were up significantly, about 49% from the$0.47 earned last year. Clearly, the improvements being made through theexecution of our core initiatives are resulting in a solid operating platformthat we believe is beginning to deliver higher levels of sustained profitablegrowth. With that as an overall summary, I will now turn to our segmentresults. Please turn to slide 5.", "Third-quartersales of $262 million for the Snap-on Tools Group were up over 7% from 2006levels. In North America,sales increased 5.4% year-over-year, largely due to the improved performance inthe U.S. In the U.S., sales improved 4.1%year-over-year,", "despitea slight decline, less than 1% in the number of franchisees. Growth includedhigher sales of mid-tier products as well as our expanded RWD product offeringtogether with improvement in sales of Snap-on branded hand tools and toolstorage. We are pleased with where we are in the execution of our corestrategies, including those relating to improving the franchise proposition.", "Internationalsales in the Tools Group also increased, with sales up over 15%. Withoutcurrency, sales were up 9.3% on continued strong sales performance, includingsignificant gains in the U.K. and Australia.", "Grossmargin trends in the Snap-on Tools Group were significantly impacted by theeffects of LIFO that I previously mentioned. At the Snap-on Tools Group level,LIFO lowered gross margin for the segment by almost 100 basis points in 2007while in 2006,", "LIFOadded 120 basis points to the gross margin. ", "Operatingearnings for the Tools Group of 24.6 million were up nearly 9 million fromprior year levels. Currency translation contributed about $800,000 of thisincrease. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings improved significantly,up 300 basis points from 6.4% of sales in 2006 to 9.4% in 2007. Year-to-datethrough September, the Tools Group has reported an operating margin of 10.6%.", "Turningto the Commercial & Industrial Group on slide 6, segment sales of $328million increased 14% over 2006 levels, 10% without currency. About half of theorganic sales growth came from our Worldwide Industrial business. Also,contributing to the increase was our European Hand Tools business, our globalEquipment business, which reported particularly strong sales gains in Europe and growth in Asia.", "Asa percentage of sales, operating expenses in the C & I group improved from28% last year to 25.7% this year, reflecting leverage on higher sales andcontributions from RCI. Operating earnings of nearly $33 million for the groupwere up over 40% year-over-year. Currency added about $900,000 to operatingincome. We did complete as planned during the quarter the migration ofproduction from one of our Swedish plants and we sold the building. The $1.4million gain on sale of the building is included in these third quarterresults.", "TheDiagnostics & Information Group is shown on slide 7. There are a number oflarge items affecting these comparisons. The acquisition of Business Solutionslast November added $48.6 million in sales. And sales of our core Diagnostic& Information products grew 10.3% in the quarter. Offsetting theseincreases, however, was a sales decline in our OEM facilitation business whichis now completing a major facilitation program in Europe. The wind down of thisprogram alone caused $22.5 million of their decline. Gross margin in the D& I group improved to 45.9% in the quarter from 37.7% a year ago,reflecting the continued shift in sales to higher margin, higher value-addedinformation products. Operating earnings of $22.2 million in the quarter wereup $6.3 million from prior year-end and as a percentage of sales improved from12.5% in 2006 to 14.6% in 2007.", "Nowlet me turn to a brief discussion of our balance sheet and cash flow. As seenon slide 8, receivables and inventory management continued to improve with dayssales outstanding and inventory turns both improving. DSO dropped to 72 daysfrom 75 days", "comparedto the same period a year ago, while inventory turns improved to 4.6 times from4.2 times. As you would expect, inventories and receivables were significantlyaffected by currency, increasing in total about $36 million from year-end. Forthe most recent 12-month period, and as adjusted for the acquisition ofBusiness Solutions in late 2006, pretax return on invested capital improvedsubstantially to 18.4% from 14.1% a year ago. Our net debt position at thirdquarter end is $435 million. Our net debt to total capital was 26.7%, down fromits high of 31.5% shortly after the Business Solutions acquisition.", "Turningto slide 9, cash flow from operating activities in the quarter remain strong at$59 million. Significantly affecting the third quarter comparisons of cashprovided by operating activities are changes in operating assets and liabilities,particularly caused by the timing of payments of accounts payable, which thisyear consumed cash of $20 million, but which a year ago provided $15 million ofcash flow. For the first nine months of 2007, we have deployed about $120million of our free cash flow to both debt reduction and shareholderdistributions, compared to about $65 million over the same period last year.This concludes my remarks on our third quarter.", "NowI would like to briefly review with you some financial considerations for thebalance of 2007. As we said in the press release and have summarized on slide10, we expect continued year-over-year operating and earnings improvements forthe remainder", "of2007. The first nine months of this year, we spent $16.5 million on restructuringinitiatives. We currently expect this full-year restructuring cost could be ashigh as $25 million, which is down from the $28 million previouslycommunicated. We continue", "toanticipate that capital spending for 2007 will be in a range of $55 million to$60 million, and that depreciation and amortization will be about $70 million.Because of higher debt levels from the acquisition of Business Solutions, weexpect to incur", "approximately$25 million of increased year-over-year interest expense. And finally, weanticipate that our effective tax rate for the quarter -- for the fourthquarter of 2007 will approximate 34.5%. Now, I would like to turn the call overto Nick. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "", "Thanks,Marty. For those following the slides, my comments are outlined beginning onslide number 12. I would say we are in -- I would say our third quarterrepresents another encouraging step on the path of improvement defined by ourstrategic initiatives. We are particularly pleased with the balance of theprogress, both volume gain and cost reduction contributed substantially to ourimprovement in this quarter. I am going to landscape that for you in theindividual groups in a minute, but before we go further, I want to -- I want torecognize that our continuing progress is the clear and direct result of ourSnap-on", "associatesaround the world. My thanks to all of you for your contributions. They havebeen extraordinary. I also believe that it is important to highlight the rolethat great product plays in our performance. Innovation has been an importantpart of Snap-on's", "strengthsince its founding. ", "Inthe past quarter, we have again seen more tangible evidence of that strength.We are extremely pleased to have received three of Motor Magazine's 2007 awardsfor innovation. They are pictured on the slide. The first is the Snap-onVariable Length Extension. It is a spring-loaded device that increasesproductivity when you are working in tight spaces. The second is the BFH 800Wheel Balancer. It uses Snap-on's unique laser-enabled systems and it createsthe fastest balance in the industry. And the third is the ETHOS, which is theunit which provides great diagnostic power to entry-level technicians. Theproducts so recognized, span a range of our operating divisions from tools toequipment to diagnostics, so we are pleased about that. At Snap-on, innovationis an essential part of our ongoing commitment to our customers and it is areally key element of our growth going forward. In that regard, we are proud ofthe recognition we consistently receive from both our -- both the industry andfrom our customers. Now, let's turn to slide number 13, to our individualoperations.", "Regardingthe Snap-on Tools Group, we continue to work both on the outside, making ourfranchise proposition better, and on the inside, improving supply chain andcreating -- and creating unique product offerings, just like the ones we justdiscussed. And in those efforts, a strong and sustainable platform forprofitable growth is being established. ", "Speakingof our franchisees, they continue to get stronger. The key health metrics forall their businesses are moving in the right direction. Van sales are growingand the franchisee turnover is declining, both very favorable indicators.Beyond that, expansion of our mid-tier and RWD initiatives are contributingsubstantially to our business. And our franchisees have recognized the benefitand have said so.", "Now,having said that, we can't lose sight of the importance of cost reduction inour COT. And on the inside when we talk about supply, we focus on somethingcalled complete and on-time order fulfillment or COT as we call it, as I justmentioned. In that", "dimension,we are sustaining our progress. On our high volume SKUs, COT is about 93%. Muchimproved from where we started and is well up from the mid-80s where we werejust two years ago. Our franchisees have seen the difference and they have benefitedfrom the progress. Now that said, we can't lose sight of our breakthrough goal,which is, after all, 99%. So, we still have much more to do and we still havesubstantial opportunity for gain. In that context, we see rapid continuousimprovement -- rapid continuous improvement process or RCI as we call it forshort. We see that process as a decisive growth enabler. To be sure, ouroperations have made substantial growth or substantial advancement in reducingcost and raising productivity with RCI. But that process has also beeneffective in improving our supply chain, making our distribution system moreefficient and our factories more flexible. And all that makes it possible forSnap-on to offer the widest range of products in the industry, providingsolutions for more customers and, of course, expanding and driving salesgrowth. So, our effort in the tool business is clearly working. The metrics sayso, and we talked with our franchisees, and they second that conclusion. But wehave more to do and more scope for improvement.", "Turningto the Commercial and Industrial Group, the operations continue to demonstrategrowth, both in existing territories and emerging markets. Strong gains thisquarter were achieved by our Industrial Division, by the European toolsoperation, and by Asia-Pacific. I think it's -- it is of particular note isthis -- is -- is the successful -- I think of particular note is the successfulramp-up of our second China plant in Kunshan. It'sdemonstrating a successful marriage of low-cost production with advanced knowhow and is ahead of schedule in producing state-of-the-art saw products for customersthroughout the region. We are also continuing the Commercial and IndustrialGroup's efforts in cost reduction. During this period, we closed the Enkoping plant.That facility had been our primary hand tool operation in Europe and its sourcing has beenredeployed to lower cost facilities and are now becoming fully engaged in cost effectivelymeeting the needs of our European customers.", "Andin the Diagnostics and Information Group, the Business Solutions acquisitioncontinues to meet expectations. As Marty pointed out, the difficult salescomparison for diagnostics in the quarter is due to the wind down of a majorOEM contract in Europe. That program involves sales to about 8,000dealers and it\u2019s nearing completion with substantially fewer deliveries in thisperiod compared to last year. But the total group's margin showed strongexpansion in the quarter which primarily reflected higher value and uniquecapabilities of our information-based products. Investments in data content andcustomer support are paying off and are paying off with increased customerretention rates for our subscriptions, to our shop management and software packagesthat provide both shop management and repair data. ", "Overallfor the corporation, the business fundamentals; safety, quality, delivery andcost are all improvements. We are recording encouraging and I have to say,repeatable achievements. Most importantly, we are seeing progress in theunderlying processes", "thatwill support more aggressive levels of profitable growth. This quarter provideda glimpse of that expansion. Our organic growth in the period excluding the OEMwind down was more than 8% and it was balanced across the corporation andseveral", "customerbases over multiple geographies.", "Webelieve strongly that Snap-on has considerable runway for increased expansionand in further improvement along several dimensions.

There may be nothing more powerful and importantfor our future success. Now, there are a number of well-known and trulysuccessful companies who have done this and their success is admirable. Now, weadmit today that we are not at those levels. In fact, since I know someone willask me I will ask and answer the question now. On a scale of 1 to 10 where 10is never achievable, where are we in our transformation? Maybe we are at 3,perhaps 3.5 and moving towards 4.

Thewheel service business in -- in automotive repair is going more toward imaging,either taking a picture -- either in alignment where you take a picture of thewheels and -- and create an alignment around that picture or profiling thetire. And Snap-on, I think, arguably is further down the learning curve inimaging technology than any other -- then any other competitor.

So, if you actually look at \u2013 and franchises -- franchises is reallythe way to think of our market coverage. This quarter was flat when it comes tofranchises \u2013 the franchisee count was down 8/10 of a point, I said less than 1%in my remarks. But in terms of market coverage and that\u2019s because we picked upmore -- more seconds. What I didn't say in my prepared remarks but should sayreally here is that the through-put, the sales through the franchisees - and wecare about both - we care about market coverage in terms of franchises, we careabout the health of the franchisees. You know, we picked up through-put interms of year-over-year growth in sales to our franchisees, a fairly strong 8%and it was roughly split in thirds around our RWD growth, which is reallymarket share gain that we are taking away from warehouse distributors, ourmid-tier sales, much of that we believe is market share gain and then still athird, over 2. 5%, coming from Snap-on and I hate to use the word core -- butyou may think about it some of our core and more historic products.", "So,that was pretty good. The reason that the U.S. reported only about 4%year-over-year growth. They had good diagnostic sales. From an accounting pointof view, we defer some of that revenue because there is some software we'lldeliver in later quarters. That revenue will come back in later quarters.

I just came back from the franchiseeconference in Canada, which had about 300people -- 300 franchisees, 300 people and 300 franchisees in conference in Calgary and I would say themood was tremendously upbeat. When we look at the -- when we look at themetrics and we see van sales up, the purchases up, and we see all the othermetrics going in the right direction and turnover down, I have to report thatit is reflected in the attitudes of our franchisees. They are dedicated andthey are optimistic about the future. They know we have more to do, but theyrecognize the improvements that have been made and they say that it's enablingthem for further advancement and having a favorable outlook on their business now.", "JamesLucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Okay.Final question, philosophical one. Jack, you talked about the -- that a -- thata system is being developed a lot more standard work, documented processes inplace.

", "JackMichaels", "", "Yeah,I think -- Jim, I think we have made improvements on all fronts, butnonetheless, I think the -- the greatest area of improvement for us going through2008 is going to be focused on productivity improvement. Now, the way wemeasure that, it is at a high level. If you get down to a cell, it's measureddifferently. But at a high level, we are looking at sales per associate and allof our business, and we are going to pay a lot more attention to that on asingle focus next year because as we do that, it will help improve ourflexibility in our plants. As Nick said, we offer more SKUs than anybody elseso we have to be able to -- you know, have great flexibility in our plants andwe are improving it but we are still not where we should be and we'll also improveon our complete on-time deliveries and therefore our sales. So you understandit very well. So I think we are going -- we are going to put a lot of attentionon just productivity for next year, and as we did in our safety program, wejust focused on one element of it, which was our incident rate, and we madegreat improvements and went from a 13 incident rate level down to 3 -- below 3,almost 2. That may not mean much too many of you but that's an OSHAcalculation, and but it shows what we can do when we really get focused and weput process steps in place and realize results. So that's exactly what we arein the process of doing. Now, we want to carry it a little larger. You know,some of the well-known competitors that we have for one, for example, you knowwho we are talking about, have done a great job with their business system. Andso we believe we have moved far enough that we can start thinking of that, andwe will be developing that.

We are still looking at some projects that may ormay not happen this year. If they happen may be up to the $25 million range ifnot we will be lower.

(Operator Instructions)  As a reminder this call is being recorded and I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Marty Ellen, Chief Financial Officer.  You may begin your conference.", "Martin M. Ellen", "Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-On\u2019s 2007 fourth quarter results.  By now you should have seen our press release issued last evening.  As you\u2019ve seen, this was a record quarter and full year. We believe this quarter further demonstrates the achievements we\u2019ve made in many of our core operating and growth initiatives.  We\u2019ll discuss these with you today.  Joining me is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-On\u2019s President and CEO, along with Jack Michaels, Snap-On\u2019s Chairman.  Nick will kick off our call this morning with some perspective on our operating results.  I will then provide a review of our financial results. Afterwards we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion.

This call is copyrighted material by Snap-On Incorporated.  It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience, therefore, it cannot be recorded, transcribed, or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-On\u2019s express permission. ", "With that I will now turn the call over to Nick.  Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Thanks, Marty.  For those of you following the slides, I\u2019m starting on slide number 5.  In my view, the past quarter and in fact this past year have been quite encouraging.  Q4 sales were $743 million and that\u2019s up over 14%.  Full year sales were more than 2.8 billion and that\u2019s up over 15%.  The earnings per share in the fourth quarter of $0.98 is represents well over a 40% increase depending on how you look at the comparison and the full year is $3.23.  It was record quarter, it was a record year.  I was pretty encouraged.", "When we look back at it though from a distance, we\u2019d like to characterize it as another step forward on what\u2019s becoming for Snap-On a reasonably well-defined and repeatable path of improvement.  We see that path laid out before us. Sales gains, heightened productivity, cost reduction, margin expansion, they were all in abundant evidence in the operating results of the fourth quarter and it\u2019s that particular progress and each of those areas that contributed pretty significantly to the record earnings for both the quarter and the full year.", "If you want to look at it from another perspective, the fourth quarter\u2019s clearly demonstrative of the corporation\u2019s diversity from our broad, wise, and expanding global presence, from our diverse professional and industrial customer base, our extensive product line, our well-recognized brands, our legendary service, and some pretty strong group of associates.  ", "All of that, we believe, has us well positioned in some pretty key market segments.  I think at this point, at least in this environment, it\u2019s worth noting that the primary drive of our business is the professional vehicle repair sector.  That\u2019s an area particularly resilient in most economies.  We also benefit from significant activities in a broad range of industries, good industries like aerospace, energy, natural resources, military, education, and agriculture, industries that follow a quite diverse set of macro economic drivers.  Finally, Snap-On is an increasingly global corporation with growing revenues outside of North America.  In fact, fourth quarter revenues outside of the US were 45% of our total, and a full 6% were from the emerging markets of Asia Pacific.  So we\u2019re increasingly able to take advantage of the rising economic tide that provided offset for other places which have weaknesses.  So all of that breadth from our perspective, all of that diversification, created our fourth quarter results, and we expect it to serve us well as we go forward.  ", "I\u2019m going to discuss the individual operations shortly but I want to take a moment to thank all of our Snap-On associates.  Their extraordinary contributions authored this recent success.  I know that our fourth quarter would not have been possible without your individual and collective efforts.  It was quite extraordinary.  Congratulations, and thanks.", "With that said, let\u2019s discuss some of the specific operating results and we start this on slide 6.  The commercial industrial group, that group which I know well, has a diverse geographic base and they focus on the needs of professional users in a wide range of industries and they\u2019re continuing to deliver strong sales and margin gains. Double digit sales were recorded again in our industrial division, in our European equipment division, and in our Asia Pacific operation.  In fact, the industrial division keeps rolling.  Their sales were over 20% increased year-over-year.  They seem to be developing substantial record of quarter after quarter of improvement.  So when we look at C&I, and I think we\u2019ve said on these calls, we\u2019re pretty confident that C&I has considerable runway.  It showed again in the fourth quarter.  For that matter, we\u2019re making pretty good progress in our efforts pretty much across the corporation to develop a strong and sustainable platform for profitable growth.  At other calls we\u2019ve talked about the idea that moving forward we wanted to create a balance between cost reduction and growth.  Previous quarters we had made our numbers through cost reduction.  Now we\u2019re starting to see our strategies of growth come to fruition and see some pretty good and strong growth contributing to this record fourth quarter and we\u2019re seeing the growth of those platforms across the entire company.  ", "We\u2019re particularly pleased with the progress made at the tools group in terms of the physicals.  This month, this quarter, we experienced a sequential increase in the average number of [inaudible].  Now that\u2019s the first increase quarter over quarter that we\u2019ve seen in many quarters, more than 2 years, so we\u2019ve been working diligently to filly open routes and to reduce the turnover and that seems to be coming to fruition now.  We expect it to keep pushing that number as we go forward.  Sales per franchisees were up both for the quarter and for the full year and they included some pretty encouraging gains in our mid tier product line and our regional warehouse distribution program, our RWD program.  The mid tier in RWD initiatives you might remember, we wanted to introduce to contribute to our growth because we felt they would allow us to capture new customers that are doing that, allow us to expand sales to our traditional customers who maybe buying some mid tier products somewhere else, they\u2019re doing that, and the result of this is we\u2019ve taken back some share from some industrial distributors that encroached on our territory on the past.  ", "Outside the US for the tools business in places like the UK and Australia and Japan, sales moved pretty well.  In fact, in the quarter, sales were increased 19% year-over-year in those jurisdictions, and I think that\u2019s further evidence of the power of global reach.  So looking at the tools business, with higher per-franchisee sales with sequential increase in the number of vans, with lower franchisee turnover, and a number of other metrics which we look at on a monthly basis, the franchisees are clearly moving in the right direction and that network\u2019s getting healthier.  The numbers reinforce that positive view.  ", "Some time ago we stepped back and said the van business in an extraordinary business.  We see some opportunities and we need to make it better and the things we initiated in that time seem to be working.  Our operating results, the financials say so, the health metrics of the franchisees say so, and when I go out and talk to the franchisees, which I do quite regularly, they second that conclusion.  So we believe we\u2019re on the right track.  We\u2019re going to stay this course with the van business and we\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to lead to continued improvement with the tools group.  ", "Let\u2019s talk about diagnostics and information. We\u2019ve been investing for some time in data content and customer support and that has resulted in increased customer retention rates for products like our shop management software.  Not coincidentally, Mitchell 1, our business which sells that software, had a very strong year.  Our business solution acquisition.  While we had that, we made that, in the fourth quarter last year, in fact, I think we had about 5 weeks worth of results in the fourth quarter last year associated with Business Solutions, so the year-over-year comparisons are kind of mixed, but that acquisition is continuing to meet our expectations both from its existing business from its business itself and from the synergy that we expected from it throughout the corporation.  ", "Now the D&I group did continue to face some headwinds because we\u2019ve got two big programs in the OEM facilitation and special tools business which are winding down, and they created a lot of substantially unfavorable year-over-year comparison in that particular division, but overall the group which includes Business Solutions diagnostics and Mitchell and that OEM business, had a very strong quarter.  ", "Now let\u2019s turn to slide 7, looking inward a little bit.  Innovation\u2019s always been the core of our business at Snap-On and we\u2019ve been trying to work recently to make sure that gets better, gets stronger.  We\u2019re looking at the innovation process to get more ideas in earlier in development so we sift through more ideas and generate more products.  We\u2019re taking technical tools and promulgating them and moving them through the corporation, things like finite element analysis and dynamic simulation analysis and Wibel analysis, and all of that is resulting in a good strong stream of innovative new products.  I talked last quarter about Motor magazine citing 3 Snap-On tools as among the best tools of 2007.  In fact we\u2019ve got more of those awards than any other manufacturer.  While we have another stream of that, in fact we keep turning out the new tools, things like the Dual 80 ratchet, powered by micro gears, and stronger and more easier to use than any other ratchet in the system.  The Court 4850 18 volt cordless power tool with the reduced package, more power, 600 foot pounds and it can get in places which no other cordless took can get in.  The new SOLUS pro from diagnostics which puts more diagnostic intelligence in the hands of the technician and solves problems faster.  The electronics parts catalog, the new GM electronic parts catalog from Snap-On Business Solutions which is sold in 97 countries and is available in 26 languages and the Bahco one-handed pruning tool which cuts faster and allows the user to get in places where other cutters cannot, all of these are being received well by our professional customer case.  They drove part of the growth in the fourth quarter and they\u2019re going to continue to do so.  We have the processes behind these.  We have the skills in our associate capabilities.  We expect the stream of products to keep moving us forward and helping us grow in that regard.", "Now also looking inward, if we look at the supply chain, we\u2019re continuing to focus on complete and on time order fulfillment. In that regard we\u2019re achieving I think continuing progress and that\u2019s being achieved by the rapid continuous improvement or what we call RCI, our version of lean.  It\u2019s proven to be pretty effective in a lot of different places but with supply chain it is improve the supply chain, it\u2019s made our distribution system more effective, and it\u2019s making our factories more flexible.  But it\u2019s not been just limited to supply chain, it\u2019s had its effect throughout the organization and RCI has allowed us to improve quality, delivery, cost, and raise productivity, and when you do that, you provide more throughput and you provide more capacity and productivity.  Coming back to COT though, particularly in North America, it had been a problem over time.  A year ago our complete and on time for our key products was 88%.  I\u2019m happy to report in the fourth quarter it approached 94%, and when I talk to our customers, they\u2019ve seen the difference, they\u2019ve benefited from that progress.  We\u2019re going to keep moving in that direction.  We have to because in fact our 2007 could have been better.  We disappointed a substantial number of customers because we sold out our capacity.  Now that\u2019s our capacity at current efficiency levels for capacity for several of our products, for major product lines.  Some pieces of our major product lines and hand tools and saws and power tools and tools storage.  Product lines, products, and all those areas were oversubscribed from time to time, so RCI and Select Capital Investment, that\u2019ll remedy that as we go forward.  We believe we clearly have more run way and we\u2019re going to work pretty hard to use it. ", "So overall, we\u2019re seeing considerable and steady progress in our business fundamentals.  I think you\u2019ve seen that from us for quarter after quarter, but beyond that you\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter t hat Snap-On has -- and I think a few quarters before that -- Snap-On has substantial opportunity for further growth, and that\u2019s based on the diversity of our global footprint, the breadth of our customer base, our effective  RCI that\u2019s going to give us more capacity, our wide product offerings, our legendary brand, all of that has us well positioned for the future.  From my perspective we truly had an encouraging quarter and we had an encouraging year.  It reflected first the historical strength of the Snap-On company.  It reflected the capabilities and skills we\u2019ve added recently, and it reflected the quarters of growth we\u2019ve opened up over the past few years.  In that regard I\u2019d like to take the opportunity right now to express my personal thanks and appreciation to Jack Michaels, our Chairman and recently retired CEO.  His insightful counsel and guidance over the past years were invaluable and it\u2019s clear as a result of Jack\u2019s leadership that Snap-On is positioned and well positioned to deliver the most valued productivity solutions in the world.  We did just that in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward.  ", "Now I want to turn the call back over to Marty.", "Martin M. Ellen ", "Thanks, Nick.  Turning to slide 9, net sales of $743 million in the quarter were up $92 million or 14%. Sales increases occurred across all segments.  Business Solutions which was acquired in November 2006 had 5 weeks of operating results last year.  The incremental Business Solutions sales in 2007 contributed 4.8 percentage points of growth.  Currency translation also contributed 4.8 percentage points of the reported sales increase.  Factoring out for you as we did last quarter the impact of our OEM facilitation business, those revenue comparisons are affected by the timing of OEM programs.  Our organic sales growth across all of our other businesses was 6%.  As a measure of productivity improvement, sales per associate were up 11.3% from comparable 2006 levels, further evidence of the results of our RCI initiatives.  ", "In our financial services segment, revenue increased $4.2 million and operating income improved $3 million, reflecting higher net spreads mostly due to lowered discount rates.  Consolidated gross profit of $333 million was 44.9% of sales up 150 basis points from a year ago.  Most of this gross margin rate improvement is due to [LIFO] inventory valuation which added $6 million of benefit in this year\u2019s fourth quarter versus a charge of $4.1 million a year ago. On a FIFO basis, gross margins were 44.1% this year compared to 44% last year.  Material and other manufacturing cost increases of $7.4 million in the quarter were more than offset by $12.6 million of savings form our ongoing RCI initiatives.  ", "Operating expenses of $245 million in the quarter increased $16 million from 2006 levels, including nearly $10 million of incremental operating expenses for Business Solutions.  Currency translation added $8 million to reported operating expenses and restructuring costs increased by $3.8 million.  These increases were partially offset by a $4 million gain from the sale of a building in Europe.  $1.9 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives, and $1.7 million of lower spending in 2007 on the tools group strategic initiatives.  We discussed those initiatives with you last year.  As a percentage of sales, operating expenses were 33% in the quarter and improved 220 basis points from 2006.  ", "Operating earnings of $96 million for the quarter were up 64% from 2006 levels.  As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings improved to 12.6%, up significantly from the 8.8% earned a year ago, and for the full year, we achieved an operating margin of 11.2% which compares with 8% in 2006 excluding the litigation settlement last year and compares with 7% back in 2005.  We\u2019re pleased with these improvements in profitability were achieved through a combination of both sales growth and margin expansion.  Interest expense is up $4.5 million year-over-year as a result of higher debt levels from the Business Solutions acquisition.  ", "Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.2% as compared to 28.5% last year.  The effective tax rate in the quarter was lower than our prior estimate of 34.5% principally as a result of a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and rate reductions in several foreign jurisdictions.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.98 in the quarter were up significantly, about 56% from the $0.63 earned last year.  Clearly the improvements being made through the execution of our core initiatives are resulting in a solid operating platform that is delivering higher levels of earnings for our shareholders. ", "With that as an overall summary I will now turn to our segment results.  Starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide 10, segment sales of $369 million in the quarter increased 16% over 2006 levels and were up 9.5% without currency.  About two-thirds of the organic sales growth came from our worldwide industrial business.  Also contributing to the increase was our European equipment ad professional hand tools businesses along with continued strong sales growth in Asia.  Fourth quarter operating earnings of $38 million for the C&I group were up 18.6% year-over-year on higher sales and ongoing contributions from RCI.  While the reported operating margin of 10.3% was up only slightly from the 10.1% earned last year, you should note that this year\u2019s fourth quarter included $8.8 million of restructuring costs compared to last year\u2019s $4.1 million.  This year\u2019s fourth quarter also included a $4 million building gain.  This resulted from the sale of a facility in Europe as we continue our manufacturing foot print migration to lower cost regions.  Absent these items, this year\u2019s operating margin in the quarter would have been 11.6% for the C&I group.  ", "Turing now to slide 11, Snap-On Tools Group had fourth quarter sales of $273 million, up nearly 4.5% from 2006 levels.  In North America sales increased 1% year-over-year.  In the US, franchisee count was flat and vans were down 1.6% as we continued to see runoff in the second van program.  Importantly, however, the number of franchisees and the number of vans increased sequentially from third quarter levels and we expect continued sequential increases in 2008.  International sales in the tools group increased over 19%. Excluding currency, sales were up 11.2%, a continued strong sales performance in the UK and higher gains in Japan.  Most of the improvement in the UK was from higher sales of tool storage and diagnostics, and in the UK we were named 2007 Franchiser Of The Year by the British Franchise Association, again demonstrating the strength and innovative nature of our franchise business model.", "Fourth quarter operating earnings for the tools group of $36.5 million were up over $21 million from last year.  As I mentioned earlier, 10.1 million of this improvement was due to year-over-year LIFO comparisons.  Operating earnings in 2007 benefited from 4.1 million of savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.  Operating earnings also benefited from our franchise and supply chain improvements including $1.7 million of lower costs in 12007 related to the successful completion of certain of these initiatives. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to the diagnostics and information group which is shown on slide 12.  Fourth quarter sales in the D&I group increased over $29 million or 21% from 2006 levels.  Business Solutions added $31 million in sales for the quarter.  Our hand held diagnostics, software, and information businesses grew $7 million or 11%.  The negative comparison was in our OEM facilitation business which as expected is completing a contract with a major OEM in Europe.  Gross margin in the D&I group improved to 44.7% in the quarter from 42.1% a year ago reflecting the continued shift in sales to higher margin, higher value added information products.  ", "Operating earnings of $27.4 million in the quarter were up 6.7 million from prior year, including 2.6 million from ongoing RCI initiatives.  As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the D&I group improved 140 basis points from 14.8% of sales in 2006 to 16.2% of sales in 2007.", "Now let me turn to a brief discussion of our balance sheet and cash flow.  As seen on slide 13, we continued to improve receivables and inventory management.  Days sales outstanding dropped to 73 days from 76 days compared to the same period a year ago.  While inventory turns improved to 4.9 times from 4.6 last year.  As you\u2019d expect, the dollar values of inventories and receivables were significantly affected by currency, increasing in total about $40 million from year end 2006.  Our net debt position at year end is $425 million.  Our net debt to total capital was 24.8% which is down from its high of 31.5% shortly after the Business Solutions acquisition. ", "Turning to slide 14, cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was about $54 million and free cash flow was $35.5 million.  For the full year 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $231 million.  Free cash flow was $169 million.  Free cash flow for the year was reduced by $44 million of which $24 million occurred in the fourth quarter principally resulting from litigation settlement payments and contributions to fund a portion of our post-retirement healthcare liabilities.  As we planned, capital expenditures for the year of almost $62 million were up from $51 million last year due to higher investments to improve manufacturing flow and flexibility and to support our strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives including expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in lower cost regions.  ", "In 2007 we made $120 million of shareholder distributions.  This is net of proceeds received on shares issued under stock option and purchase plans and includes our quarterly dividend which was raised last quarter by 11% to $0.30 per share.  ", "This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance.  Now I\u2019d like to briefly review with you some financial considerations for 2008 as shown on slide 15.  With respect to 2008, we expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives including further investments in Asia and other global emerging markets to further expand worldwide sourcing, manufacturing, and sales.  Snap-On also expects to continue implementing it\u2019s other strategic and RCI initiatives intended to provide higher levels of growth and profitability.  Snap-On anticipates 2008 restructuring costs to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million, down from the $26 million incurred in 2007.  ", "Capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million.  Snap-On also expects that its 2008 effective income tax rate will approximate 33%.  As a result, Snap-On expects full year 2008 sales and operating earnings to improve over 2007 levels.  ", "Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some closing thoughts. Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "As I said earlier in my comments, the fourth quarter in particular and the year 2007 in general were quite encouraging.  The results I think provide testimony that the path we\u2019re taking extending our C&I business down the runway we see there, taking full advantage of the terrific business model we have in the van channel, integrating business solutions, building our software portfolio, driving innovation, and continuing to improve and working RCI, it seems to be working, it seems to be succeeding, and it\u2019s delivering a trend now for a number of quarters of achievement, but I suppose the question on the mind of most people is what about the environment?  ", "In the near term it\u2019s likely that economic winds will be some challenge, but there are always challenges in business and if you look at the first quarter we\u2019ve managed well so far and we\u2019re pretty confident that we can manage going forward, and that\u2019s because our businesses are positioned in favorable sectors.  Our activities are spread among multiple industries all over, over many geographies.  Our strategies we\u2019re pretty sure are sound.  Our competitive position has never been stronger and our operating capabilities and our skills are improving.  We can see it every day.  So that\u2019s why we\u2019re optimistic.  We\u2019re optimistic about continuing our trend of improvement through 2008 and beyond.  We feel pretty good about the position we have.

(Operator Instructions) We will proceed in the order that you signal us and we\u2019ll take as many questions as time permits.  We\u2019ll pause for a moment to assemble our roster.", "We\u2019ll go first to Alexander Paris with Barrington Research Associates.  ", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "Good quarter.  Just a couple of quick questions here.  You mentioned 6% of sales in the fourth quarter are from Asia Pacific.  You are not including Japan and Australia in that?  These were just the emerging countries, right?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "No, no, I was including everything, which makes the base, I was including Japan in that.  ", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "So that\u2019s only 6% of in Japan --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Japan is about a $50 million business I think and our businesses in Asia Pacific and what you would call the emerging markets I think in the full year are about $83 million.  ", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "For example, India and China are fast growing areas.  Are they amenable to van distributions?  Do the mechanics own their own tools?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Unlikely, no.  The mechanics do not own their own tools in that area, so they\u2019re not I guess fertile ground for the van channel as we know it.  They are grounds though for vans used in things like demonstration vans where you can develop businesses.  The model that would be deployed in places like in India and China would be more like the model we deployed with Bahco, and we do deploy a van model primarily in distribution around Japan where technicians don\u2019t own their own tools.  So what we see developing in India and China are a variety of distribution channels.  One would be direct for bigger customers, two would be through distributors, and we\u2019re building a growing number of distributors, that\u2019s what\u2019s been successful for us in Europe, and then in selected places demonstration vans, but you won\u2019t see it the way you saw it and the way we see it in the United States because the technicians do not own their own tools.  We still feel pretty positive about the prospects of expanding in that area.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "Yeah, they\u2019re making more and more cars.  ", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "The cars and the car parts are growing substantially.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "Speaking of the domestic van business that in North America, the 1% growth, that\u2019s under the market growth.  I\u2019m just wondering, your dealers may be reducing some of their inventory just in the face of the economic environment or what?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "We have a lot of variation, I will talk to you about the sales change for the franchisee improvement year-over-year.  We tend to get a lot of variation from quarter to quarter so we don\u2019t put much stock in a particular quarter.  The four quarters of this year were something like 5% growth, 1% growth, 7% growth, and 1% growth this year.  So we see a lot of variation.  I will tell you this, that we have a kick off that comes every January for the year by region.  Chicago had one, Phoenix had one.  Marty, by the way, went to the Phoenix kick off, I went to the Chicago kick off.  There\u2019s something wrong with that picture I might add.  But in that kick off, our franchisees order and they ordered a record amount of product this time.  So we feel pretty positive.  The 1% doesn\u2019t bother us at all. Of course we always remain vigilant. We read the paper and we\u2019re watching everything, but in fact, based on the kick off, we feel pretty good about our position.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "Just one more quick question and then I\u2019ll get off, I\u2019m sorry.  There\u2019s a huge momentum that you have.  You keep reading the forecast which is great and it\u2019s longer term.  It can\u2019t continue.  Where are you in times of say RCI opportunities?  A quarter way through?  Half, three quarters and when it settles down a little bit more, given all the changes you\u2019ve made, what would you say your longer term, say 3 to 5 year, growth that you would be expecting or hoping for in terms of top line --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "That\u2019s a several part question.  This is the famous Jack Michaels answer to the RCI question and he usually says 3 to 4 and I am not contradicting him about that.  I can tell you that everywhere we go in the organization, we can see abundant opportunity for RCI improvement, and by that I mean obvious things that can be improved and done better.  RCI had quite a bit of improvement in 2007 so we feel pretty strongly that we can continue that going forward.  Now in terms of our growth and profitability going forward, I think Marty had said here for 2010 in terms of operating income we\u2019re targeting a middish double digit number, I don\u2019t know exactly where that word came from, but middish double digit number by 2010, and I think you can expect us to target growing between 5% and 10% -- mid single digits in sales and try to get mid double digits in profit moving forward.  That\u2019s the kind of thing we do.", "Martin M. Ellen ", "Alex, it\u2019s Marty and we\u2019ve talked in the past about a model that out to 2010 when we first looked at that as a planning horizon a year or so ago that we thought  we could expand operating margins to about 13% and we previously acknowledged that given where we are today, we\u2019re probably ahead of where we thought we would be at this point and now believe we could probably take that 13% up by 2010 to say mid double digits.  We think there\u2019s that kind of market expansion, the business, we\u2019re comfortable with the organic growth in the mid single digits but as we\u2019ve said and people have asked on the margin expansion side where we think it is and we\u2019ve said in the past we thought we had a lot of opportunity in SG&A and I think you\u2019re seeing some of that come through in the numbers we\u2019re now reporting.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates ", "Again, thanks very much. Sorry for too many questions. Great quarter.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Steven Nissan with Mindflow Capital Investments.  ", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Thanks a lot, guys.  First of all Jack, congratulations on the outstanding tenure with Snap-On and continued success in your future endeavors.  A couple of things, Nick, that piqued my attention.  You guys obviously had an outstanding Rapid Continuous Improvement program in place.  What metrics are you guys using with the [inaudible] so as to measure success in terms of like OEE, RONA, some of those are the bigger metrics out there with [inaudible].  Are you using those types of metrics?  And also, have you guys given yourself visibility into root causes of failures with your production process, and what are you doing to catch those root causes at the time to make the necessary adjustments to improve on [inaudible]?", "Well, you know, first thing, let me just say that we try to, that\u2019s a big question.  Let me just say that we order the business fundamentals in this way: safety, quality, delivery, and cost.  So we have measurements along each of those categories.  I talked a little bit about delivery with complete non time so that\u2019s one of the things where we measure our effectiveness in RCI.  The 88% going to 94% is a good example of that.  We do track in terms of cost we track the productivity on a sales per head count basis and of course there\u2019s the macro which is the RONA bit number which encompasses everything.  We look at those two things.  In terms of safety, we have incident rates which we track on a biweekly basis at the corporate level, so those are the big things.  In terms of quality it tends to break down more product by product and plant by plant because there\u2019s a lot of variations on how to measure that product activity, and I will tell you that Snap-On has had great record in terms of quality but Jack and I have talked about this when he was there and we have more to do in terms of measuring quality in each of our plants.  Right now what we do is we measure at the plant level.  We have non-parallel activities in terms of looking at reject rates and measuring them carefully, understanding the P charge to the statistical process analysis and trying to catch everything in the plant. What we don\u2019t do is have the customer feedback as well as we might and we\u2019re going to be putting that in place over 2007.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Do you think you guys have your vis a vi in control to where you\u2019re able to catch failures before they actually --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Absolutely in the plants.  Absolutely.  What I\u2019m not satisfied with and what we need to do a lot more work on is what happens in the field after it\u2019s been there for a while.  We do catch infant mortality.  Our product is quite durable so we don\u2019t have a lot of data coming back from the field but we don\u2019t have the mechanisms in place to monitor that should we have a problem.  ", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "What systems are you going to be putting in place to keep accelerating these outstanding RCI initiatives that you have in place?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be doing anything greatly different. Each of our activities of a certain size and most of them I think it\u2019s more than 100 people has a full time RCI coordinator.  We study at the feet of probably the world\u2019s expert shin jujitsu, the people who put the Toyota production system in place in Japan, we have them in our plants regularly.  We have our people train under them and we keep pushing that envelope to try to make sure we keep expanding and improving the continuous improvement.  So you have people in place who are professionals, you have the shin jujitsu who is there leading specific events, and you have a whole bunch of other events that are not outside led, consultant led, but are led by the internal people that are driving his.  Then one final thing, is every year, we think this is pretty important, every year we bring together the best teams who have done the most outstanding job, made the biggest impact on their operations. We bring them to a central site and we celebrate their success.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Kind of like a president\u2019s club in a way.", "Yeah, we call it the RCI conference.  We\u2019re going to have it I think in February coming up here and what happens is they come to the meeting, they make a presentation, they display their event, and they have a celebratory dinner recognizing them.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "So is that usually the top person from each plant or...?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "No, we bring like the team from each plant, so we bring 5 people from Portugal that have never been outside of Portugal, to the United States.  Some of this, this celebration, is an important piece of it.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Regarding [through put], are there still any plants that concern you in terms of metrics they are not achieving or how is that going or are you pretty satisfied with all your plants\u2019 productivity?  Are there certain areas of the country or world that are still not achieving [through put]?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "I can tell you this.  I\u2019m satisfied with none of my plants.  We\u2019re not satisfied at all.  We are happier with some of them, but we are unsatisfied with all of them.", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Final question, you\u2019ve been on board for about a month.  Obviously --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "I\u2019ve actually been here for a little --", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "I mean, as CEO, but you\u2019ve been present CEO for quite some time, and in your new title you\u2019ve been on board for a little while and 2008 is going to be very challenging for a lot, a lot of it can be out there in the factory, what\u2019s going to be your number one goal to accomplish for your full year as CEO that you want to tell the shareholders, \u201cI\u2019m the right man for the job and this is how I\u2019m going to prove shareholder value.\u201d", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Wow, we\u2019re going to continue... Well first of all, I want to stop for a minute.  We are not similar to many companies in this sector.  I think there\u2019s an important point.  We are deeply routed in the vehicle repair sector.  Repair metrics, spending in the United States on vehicle repair are going up 4.6% year-over-year, and it\u2019s been steady.  The car park is growing at 2% a year, but it\u2019s aging fast every year.  It\u2019s aged every year since 1960.  39% of the cars are over 10 years old, no, 39% of the cars are over 10 years old and over half of them are off of warranty.  So vehicle repair is a very resilient business to be in.  We\u2019re not like most people or most of the companies we get lumped in with.  Now if you\u2019re going to talk about our particular next year, we want to maintain the balance of growth and continuous improvement.  That\u2019s what I believe we can deliver to shareholders.  We have ample opportunity for continuous improvement.  We\u2019re going to keep that up and we have runway for growth, and vehicle repair and in industrial business and in the emerging market.  In the vehicle repair business you could look at vans and say, \u201cWell that business might be affected.\u201d  We don\u2019t think the underlying economics will be affected and there\u2019s one other thing that\u2019s important.  About 10% of our van routes are now open.  We can fill those routes, regardless of the economy.  There are 1.3 million technicians in North America.  We only access at our complete network today 850,000.  We can access the remainder.  So we have a lot more runway, I think under any circumstances, just a matter of unlocking it.  So the balance is what I\u2019m looking for to deliver to shareholders.  ", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "I think with the big jump in the stock price today shareholders are firmly behind you and believe you are the right man for the job.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Thank you. ", "Steven Nissan - Mindflow Capital Investments ", "Good luck in 2008.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jonathan Steinmetz with Morgan Stanley. ", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Good morning, everyone.  A few questions here.  Just very near term oriented.  You guys, if I remember correctly, have a fairly tough sales comparison in the first quarter.  I think there was some blue point sort of channel fill in the first quarter of last year.  If we pull out currency, do you think you can continue to grow at sort of this mid-single digit rate or does the comparison make that difficult to start the year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Comparison makes it more difficult but we feel pretty good about our opportunities to keep our momentum going.  I think we\u2019re not backing off our idea that we\u2019re going to grow mid-single digits.  Because we have a lot of opportunities.  As I said, the industrial business, we don\u2019t want to ignore that.  Grew at 23% in the last quarter.  That\u2019s continuing.  I just got back from a conference with 500 of those industrial salesmen and they were pretty robust.  As I said, I went to the kick off meeting and they did order a record number, amount of  product, but I can tell you talking to, and I was at the Chicago meeting so it\u2019s one region, but Marty would I think testify the Phoenix region was similar.  Most of the dealers or the franchisees in that situation were very robust, very positive.  Now sometimes when you go to events like this they\u2019re revved up, you know, and they get excited and they become positive, but their numbers back it up.  So we feel pretty good about this.", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay.  Marty, and I have missed this, but if you could talk a little bit from the financial services side.  Do you have any credit metrics you can share on delinquency trends or charge offs there?  We get asked a lot given what\u2019s going on from a sub prime perspective as you can imagine and a credit perspective.  Any numbers you can share there about trends?", "Martin M. Ellen ", "Yes.  First of all, I think as many of you know, we\u2019ve been in this called sub-prime lending business for a long, long time and our model is pretty unique because our underwriting standards are pretty disciplined and we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that while we think about our 3,000 or so franchisees as selling Snap-On product, there are also 3,000 people collecting at each customer\u2019s place of business on a weekly basis.  The delinquency trends in the portfolio are actually still at reasonably historically low levels.  Now they have ticked up a little bit but what\u2019s interesting is that a little bit of tick up in a 30 plus category doesn\u2019t really show itself in 60 days so could that be a sign of some slow payments, yes, but nothing that\u2019s causing us concern when we look at the level of these numbers.", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, and you don\u2019t think availability of credit is sort of constraining anyone from either sales or for anyone getting off the ground? ", "Martin M. Ellen ", "In terms of our sales?", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Yes.", "Martin M. Ellen ", "No, I mean, we have defined credit programs and we offer those to our franchisees to offer them to their customers and as I said, these are products we\u2019ve offered them for a long time in the market place.  You should know that our franchisees actually, their delinquencies for their customers exceed certain defined levels.  It\u2019s actually a little punitive for them, so it\u2019s really incumbent upon them if they want to continue to use finance as an aid to enhance their sales that they really pay attention to collections.  Collections both in terms of ECs and really collections of their own RA books as we call them is really the fundamental piece of the model and I\u2019ll echo what Nick said coming out of Phoenix and these meetings were the middle of January so the data is relatively new.  Most of the franchisees were optimistic about their businesses and interestingly, notwithstanding what I just said about the little bit of tick in the EC portfolio, collections in January they say are pretty good, they\u2019re actually up on a per-franchisee basis.  So far we would say so good.", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay if you guys could talk a little bit about priorities in terms of use of excess cash post the dividend payment.  Any holes you want to plug, it\u2019s been a little while now since you did the Business Solutions acquisition.  Anything in that sort of $100 million, $150 million acquisition type range from a strategic perspective where you could redeploy some excess cash and plug a hole.", "Martin M. Ellen ", "Sure.  We certainly are for some period now, Jack used the phrase, some of our businesses have earned the right to grow.  Certainly we\u2019re looking at Asia Pacific. Everybody would want to grow in Asia Pacific. We have a number of businesses in the C&I group and the D&I group which we want to look at acquisitions and we have a process by which we\u2019re vetting through possible candidates.  So I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to make an acquisition but we are constantly looking at that and it wouldn\u2019t be a huge upset if down the line we made an acquisition that did plug a hole.  It could be in any of our businesses because we have quite a few opportunities in emerging markets and industrial.  ", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Where from a product, I understand the geographic type nature, where from a product perspective just sort of category wise, where would you see something like that?", "Martin M. Ellen ", "Well certainly we\u2019d see something in the diagnostic area which would be quite attractive in that area.  You would feel that that would give you some possibilities.  There are a number of geographic plays in terms of positioning, buying share and buying capability to produce any number of products in a number of different geographies like in Eastern Europe or in Asia Pacific, so that would be a situation, and then in our industrial businesses, we have industrial customers that trust us. They like the Snap-On brand.  We have generated quite a bit of growth by packaging other products with our Snap-On products and kits and mobile tool cribs and you can see us make an acquisition to add product lines in that area. ", "Jonathan Steinmetz - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan McClane with Janney, Montgomery, and Scott.", "Ryan McClane - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Good morning.  You\u2019ve spoken a little bit about the dealer network in terms of expanding total number of franchisees but I was wondering if you could kind of take it a little step further and just talk about your growth plans in general within that segment for 2008.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Well, our growth plans in that area would be of course first and foremost I talked about the filling the open routes.  I\u2019m also talking about, I mentioned in my comments, about mid tier and the RWD, the Regional Warehouse Distribution program.  Because we call on customers today who we know buy lower priced product.  They buy Snap-On products, but they buy lower priced product from other vendors like Craftsman and so on, and so the mid tier product kind of soaks up some of that business.  We also know that our people, our franchisees are calling on garages and walking by technicians because they know those technicians don\u2019t buy the Snap-On product and we have something else to sell them in the mid tier, that gives them something to sell those technicians.  Sell them mid tier and then move them up into the Snap-On product eventually.  So you see those activities, and I think those are the major things and one other thing in terms of what we\u2019ve seen for a long time is that our franchisees do occasionally sell other brands of products, other brands of power tools, other brands of some of our peripheral products, other brands of torque wrenches, to name two products and as you see our product line get stronger, I mentioned the CT 4850, you\u2019re going to see us absorb some of that.  So I guess you can look at our growth initiatives for the van channel in three pieces: one, fill the open routes.  That\u2019s an easy one.  We have customers who love us, we\u2019re not seeing them.  Two, we have places we call on where people are buying other products and they can be our customers, we\u2019ll sell them the mid tier.  Three, we have people who are buying other branded products and products we don\u2019t supply.  We have new products that will push them out and capture some of that business back and I think fourth, I guess, the RWD where some of our franchisees have from time to time been going to independent distributors and now that we offer a wide range of products through our own independent wholesale distributor, they\u2019ll buy through that, and we\u2019re seeing that activity occur in the fourth quarter. ", "", "Ryan McClane - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.  The other thing I wanted to talk about was in C&I.  Are there any packets of weakness that you\u2019re seeing anywhere in terms of, you\u2019ve touched many different types of industries, is there any industry that you\u2019re seeing weakness in?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "You know, I don\u2019t think so.  I think if I think about this, we certainly see the tools, the industrial business which is basically hand tools being sold to wide variety industries, we don\u2019t see any particular weakness there yet.  The equipment business is very strong in Europe.  In the United States it\u2019s showing improvements, but it hasn\u2019t been as strong as Europe.  We\u2019d like to see that a little bit stronger.

", "Okay and then if we look at emerging market, can you just give us a rundown across your business of where you are strategy wise, both in terms of addressing the market as well as from a manufacturing perspective across the businesses?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Okay, let\u2019s talk about our manufacturing first.  We have plants now, 2 plants in [Kin Shon] outside of Shanghai, in effect the Shanghai area.  They produce power tools, they produce equipment, under car equipment, and they now produce saws, hacksaws specifically.  That\u2019s for the manufacturing, and obviously there\u2019s opportunity to put more product in those plants, we have a little more space, and there\u2019s more land available in that, so you\u2019ll see us pushing out from that footprint itself.  We do not, I guess, most importantly, make hand tools yet in Asia.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "Are any of those Snap-On branded?  ", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Well, yes.  We produce equipment for the Asian market that\u2019s Snap-On branded.  We produce power tools.  In fact, actually, we produce Snap-On branded power tools, Snap-On branded equipment for the Asian market and we produce a particular product called the CTS 561, a small screwdriver, like a cordless screwdriver, for the US market that is Snap-On branded.  Incidentally, our target was 15,000 and it sold 139,000 units which is more than any power tool in the history of Snap-On.  So it was a huge value to us and so we learned quite a lesson in that particular product line in terms of quality and in terms of introduction to the market.  Now the hacksaws, the saw product as you know are usually not sold under the Snap-On brand, they\u2019re sold under the Bahco brand and that\u2019s being produced in that way.  Okay, that\u2019s manufacturing.  If you look at distribution, David, we measure two things.  One is, and the distribution tends to sell the entire product line.  We have sales offices with product experts inhabiting those sales offices.  I think the numbers are in 2005 or 2004 we had two offices, now by the end of this year we\u2019ll have 20 in Asia Pacific.  I think the tag line I\u2019d like to say is when I arrived in Shanghai in 2003, all the people who worked for Snap-On in Shanghai arrived with me.  And now we have 353 people in Asia so we\u2019re expanding substantially, and then we have a number of what we call distributors throughout the region, I think the number is up to 425 now, and we keep pushing that up.  Obviously there\u2019s a bunch of support to that.  We\u2019re going to conduct 800 training sessions for those distributors this year and some of that business, obviously what happens, David, is different products in different markets take off better.  For example, next year the biggest buyer of hacksaws in the Snap-On world will be in Indonesia. I think we\u2019re one of the leading producers of hacksaws.  So this is starting to be a better and better business. But as we build it, we expect to accelerate in terms of growth.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "And your manufacturing in China other than that one product, that\u2019s all for the local region?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "You mean saws?", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "When you talked about the power equipment and saws.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "We manufacture a pretty full line of equipment, under car equipment.  We manufacture a selected line of power tools and simply the one hacksaw product for saws and we\u2019re going to expand beyond that as we go forward.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "Now are you exporting from there to other markets or is it that all for --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "We export power tools and we export hand saws. We don\u2019t now export equipment because it\u2019s been eating most of the capacity.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "And then where\u2019s your position today on the hand tools?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Right now we source out of Asia but obviously you can see us as I move forward our strategy would be to consider having hand tool production in Asia.  In fact, Asia\u2019s such a big market I think you have to think about making everything there or some version of everything.  It\u2019s worth saying when I talked about in the beginning disappointing customers, Asia was a place where we did disappoint a lot of customers. We have one of the most robust band saw businesses for example there.  We couldn\u2019t deliver enough.  We couldn\u2019t deliver enough hack saws until we got our full capacity in place.  So Asia would have been even bigger had we been able to deliver.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "There\u2019s been talk in the past there\u2019s been reluctance on producing the Snap-On branded hand tools outside of North America.  Is that still the case?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk ", "Yes, we\u2019re not looking to produce the hand tools but we looked at cordless power tools and we said, \u201cWhere are cordless power tools produced today?\u201d They\u2019re almost all produced in Asia and by the way from our perspective, it\u2019s Snap-On designed right here in Kenosha with our engineers using the latest finite element techniques and dynamic simulation techniques and produced in Asia under Snap-On supervision to Snap-On quality levels.  That applies for almost all the products but for hand tools our position is such in the United States that I don\u2019t see us actually moving Snap-On branded hand tools to Asia in the near term.  ", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "Okay, and then the last thing, Marty, on the light book, do you have any estimate of what impact that might have or not have here in 2008?", "Martin M. Ellen ", "I don\u2019t but since you asked, I would let everybody know that for the full year 2007, even though we had a $6 million gain in the fourth quarter, it was only about a half million for the full year, so that meant we had charges in the earlier quarters if you haven\u2019t looked back in 2006 while we had a $4 million charge in the fourth quarter, it was only $1 million for the full year so you do get some variation across the quarters but if you\u2019re looking at LIFO and you\u2019re trying to adjust margins on an operating basis, very little effect full year 2007 ", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. ", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.  I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Marty Ellen for any additional or closing comments.", "Martin M. Ellen ", "We thank you all for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Snap-On.  If you have any further questions or want clarification and information we released my contact information as shown at the bottom of the press release.  Thank you and have a good day.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s presentation.  We appreciate your participation and you may now disconnect.

We are about to begin.  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the 2008 first quarter results conference call hosted by Snap-on Incorporated.  (Operator instructions).  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Marty Ellen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  You may begin your conference, sir.", "Marty Ellen", "Thank you, Anthony, and good morning everyone.  Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter 2008 results.  By now, you should have seen our press release issued this morning.  We believe that despite more difficult business conditions in certain markets, this quarter continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the progress we are making in many of our core operating and growth initiatives.  We will discuss these with you today.  Joining me is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s President and CEO.  Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our achievements this quarter.  I will then provide a review of our financial results, and afterward we will take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussions.

Therefore, it cannot be recorded, transcribed or re-broadcast by any means without Snap-on\u2019s express permission.  With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick.  Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Marty.  For those of you following the slides my comments are outlined starting on slide #5. In general, Q1 was another encouraging period for our corporation \u2013 sales of $722 million and earnings of $0.97 a share.  Having said that I think we all know that the business environment was quite turbulent, and for Snap-on, that resulted in some specific positives by favorable interest rates and, of course, it created some general negatives like lower demand for larger purchases.  Overall, the operating earnings were up almost 36%, or $25 million.  ", "This is even though our sales were up only slightly after adjusting for currency and offsetting the timing of our OEM facilitation program.  Nine million of that increase came from our Financial Services segment.  That was reflecting continued strong yields, ongoing solid delinquencies, and lower market interest rates.  And all of that came together to drive that improvement.  Now, we cannot take credit for the earnings that resulted from interest rate movement, but what we can be encouraged by is executing our strategic initiatives across the corporation.", "With that overview, I would like to give you my take on the quarter.  Looking at slide 6 \u2013 North American demand for hand and power tools remains strong.  Innovation and continuing demand for immediate productivity solutions, they are serving us well.  On the other hand, sales of big-ticket items \u2013 things like tool storage boxes \u2013 they were impacted significantly by the economic atmospheres.  Beyond our home market, diversification has been an asset.  Our Worldwide businesses provided offsets to the North American turbulence.  ", "I believe I highlighted in the last quarter that Snap-on is increasingly an international corporation.  In fact, in the period, 44% of our sales came from outside the United States, and it helped.  A good example was the Worldwide Industrial business with global reach and with customers in critical industries like aviation, natural resources, and power generation, and, therefore, with activities in sectors that follow a diverse set of macroeconomics, that business grew pretty robustly.  Emerging markets were also strong, although expansion in that area is on a relatively small base.", "As we announced in our press release, we just completed the acquisition of a 60% majority ownership of Wanda Tools.  It is now named Wanda Snap-on Tools.  It is located in Zhejiang, China about 2 \u00bd miles southeast of Shanghai, and it is probably, we believe, the premier manufacturer of pliers in China.  The venture employs about 1,000 associates and has over 750,000 square feet of manufacturing space, and it brings with it extensive and relatively sophisticated product test labs that will serve us well going forward.  Wanda provides Snap-on, as we see it, extensive capacity for Asia-based, high-quality, hot-forged hand tools, and we are confident it will be a major contributor to the future of our corporation.  We have very pleased to welcome Wanda associates to our Snap-on family.", "We also recently approved another capacity expansion to add tool storage manufacturing capacity for our plant in Zhejiang, China.  If you put them together, Wanda Snap-on and Zhejiang expansion, these are two more important steps in filling out our product line and building our capabilities in the critical Asia Pacific theater.  We expect them to play a growing role in our path to the future.  Now on slide 7, the first quarter also saw continuing product innovation.  We believe in innovation that is consistent with our strong brand position.  ", "Innovation of investments across the corporations are continuing at a rapid.  In every business, in every product category, from hand tools, to power tools, to equipments, to diagnostics, to information-based products and across numerous dimensions with advancements in metallurgy, ergonomics, technology, processes, content management, and imaging.  The new products that we have spawned from those efforts are tremendously important to us, particularly in today\u2019s environment and difficult economic environments that we see today.  A great example is the NG725 pneumatic impact wrench \u2013 Light magnesium body, extraordinary power, great ergonomics \u2013 it is the market leader now.", "Talking about power tools if we could for a moment, a recent Frost & Sullivan survey, a survey of North American auto technicians, confirmed what we had already known.  Based on innovations like the NG725, Snap-on power tools are now the top choice of technicians, and we are pulling away from competition.  Over 40% of techs now prefer the Snap-on Grand, and that is up substantially from just a short time ago.  So that is part of the reason that power tools products have remained strong even in these difficult times.", "With that overview, let me landscape the individual groups.  As shown on slide 8, the Commercial and Industrial group, we call it C&I, registered sales increases of about 3.5 or 3.4% excluding currency.  As I mentioned before, Worldwide Industrial and Asia Pacific were prominent contributors.  Those increases, however, were partially offset by a shortfall in S&A. Europe, our tool business in Europe, where we saw some weakness that surfaced in the slowing economies of Southern Europe, particularly in Iberia.  Earnings for the group were up 36%.  ", "These included gains from currency translations and lower restructuring expenses.  But having said that, the primary earning drivers were the increased volume and strong cost reductions across the business, which more than offset higher levels, about $2.4 million higher, of investment in new markets for the period.  For C&I, I believe we can safely observe that Q1 was a confirmation of the group\u2019s diversity, its ability to withstand strong headwinds, and its continuing opportunity for efficiency improvement.", "Let\u2019s talk about the Tools group.  That is slide 9.  Overall sales were down 2% compared to 2007, 3% in North America.  This reflects the continuing lag in North American van count versus last year, and it is also due to a difficult comparison with the 2007 introduction and initial van fill of our mid-tier product line.  The van count was, in fact, up sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year.  Reduced franchisees, terminations, and ongoing recruiting efforts made progress.  That is the second straight quarter we have had an increase after a relatively long string of decline.  That is the good news.  The difficulty is that when compared with the levels of last year\u2019s first quarter, the van count was down by about 1.4%.  In addition to that hurdle, the mid-tier line was rolled out in Q1 of 2007.  Comparison against that initial van fill resulted in another 1% or so of sales shortfall.", "If you step back from those structural items, the ongoing van business did see continuing strength in hand and power tools.  As I believe I said in last quarter\u2019s calls, these are the products which immediately help detect [unintelligible] money, and the demand has remained robust.  As you might expect, though, bigger purchases like tool storage boxes have been impacted by the environment.  They are down substantially over last year at this time, and on balance, we saw a flat quarter for US vans.  Big-ticket reductions offset the strength in hand and power tools.", "Going forward, though, we believe filling open van territories is a near-term opportunity.  We continue to work hard in recruiting, training, and other initiatives to continue that improvement quarter-by-quarter, and we do, therefore, expect to see year-over-year progress as well as continuing strength in our hand and power tool line.  Looking inward, execution across the group is improving.  Terminations are down, complete and on-time deliveries are improving, our COT, or complete and on time, rates are up to 94%, that is an increase, and costs are being reduced in line with the times.  Along that line, we improved the field organizations significantly in the quarter reducing the regional sales offices from 13 to 9.  That move will result in lower cost and better resource alignment to support the franchisee, so we expect significant benefits for the Tools group from that change going forward.", "In the Diagnostics and Information group, organic sales growth was 5%.  Now that excludes the OEM Facilitation business where because of the wind down of two essential tool programs, they experienced a $19.5 million sales decline.  When we step back from that, I believe when we look at the organic growth, it is clear evidence that our software and information based products are continuing to sell and sell with reasonable strength, and they are contributing substantially to the improved profitability of that segment.  Also in the quarter, Snap-on Business Solutions performed consistent with our expectation, and made the solid contribution we always anticipated it would when we acquired it.", "Turning to slide 10, it is appropriate in rounding out my comments that I touch on our Global RCI and Lean initiatives.  We are spending quite a bit of time, energy, and commitment to imbed those processes into our culture, and I think it is clear they are paying big dividends.  It is making us more responsive to our customers and helping us to reduce cost.  An example, the first quarter is a great example.  In the first quarter, we show that rising global commodity prices and other inflation pressures clearly raised our cost, maybe in the neighborhood of $8 million compared to a year ago.  While our RCI initiatives more than offset that ride and made a significant contribution to earnings growth in the period.  Consider that our consolidated operating margin in the quarter reached 12.5%, that is up 290 basis points from a year ago.  Excluding the contribution from Financial Services, operating margins would have been up 11.1%, up 190 basis points.  In a world of increasing inflation and competition and economic bad news, we believe that is solid evidence of continuous improvement.", "In closing, I want to thank our franchisees for their loyalty and their ongoing contributions, which are a major strength for our corporation.  I also believe that it is important to note that these results would not have been possible without the efforts of our associates across the globe, and to each and every one of them I offer my congratulations and my thanks.  Now Marty will take us through the financial results.  Marty?", "Marty Ellen", "Thanks Nick.  I will begin on slide 12.  Net sales of $722 million in the quarter increased $16 million from 2007 levels.  Currency translation added $33 million while our OEM business declined by $19.5 million as Nick already mentioned.  As we have said before, our revenue comparisons can be significantly impacted by the timing of these OEM programs.  Factoring out the impacts of both currency and OEM programs sales decline, sales for the quarter across all of our other businesses were up slightly.  ", "On the positive side, we continue to experience higher sales to industrial customers worldwide and growth in emerging markets as well as increased sales of higher-margin diagnostics and information products.  On the down side, we experienced a 3.1% decline in US franchise sales in the Snap-on Tools Group.  As a measure of productivity improvement, sales per associate were up 10.5% from comparable 2007 levels as we continue to advance our RCI initiatives.", "In our Financial Services segment, revenue increased $12 million, and operating income improved $9 million, primarily reflecting lower market interest rates.  Consolidated gross profit of $326 million was up $16 million compared to the first quarter of 2007.  In dollar terms, the gross profit improvement includes $11 million of currency translation, nearly $7 million of savings from RCI initiatives, which more than offset $5.6 million of material and other cost increases.  Restructuring costs were lower by $3.6 million, and LIFO-related inventory costs were lower by $2.1 million.  ", "These increases were, of course, partially offset by the effect of the lower organic sales.  As a percentage of sales, gross margin improved to 45.2% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from prior year levels.  The improvement in the gross margin rate was also due to an improved sales mix that resulted from higher sales of higher margin diagnostics and information products and lower OEM facilitation sales, which typically have lowered comparable margins.", "Operating expenses of $245 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2007 levels.  Unfavorable currency translation added $8.6 million.  Increased spending to further expand our presence in emerging and growth markets added $2.4 million.  These were largely offset by over $6 million of benefits from RCI initiatives and $4.6 million of benefits from lower franchisee termination costs.  ", "Operating earnings of $93 million for the quarter were up nearly 36% from 2007 levels.  With currency translation contributing $3 million of the nearly $25 million increase.  Operating earnings as a percent of total revenues improved 12.5%, up 290 basis points from the 9.6% earned a year ago.  Interest expense in the quarter is down $1.8 million as a result of declining interest rates on our floating rate debt.", "Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 33.4% is up slightly from the 33% that we have previously communicated.  This is due primarily to the geographic mix of our earnings.  We anticipate that our full-year 2008 effective tax rate will now proximate the first quarter rate of 33.4%.  As a result of these factors diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.97 in the quarter were up 52% from the $0.64 earned last year.", "With that as an overall summary, I will now turn to our segment results.  Starting with the Commercial and Industrial group on slide 13, segment sales of $357 million in the quarter increased nearly $35 million over 2007 levels.  Currency translation added about $24 million.  Organic sales growth was 3.4%.  Organic sales increases included higher sales of tools to industrial customer, continued strong sales growth in emerging markets, and increased sales of power tools.  ", "These increases were partially offset by lower sales of BAHCO professional tools, primarily in Southern Europe, although recent sales order activity has improved.  First quarter operating earnings of $38 million for the C&I group were up 36% year-over-year on higher sales, ongoing contributions from RCI, and $3.9 million of lower restructuring costs.  Currency translation added $1.6 million to operating income.  Our industrial business has sales growth of 17% and contributed importantly to the operating income increase in the segment.  RCI improvements more than offset about $4.8 million of inflationary and other cost increases.  We also spent an additional $2.4 million to further expand our sales and manufacturing presence in emerging and growth markets.  As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the C&I segment improved 200 basis points in the quarter to 10.7% as compared to 8.7% a year ago.", "Turning now to slide 14, the Snap-on Tools group had first quarter sales of $289 million, which were up slightly from prior year levels.  Without the contribution from $7.5 million of currency translation, organic sales declined 2.3%.  In the US, sales declined 3.1%.  US van count this quarter-end was up slightly from year-end, but down 1.4% as compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.  About 1% or so of the US sales decline resulted from lapping the van fill associated with our mid-tier product launch last year.  While sales of large ticket tool storage and equipment products declined, this was mostly offset by increased sales of hand tools.  ", "First quarter operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $34.4 million were up over $5 million from prior year levels.  The impact of the lower organic sales in North America was more than offset by benefits from cost improvements and RCI initiatives, including $4.6 million of lower franchisee termination costs due to lower number of terminations and improvements in the process.  Operating earnings improved from 10.2 percent of sales for the first quarter of 2007 to 11.9% of sales in 2008.  This year\u2019s first quarter included very little LIFO effect, but the year ago quarter included $2 million of LIFO-related charges.  Currency translation added $1.4 million to operating income.", "Turning to the Diagnostics and Information group, which is shown on slide 15, first quarter sales of $155 million were down $11.5 million before $2.7 million of contribution from currency translation.  The OEM Facilitation business experienced a $19.5 million sales decline.  They were lapping a first quarter 2007 roll out of a major essential tool program in North America and the wind down of a program in Europe.  The rest of the segment grew 5.1% on higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 information products.  As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of $20.4 million in the quarter improved to 13.2% in 2008 from 12.6% in the first quarter of 2007.", "Turning to slide 16, our Financial Services segment revenues were $25.4 million compared to $13.4 million last year while income from Financial Services rose from $3.7 million last year to $12.8 million this year.  The increase in both revenues and income relates primarily to our US Credit business as a result of lower market interest rates.  The discount rate on extended credit contracts fell by about 290 basis points when compared to a year ago.", "Now let me turn to a brief discussion of our balance sheet and cash flow.  As seen on slide 17, our accounts receivable and inventory levels increased $63 million from year-end levels with about $30 million of the reported increase coming from currency.  The three-day increase in day sales outstanding to 76 days was primarily due to a shift in business mix.  Inventories in Industrial and Asia increased to support higher sales growth.  Our net debt position at the end of the first quarter is $409 million, which is down from $425 million at year-end 2007.  Our net debt to total capital of 22.8% is down from 24.9% at year-end 2007 and down from a high of 31.5% shortly after the Business Solutions acquisition.", "Turning to slide 18, cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $74 million, up significantly from $27 million in the first quarter of 2007.  Free cash flow of $59 million was also up significantly from $13.7 million last year.  We also completed the acquisition of a 60% interest in Wands Tools, a hot pour, hand-tool manufacturer in China, at a cost of $13.4 million.  The acquisition, which closed in March, had no material impact on quarterly operating results.", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance.  Now I would like to briefly review with you some financial considerations for the balance of 2008.  These are shown on slide 19.  With respect to full-year 2008, we expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives including further investments in Asia and other global emerging markets.  We also expect to continue implementing our other strategic and RCI initiatives intended to enable higher levels of growth and profitability.  We anticipate full-year 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of $15 to $20 million and full-year capital expenditures to be in a range of $55 to $60 million.  And, as I already said, we also expect our 2008 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.4%.  As a result, we continue to expect that full-year 2008 sales and operating earnings will improve over 2007 levels.", "Before opening the calls for questions, Nick would like to provide some closing thoughts.  Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Marty.  I believe we can summarize by saying the first quarter results were affected by some big winds: favorable interest rates in an unfavorable North American economy.  The results reflected some challenges, weak big-ticket sales, working off our year-over-year lower van count, and the timing of the OEM essential tool programs.  It also represented some nice gains: worldwide Industrial serving critical industries, Asia Pacific increased and growing our capability, and our Diagnostics and Information software sales remain strong.  It is also worth noting that RCI again played a big part in our quarter.  The operations overcame cost increases and then some with strong productivity and efficiency gains.", "Going forward we are quite positive.  This corporation has strong positions, robust business models, extraordinary brands, and a diverse customer base and significant runway.  As we have said in the past, there also remains abundant opportunity for improvement throughout the organization.  On top of that, we believe we have a strong team that is committed and capable to take full advantage of the opportunities going forward.  With that, operator, I will turn the call over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir.  (Operator instructions).  We will take our first question from Jonathan Steinmetz at Morgan Stanley.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All right, great, thanks.  Good morning everyone, can you hear me okay?  So a few questions.  First, starting in the dealer group can you just elaborate a little bit upon the $4.6 million of lower franchisee terminations?  Just talk a little bit maybe about what exactly this consists of and if you are able to provide the absolute levels year-on-year so that we can compare it and try to get an idea of how long this can persist.", "Marty Ellen", "Good morning, John, it is Marty.  That is the lower cost of terminations associated with a lower number of terminations.  So terminations are going down, that is the good news.  You should surmise that from the fact that our van count is starting to level out over the last couple of quarters, and we have improved the process.  Our field structure, our franchise performancing structure, one of the reasons it was put in place to work more closely with our franchisees, and those that are in trouble we are working with sooner in the process, and by doing that we recover more in the termination process, particularly in terms of inventory recovery, which the more we get back from them, the lower our accounts receivable exposure is.  So that was an important process improvement.  I do not have last year\u2019s number, Jonathan, but we actually think going forward we should still expect some favorability in terms of lower termination costs.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So not just staying at this level, but from a year-on-year perspective, continuing to be favorable?", "Marty Ellen", "We think because we have improved the process, remember that is a big part of our CI is process improvement, we will have terminations, hopefully lower terminations.  That continues to be our plan as we build the fleet back of vans and franchisees, but because of the improvement in the process, lower terminations, we expect some upside still in future quarters.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and I know you don\u2019t know the exact number, but just maybe order of magnitude.  I am just not exactly sure whether this is a $15 million line item or $20 or $30 or whatever it is, but any order of magnitude that you can provide.", "Marty Ellen", "I would characterize it in the mid teens.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  Sticking with the dealer group, you guys commented that big ticket items were down substantially and some of the hand tools were up.  Can you talk about how far down they were and maybe what percentage of your business this consists of, because it seems like hand tools would have had to be up a lot to get you even to where you were.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Jonathan, this is Nick.  Hand tools and power tools were both up.  They were up between 5 and 10%.  The big ticket items were down somewhat more, closer to 10%, so that\u2019s the kind of balance.  We actually sell more power tools and hand tools in aggregate than we do tool storage and what we would classify as big-ticket items.  What you do is you have a bigger base of hand tools moving up pretty robustly between 6, 7, 8% depending on what product line you look at, and tool storage is down close to 10%.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, we can triangulate with the mix.  And the last question I guess I would have is on the finance income.  Do you think $12 to $13 million, is that sort of a sustainable level in your view as we move throughout the year?  I am just trying to short rate to move back up a little bit in the last few weeks.  I am just trying to understand.  We have clearly been unable to model this line item, so I am just curious.  I know you do not provide guidance, but how should we think about that going forward.", "Marty Ellen", "John, this is Marty.  As you know, first of all, the revenue, it is the US part of the business that is driving all of this.  The revenue that we report comes from the sales of contracts, so the discount rate is very sensitive to that gain and, of course, as I said rates were down 290 basis points.  The benchmark rate, I would need look at, there is a two-year treasury given the average term of those contracts.  So one has to take a view on where you think interest rates are going to model that.  That is point one.  I am not going share our view.  Everybody has got, probably, their own view.  We think rates will stay at these levels for a little while.", "The other comment I would make is originations are obviously the underlying volume measure you saw in the slide.  Originations were up a little bit.  Stuff that gets financed through our credit business are the larger ticket items.  And actually, interestingly, while we commented tool storage, for example, was down in the quarter if you look at the trajectory through the quarter, it actually picked up a little bit as we exited the quarter.  So maybe that is a good sign.  But to model it, you really have got to think about the movement and underlying [unintelligible] treasury, and you have got to think about the level of originations.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, and I guess with the originations picking up it seems like there is a little bit of a disconnect, so are people going to you guys more for financing as a source of credit ability, and lastly here, and I\u2019ll jump off and let someone else go on.  You had talked in the past about delinquency statistics here without seeing a big uptake are you starting to see any change at all there?", "Marty Ellen", "First of all, John is right.  I mean, obviously with sales down and originations up that meant more business came.  But not surprising over the last couple of years we competed with cheap credit card offerings and like, and of course, those had simply gone away.  So we become the next best attractive financing alternative.  And the portfolio continues to perform very well.  In fact, when we look at 30 days plus and 60 days plus delinquency trends, they are actually down at the end of March and still at very low historic levels, that uptake a little bit we commented at last quarter at the end of December.  So that draws the contribution as Nick said, the portfolio yields.  We have not changed our pricing parameters.  We have priced this credit risk, we think very appropriately, and when we have managed delinquencies well and then get the tailwind associated with a low discount rate, as you have seen here.  You would see it again if you went back to 2003 when rates were low, we get a very nice contribution from that business.", "Jonathan Steinmetz \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We will go next to Alexander Paris at Barrington Research Associates.", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Good morning, great quarter.  Of course we would like to see a little better top-line growth.  Speaking of that, the RCI, do you have enough projects out there to keep the same kind of net positive contribution or close to it for the remaining quarters of the year to you think?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we feel pretty strongly that that is true.  I think we said that we had 103 or 104 dedicated RCI people sprinkled throughout the organization.  They are all working diligently.  We have people here guiding them.  We are still involving [not a clue] from Japan.  So we feel pretty strong about the opportunity.  I think I have shared this with you perhaps before when Marty and I or Jack walk around the corporation, we just see so many ways in which we can improve.  And I think we have said that we are targeting 2010, we see ourselves making strong mid double digit returns, and we feel we can get there pretty much through cost reduction.  Or we would like to get there through balance, but if we had balance between sales and cost reduction, but if the sales turned down, we believe we have a lot of runway in cost improvement.", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Great.  Looking at China now that you have made the other acquisition, how do you see that business developing?  I imagine there is good opportunity, but in terms of your three segments.  For example, is there a possibility of van business in China or is it all going to be more C&I and D&I?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think right now the way I see the China market, there is little possibility of van business.  Generally, the vans are effective where technicians own their own tools, and the jurisdictions where that does not happen they usually are relatively marginal.  So in China, as most of the world, the technicians do not own their own tools, so the proprietary model will not work.", "We believe, however, that we have technology and product quality and ergonomics will set us apart from other people and, therefore, be able to get a kind of proprietary priority position in the marketplace.  We are seeing that somewhat in equipment now where we throw out our imaging product in there, we are gaining share dramatically, one that will give us a base to start that with hand tools.  We have not in the past because we have been lobbing hand tools in there from Europe and the United States, and they just do not have the cost position that can compete in that market.", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Okay, thank you.  Just one other question.  I know in the past, once in a while, you have a surprisingly poor third quarter because of some big jump in gasoline prices.  How would you see a possibility of a magnetive effect on your third quarter if gasoline goes to $4 as a lot of people are talking?", "Nick Pinchuk", "We have looked at the effect of gasoline on our franchisees.  There are probably two factors.  One is the lower driving.  Generally, though, when we step back and look at the macros in the marketplace now, the spending on automotive repair has remained fairly strong, fairly reasonable.  So we feel relatively good about that going forward.  Now I can\u2019t predict how that would be affected as the gasoline prices go up and up.  On the other hand, on our vans their costs go up.  So their costs have probably doubled in the last say six or seven months, and we have been working with them on productivity to make sure that they can make up some of that in terms of their margin expansion.  And in the time in which the gasoline prices have risen over the last six or eight months, we have seen our franchisees\u2019 general profitability rise.  So we have been able to offset it just by projecting our CI improvements in the franchisee system.", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Great.  Thank you very much.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions).  We will take our next question from Jim Lucas at Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thanks.  Good morning guys.  Could you give us a reminder on a couple of these headwind issues which are more timing related, both the van count and the OEM project.  At what point do we get to more of an apples to apples comparison?  Is that the second half of the year?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Looking out into the second quarter, we see the OEM\u2019s start to decay.  I think we would say it would be about half of what it is today, and then it starts to decay down in the third quarter and fourth quarter from that level.  So you can see it go from 19, you might chop it in half in terms of effect, and then it gets much less significant in the third and fourth quarter.", "In terms of the van count, we start to catch up\u2026  Our goal is to try to catch up as soon as possible, but you start to get easier comparisons in the third and fourth quarter.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay.  I was a little bit surprise to hear about the softness that you are seeing in Southern Europe.  When you look at the Western European economy, if you step away from\u2026 if we count Eastern Europe as more of an emerging market than Western Europe in general, whether it is in your industrial or equipment businesses, what does the overall environment look like today for you?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Jim, we are actually seeing reasonable growth in places like the UK and Scandinavia and the low countries.  We got hurt in the quarter in Spain and Portugal, and if you look at the economic news there in the first quarter, they revised downward their G&P assessments.  So we think that had our distributors take a pause.  We had the same kind of thing in Italy, which has been slow for some time.  So we kind of see that as a quarter effect.  What we are seeing now is better order rates.  And, in fact, the order book is relatively strong in Europe, so we expect to see some recovery in the second quarter in that area.", "Our take on that is is that the economic news hit in the first quarter in Spain.  We are the market leader in Spain by a long shot, and in Portugal, and in some of those Southern European countries, and distributors just wanted to take a pause.  Now we are seeing them come back.  The magnitude of that comeback, I am not sure.  We expect to see some recovery.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay.  And when we take a look here, I mean I think you have done a good job in terms of mapping out the issues impacting the organic numbers in the first quarter and how that potentially gets better as the year progresses.  Margins continue to be a great upset prize as well as financial services.  When we look at the balance sheet and you had this nice small strategic acquisition in the first quarter, but can you talk about capital allocation priorities?  We highlight them every quarter, but have they changed.  Are we seeing anything different out there?", "Marty Ellen", "Jim, it is Marty.  I will make a comment, and then maybe Nick wants to make a comment.  First of all, just to add some color, I think we are not just in Spain, but elsewhere I said tool storage seems to be picking up.  So hopefully we have got some positive trajectory coming out of first quarter in terms of top line, and we will continue to expand margins as we have said.  We remind everybody by 2010 we expect to be mid-teens operating profitability, and we think we are moving directionally there.  So we are pleased with that.", "Capital allocation continues to be the same.  Yes, we made a small acquisition.  We continue to look for acquisitions like that that will give us a very immediate ability to grow in the markets that are growing or to expand our product offering through our existing distribution or gain access to distribution and customers.  Nothing transforming, nothing large, and we continue to want to work the balance sheet to generate as much free cash flow as we can.  The priority has always been our dividend, of course, and we look at raising that each and every year if our board so chooses.  Share repurchases to offset dilution, we will continue to do that.  I have guided you guys on capital spending including the capital addition that we are making in China to bring tool storage manufacturing capability into China.  And that is sort of the goal to keep the ship in that straight line for now.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I would like add one thing to that, Jim, is that I would just slightly clarify the characterization of Wanda as a small acquisition.  It was small in terms of financial impact, but the physical capabilities are a monster.  It is 750,000 square feet of fine manufacturing space.  It is a number of product labs.  It is 1,000 capable associates.  This is a very strong company, which we feel very [unintelligible] about being able to wield to our advantage in the future.  I hope someday I can guide you on a tour of the facility.  I think you would be impressed.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "I will look forward to that.  All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions).  And with no further questions left in the queue Mr. Ellen I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks, sir.", "Marty Ellen", "Well thank you everybody, and thank you for your interest in Snap-on.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Martin Ellen, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Ellen you may begin your conference.", "Martin Ellen", "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s second quarter 2008 results. By now you should have seen our press release issued this morning. Despite challenges in both the US economy and commodity price inflation we believe that our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the soundness of our business model and the progress that is being made in many of our core operating and growth initiatives. We will discuss these with you today. ", "Joining me is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s President and CEO. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our strategic achievements. I will then provide a review of our financial results and afterward we will take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion.

Therefore it cannot be recorded, transcribed or re-broadcast by any means without Snap-on\u2019s express permission. With that said I will now turn the call over to Nick. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Martin, for those of you following the slides my comments start on slide number five. You know I think we can say that the second quarter for Snap-on was another encouraging period. I believe it represents further and clear evidence of our continuing progress. Sales were up 7.6%, earnings per share grew almost 28% and our operating margin reached 14.2%. That\u2019s up 220 basis points over last year\u2019s second quarter. So needless to say it\u2019s a positive result. And that\u2019s I think particularly true given the increasing economic challenges we see in the environment today.", "I\u2019m going to be landscaping that progress in more detail but before I go further, I want to thank our associates and our franchisees. Your considerable capability and your extraordinary effort made these results possible. My congratulations and my thanks to all of you. I feel fortunate to be part of your team.", "So let\u2019s review the second quarter, its clear every day that these can be uncertain times. We are reminded of that almost every newscast, but against these difficulties we believe Snap-on has considerable offsets; a growing global position with strength in Europe and North America, an expanding presence in emerging markets, a diverse set of customers from automotive repair to aerospace to natural resources. Those are industries that follow a varied set of macros.", "We\u2019re also well positioned with almost legendary brands and for a number of quarters we\u2019ve demonstrated a continuing capability of creating strong value through relentless and repeatable innovation, fairly passionate customer care and of course, rapid continuous improvement. Those are strategic advantage and capabilities that are quite valuable especially in the uncertain environment we face today.", "And our second quarter was a demonstration of those strengths. To detail some of the progress we are growing globally. Snap-on sales outside the United States are now 46% of our total, up several points from last year and each of our major regions, North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, grew in the period even after neutralizing the effect of currency translations. ", "In the emerging economies of Asia and Eastern Europe growth was 17% and these markets now comprise over 8% of our sales. You know its still relatively early days but we\u2019re encouraged, we\u2019re very encouraged by the success in those areas. And we see further opportunity to keep investing, keep building our physical capability. In fact some of the increase in capital spending that we\u2019ve registered so far this year and the reason we\u2019re guiding our full year up modestly, is to support the growth in those strategic theaters. ", "For example our factory in Kunshan near Shanghai is now producing power tools, under car equipment and hacksaws. Those of you listening might recall that we recently transferred from some of our state of the art hacksaw technology from Sweden to China. It was a tough transfer but it was a successful migration and we\u2019re now selling quite well out of that factory with that great product. ", "So now bolstered by that success, we\u2019re expanding again to manufacture tool storage in Kunshan. That production will be targeted at both western and Asian markets where we see ample opportunity. And with last quarter\u2019s acquisition of our 60% interest in Wanda Snap-on in Zhejing, China, we now have in-region capability to manufacture a full range of low cost, high quality hot-forged hand tools. ", "Besides manufacturing we\u2019re also aggressively expanding our sales and distribution network throughout Asia. In fact we expect to have a network of over 600 resellers by the end of this year and that\u2019s up over 50% over last year. Eastern Europe is sometimes an overlooked area. We\u2019ve just approved a relocation and expansion of our plant in Minsk. Our existing facility in that city for several years has demonstrated that it can produce some of the highest quality and lowest cost cutting product in the world.", "When I tour that factory I like what I see in the workforce so we\u2019re doubling down our investment in that area. There is abundant opportunity in Eastern Europe for Snap-on. We have an encouraging start in the region and we\u2019re going to take full advantage. So you see we have substantial runway in emerging markets, potential that\u2019s very right for Snap-on products and value. Those markets are all growing and they\u2019re still unclaimed. So we\u2019ll continue to pursue aggressively and we saw some of that positive affect in the second quarter. ", "Let\u2019s move on to slide six, beyond geography the overall diversity and strength of our customer base has served us well again this quarter. Now clearly our US franchise business faced some headwinds; the decline in home prices, rampant increase in things like fuel, energy, and food does have an impact. That said we continue to believe that the vehicle repair industry is more resistant to downturn then many other sectors. Sales of new cars to be sure have declined dramatically and the recent data suggests that a 2% to 4% decrease in miles driven in the US has been a reaction to the rise in gasoline prices. ", "However published data also does report that there\u2019s been an increase in spending in automotive repair and it further indicates a modest real increase in technician wages. Now there\u2019s a logic to this phenomenon, with new car sales down the car part does get older. Almost 40% of the US cars are now greater then 10 years old and much of the driving in the United States is not discretionary. Therefore vehicle repair is a continuing necessity from that perspective.", "And so from that perspective the increase in repair spending, even in the face of economic slowdown is not really a surprise. We do recognize however that our customers the automotive technicians are also consumers. In this environment they are more deliberate in their spending. Therefore not surprisingly sales of higher priced tool storage products which are more discretionary purchases then hand and power tools, those continue to be weak in the quarter. They continued weakness in the quarter and that softness accounted for about half of our reported 4% sales decline in the US van business.", "Our sales of equipment and diagnostics were similarly impacted. It makes sense; those products are more like capital investments and traditionally they are a tougher sell in uncertain times. Now as you might guess though, I want to landscape the United States for you in terms of the van business, as you might guess the results aren\u2019t uniform across the country. In certain regions in the US mostly in the central and the Midwest, our franchisees are reporting on average, mid single-digit growth rates.", "However in regions like the southeast and southwest where home prices have suffered the most and consumer confidence is the lowest, our franchisees are having more difficult time and there is a clear decline. So what you\u2019re seeing from the tools group is a downturn in troubled and a softness in bigger ticket items offset somewhat by the other parts of the United States and their international business. ", "What is challenging though for all our franchisees across the country are higher fuel prices but the corporation, all of us, are working hard to mitigate the problem. We\u2019re aggressively using our RCI and our innovation processes, our two cornerstones of the way Snap-on creates value, we\u2019re using those tools to find ways for the franchisees to offset the fuel cost increase and it\u2019s having a positive affect.", "We\u2019ve identified some real efficiencies and offset some of those costs and we\u2019ll keep working hard to maintain our franchisees\u2019 profitability in the weeks and months ahead because they are important to us. We\u2019re often asked about van count, the US van count, well it was flat in the quarter remaining down about just a little over 1% versus last year. Now terminations did improve, but the count remains flat because we\u2019ve raised the standard for accepting new franchisees. ", "Being more selective has played out in reducing first year franchisee problems and that\u2019s been positive but it\u2019s made it harder to expand and as a consequence, the overall franchisee number has not risen. We do believe however the open territories still represent a considerable opportunity. We have been and we\u2019re continuing to employ significant resources in both franchise recruitment and training and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll see the van count increase going forward in the second half of this year.", "So while the Snap-on tool segment of our business is more challenged other customers in other market segments are generating substantial growth. In the US industrial business the focus on critical buyers, the military, aerospace, natural resources, and the automotive vocational training sector, once again this quarter that focus contributed substantial growth to the commercial and industrial segment. Overall the US industrial business grew 25%. That process is quite encouraging and I think it\u2019s important to note that that expansion reflects Snap-on\u2019s direct industrial sales force.", "It\u2019s probably the most powerful in the industry and sometimes overlooked. WE believe it\u2019s the most powerful in the industry with more than 500 well trained professionals. They consider themselves solutioneers and that they are, they provide tailored product solutions for the specific needs of their customers and it is having substantial success even in this environment. ", "In the broad industrial segment customers value the productivity that comes from Snap-on solutions and our unique direct sales force delivers that value. So we see abundant opportunity in industrial going forward and we believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to take advantage. ", "Moving outside the United States where economies are somewhat less challenging we are able to achieve fairly solid growth not only in emerging markets but in developed ones as well. Strong double-digit growth was achieved in our international franchise business in the UK, Australia and Japan as well as in our European diagnostics business. And despite the slowing of many of the major economies in Europe, our European hand tools business, SNA Europe was able to grow by 3.5% in the period without counting the benefits of the strength in the currency.", "So clearly diversity of both geography and market segments is providing us with a platform for balanced growth. I should add that our portfolio of strong and well positioned brand is also a major factor. Whether its Snap-on tools in the automotive and industrial sector or Baco saws and wrenches in both industry and professional trades, our brands speak of reliability, design and productivity enhancing attributes that provide strong customer value.", "And beyond that our expanded mid tier products are also working as expected, they are adding to our reach and building our penetration in broader segments. So Snap-on, Baco and Blue Point and our other corporate brands are recognized widely as making work easier and helping our customers make more money and that plays out well in every environment.", "Moving to slide seven regarding product innovation, it\u2019s been our heritage and it\u2019s been our hallmark and it\u2019s never been more important then in slow economic times. It\u2019s clearly helping stimulate our growth and its also helping drive cost reduction. Yes innovation can drive cost reduction too. Let me give you a few examples. In our power tools business which is a critical supplier to our franchisees our new half-inch impact wrench which exceeds 800 lbs. of torque, and our three-eighths inch cordless impact wrench, both lead the industry in power weight ratio.", "These tools were both introduced this year and both are big sellers. They both, and this is important in the situation, they both give our franchisees and salesmen something exciting to sell and both have been major contributors to the strong growth in that category. We have consistently said I think that hand and power tools are the purchases that translate immediately into productivity improvement.", "When technicians make tough choices in an uncertain economy they tend to choose products like our professional tools that will help them expand their prospects and hot new innovations like the two power tools I\u2019ve mentioned, help amplify that tendency. That means that purchases in those product segments are more resilient to uncertain economies. And in fact all of that is playing out in our results even in that market.", "Beyond power tools we have also recently upgraded our versions of the Modis and the Solus handhelds in our diagnostic business, extending their technical leadership and indications are quite positive. We are just launching, and I\u2019m pretty excited about this, we are also just launching our new imaging aligner. It features patented imaging technology with great value and our early returns from customers in both North America and Europe seem to confirm that conclusion.", "And those are just a few examples of Snap-on innovation at work. Going forward in any environment we plan to keep investing in innovation at a strong pace across all our businesses because we know it will pay off. We are increasingly working to improve the processes that create value through innovation listening to the voice of the customers through out franchisees, we have 3,500 of them scattered throughout the United States and 4,700 worldwide, through field research and through our unique Snap-on new innovation centers which we are putting up in the corporation where we study the way our products create better solutions. ", "We are confident that those types of processes and process improvements will help continue and help expand the parade of cost effective products that will make our customers more productive and importantly more profitable.", "Our rapid continuous improvement or RCI initiatives also helped strengthen our operating platform in the period. They created more value for our enterprise just as they have in multiple quarters past. A good example is the complete and on time deliveries for our US distribution system or COT as we call it. COT reached about 96% at the end of the second quarter, up from 94% last quarter and up from substantially lower just a few years ago. That\u2019s good progress. But as I\u2019ve said on many other calls our goal is 99%. We are not giving up so we have a long way to go. ", "And I suppose one of the most important issues of the day is commodity cost inflation. It\u2019s a challenge for every business. For us we\u2019re most vulnerable to the rising cost of steel and fuel. In the second quarter we estimate that those cost increases for Snap-on were about $6 million over last year and the pain will probably approach $10 million next quarter but in the second quarter productivity improvements from our RCI initiatives and our selected price increases combined to cover that inflation and then some.", "In fact a significant component of our second quarter results was the improvement we saw from RCI. And while we expect commodity cost pressures to increase going forward we believe we\u2019ll be able to offset them because RCI is part of our every day and because we continue to see as we go around the corporation we continue to see very abundant opportunity for improvement. In the second quarter our productivity improved by over 10% versus 2007 and we see that trend continuing.", "So as I said the second quarter was an encouraging period. It was a further confirmation of the strength of our business model, the breadth of our operation, and our capability for improvement. We were quite encouraged. Now Martin will take us through some of the details of the results. ", "Martin Ellen", "Thanks Nick, turning to slide nine net sales of $766 million in the quarter increased $54 million or 7.6%. Currency translation contributed 4.5%. Strong growth contributions this quarter came from sales of tools and equipment to commercial and industrial customers worldwide, emerging market growth, and increased sales of higher margin diagnostics and information products.", "Sales in our international franchise operations also increased, up 18.2% without currency. Given the economic headwinds in the US our franchisee sales were down 4.1% particularly in sales of big ticket tool storage and other products. As in prior quarters or OEM essential tool and facilitation business experienced $13 million of lower sales due to the lapping of certain 2007 OEM programs. ", "This negative OEM comparison reduced our global growth rate by 2%. Consolidated gross profit of $346.5 million was up $24.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2007. The gross profit margin of 45.2% was relatively flat compared to last year. Pricing improvements and benefits from RCI initiatives covered steel, freight and other product cost inflation. Offsetting these improvements in gross margin was the less favorable sales mix in the Snap-on tools group. ", "In addition lower restructuring of $5.7 million benefited the gross margin. Operating expenses of $245.6 million in the quarter were up $5.5 million from 2007 including $9 million of unfavorable currency translation, $1.7 million of inflationary cost increases and $1.2 million of higher restructuring costs. These increases were partially offset by $3.9 million of lower franchisee termination costs and $3.5 million of benefits from RCI initiatives. ", "As a percent of sales operating expenses improved 160 basis points to 32.1% in the second quarter as compared to 33.7% last year. In our financial services segment operating income improved $5.7 million primarily reflecting lower market interest rates. Operating earnings of $111.7 million for the quarter were up 27.8% from 2007 with currency translation contributing $2.3 million of the $24.3 million increase.", "Operating earnings as percent of total revenues improved to 14.2% up 220 basis points from the 12% earned a year ago. Interest expense in the quarter is down $2.9 million primarily as a result in declining interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels in the quarter. Our effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests is 33.1% in the second quarter. We anticipate that for the full year this rate will be 33.3%.", "Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.15 in the quarter were up nearly 28% from the $0.90 earned last year. With that as an overall summary I will now turn to our segment results.", "Starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide 10 segment sales of $387.7 million in the quarter increased $56.1 million over 2007. Currency translation added about $25 million. Excluding currency sales were up 9.4% which included higher sales to industrial customers, increased sales of power tools and imaging alignment systems, continued strong sales growth in emerging markets, and higher sales of professional tools in Europe.", "Second quarter operating earnings of $49.3 million for the segment was up $16.8 million or 51.7% from prior year levels. Currency translation contributed $1.5 million of the increase. Also contributing to the year-over-year earnings increase were higher sales and pricing including a 21% increase in sales in our worldwide industrial business, and $5 million of lower restructuring costs.", "Savings from RCI and cost reduction initiatives offset $3.7 million of commodity and other cost increases. As a percentage of sales operating earnings in the CNI segment improved 290 basis points in the quarter to 12.7% from 9.8% last year. ", "Turning now to slide 11 the Snap-on tools group reported second quarter sales of $292.8 million which was up $8.8 million or 3.1% from prior year. Currency translation contributed 1.9%. The groups\u2019 international operations reported double-digit growth led by a strong performance in the UK and Japan. Sales in the US however declined 4.1% for the reasons Nick already mentioned. ", "Second quarter operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $35.3 million were up $600,000 from prior year levels. Pricing and RCI improvements net of cost increases coupled with less favorable product sales mix in total reduced the gross margin by about 100 basis points. Additionally there was about 100 basis point reduction in gross margin representing profit transfer to other segments as a result of higher sales of their products by the franchise channel.", "While currency translation added $1.6 million to reported operating expenses reduced franchisee termination costs were a major factor in the improved operating expense comparison. As a result operating earnings of 12.1% of sales in the quarter for the Snap-on tools group were essentially flat with prior year levels. ", "Turning to the diagnostics and information group which is shown on slide 12 second quarter sales of %164.8 million were essentially flat with prior year levels. Higher diagnostic sales in Europe, increased sales of Mitchell1 information products, and $2.9 million of currency translation were more then offset by lower OEM program sales. As we\u2019ve said in the past revenue comparisons for the OEM business are influenced by the timing of these OEM programs. ", "As a result of two major programs last year this year\u2019s comparison reflects a $13.2 million sales decline. This comparison is expected to be substantially better in the third quarter. Excluding these OEM programs the diagnostics and information segment grew 8.8%. As a percentage of sales operating earnings in the quarter of $31 million improved 18.8% from 17.7% in the second quarter of 2007. ", "Turning to slide 13 our financial services segment revenues were $18.3 million compared to $14.8 million last year while income from financial services rose from $5.1 million last year to $10.8 million this year. The increase in both revenues and income relates primarily to our US credit business. The major contributor to the earnings improvement was the year-over-year decline in market interest rates with the discount rate on extended credit contracts down 230 basis points. ", "Now let me turn to a brief discussion of our balance sheet and cash flow, as seen on slide 14 our accounts receivable and inventory levels increased $86 million from year end levels, with about $27 million of the increase coming from currency translation. Days sales outstanding increased by one day to 74 days from both year end and June, 2007 levels primarily due to a shift in business mix that includes higher levels of international receivables which typically have longer payment terms. ", "Inventories increased primarily to support anticipated sales growth including higher levels of inventory for industrial customers and to support our growth initiatives in emerging markets. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter is $383 million which is down from $425 million at year end 2007. Our net debt to capital ratio of 21.3% is down from 24.9% at year end 2007. ", "Turning to slide 15 cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $80.5 million and free cash flow was $62.6 million. The contribution to cash flow from the higher earnings was partially offset by the higher levels of receivables and inventory shown on this slide as part of the change in operating assets and liabilities. This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance, now I would like to briefly review with you some financial considerations for the balance of 2008 which are shown on slide 16.", "With respect to full year 2008 we expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives including further investments in Asia and other global emerging markets. We also to expect to continue implementing our other strategic and RCI initiatives intended to enable higher levels of growth and profitability. ", "We anticipate full year 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of $13 million to $16 million, down from the previously communicated $15 million to $20 million. And we now expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $60 million to $65 million, up from the previous $55 million to $60 million primarily to support the growth initiatives Nick mentioned. ", "And as I said we also expect our 2008 effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interest to be about 33.3%. As a result we expect that sales and operating earnings will improve over 2007 levels for the balance of the year. ", "Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Martin, our second quarter did have some challenges; economic headwinds yielding a softness in big ticket sales in the US, commodity cost increases and the wind down of the OEM essential tools programs. Despite that we did have an encouraging period. Our growth strategies reaching globally and expanding in critical industries that value productivity, those initiatives served us well. And the performance was also an indication that the Snap-on way of creating value in our space, relentless innovation and rapid continuous improvement helped us overcome the difficulties of the day. ", "As for the rest of the year we know our businesses are not immune to economic conditions but we believe our model is well balanced, spread across many geographies and varied and significant customer bases. We are confident that our improvement processes can create substantial value even in difficult environments. Going forward then we remain positive. This corporation has strong positions, robust business models, extraordinary brands, a diverse customer base, and a great team of associates and franchisees. ", "Yes there are bumps in the road but we continue to believe that considerable runway remains and Snap-on is well positioned to take full advantage. Now we\u2019ll take any questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I know you don\u2019t give specific guidance and in your conversation you\u2014in your comment at the end you didn\u2019t really talk about your outlook for\u2014the economic outlook for your end markets and some of those that Nick mentioned and whether you think those\u2014just what your assumptions are for going forward. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we see issues but we believe we can manage them affectively. I think I said on prior calls that we expect our volume growth to be in the mid single-digit range and that is roughly what we have in this quarter and we expect our earnings growth to be 15% plus quarter-by-quarter and we see nothing that should discourage us from that. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "As we are listening to earnings calls here this week, we\u2019re hearing a lot of talk about pretty meaningful weakness in the European market particularly construction end markets, economic activities clearly slow here in the US, doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better, Europe seems to be getting worse, the Asian market seems to be weakening, so in that context with what you\u2019ve done in the first half of the year, it seems like the second half of the year has more challenges then what you\u2019ve experienced here in Q2. ", "Martin Ellen", "You\u2019re correct that major economies in Europe are showing a slowdown, clearly we talked about the issues affecting the automotive sector and really the impact on our customers in terms of their spending habits the point is we\u2019re pretty diversified globally, we\u2019re still seeing growth opportunities in all of these markets and I think as we\u2019ve said in the past we see a lot of market sectors within these economies that were relatively un-penetrated by us in the past so there\u2019s a lot of business out there for us and that\u2019s why we are focusing for example in natural resources and in aviation and some of those other sectors in the commercial side whereas Nick said in the US alone, notwithstanding the economic climate in the US sales improved 25%. ", "Now we\u2019re not communicating that we expect continued 25% growth quarter-over-quarter in the US industrial business, so its sometimes misleading to try to take a macro picture and somehow try to translate it directly into our micro performance because we do see pockets of opportunity and really on a global basis. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Regarding Europe, yes as I said the European economies are slowing down but we tend to be strong in Spain and that\u2019s led the slowdown. So the first and second quarter our businesses took one of the biggest hits associated with the slowdown. A quarter of our business is in Spain and Europe and that, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following that but the construction market in Spain imploded and a lot of the industrial indexes and consumer spending have followed along and we weathered that. ", "So we\u2019re not so\u2014we see some back off in Europe but we\u2019re not so negative about that. The United States of course there are the challenges, fuel prices are probably the biggest thing but if you look back in history what you\u2019ll find is, is that as fuel prices have increased still our vans have seemed to weather pretty well. In 1978 the last time the fuel prices moved in this kind of level, van sales went up reasonably well each year. So we\u2019re not too daunted by this. We think our models are resistant. ", "Then as Martin said, and I think it maybe is not always clear, we have not mined the industrial business as we might have. We like to say we\u2019re finally realizing that we can bring the Snap-on brand out of the garage and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in terms of this 25% growth. It\u2019s not so much capturing more business with existing customers, it\u2019s reaching out to new customers and with that 500 manned direct sales force which is pretty large as direct sales forces go in this sector, we feel pretty confident that that can keep going. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "As we look at energy costs and clearly you were able to offset it for yourself here in terms of Snap-on energy costs, but if you look at the dealer, how big is fuel as a part of his costs and do you see dealers drive fewer miles making fewer stops in environments like this?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Let me not get into specifics but let\u2019s say if the diesel price goes up $1.00 that adds about roughly $0.90, that adds about $100.00 a week\u2014just under $100.00 a week to their gas expenses and we figured out how to offset that with our RCI. We\u2019ve got programs to try to do that and we\u2019re continuing to do more of that. One of the things we\u2019re doing really is turning the RCI engine focused on the franchisees. And as you might expect these are small businessmen, they all do things somewhat differently in a lot of ways and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to improve there.", "So we feel pretty positive about the value of rapid continuous improvement and in some of our innovation processes and bringing down their costs at least for the foreseeable future and keeping them even. Now of course it\u2019s a struggle each quarter, we have to work pretty hard at that. But we feel positive about it. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I don\u2019t think you gave a specific number but your sales of your US dealers were down 4%, how is your dealer performance to the end market?", "Martin Ellen", "The reported sales are down 4% and as we\u2019ve communicated in past calls we didn\u2019t touch on it in our formal remarks, if you eliminate some of the factors that don\u2019t necessarily give you a good indication of sort of flow through the stores for example, the variation in year-over-year sales comparisons for the effect of the one-time sales on the convert trial franchisees to full franchisees which again for the reasons Nick cited, were less this year then last year, you actually take the 4% down to about a negative 1%. ", "We did get some pricing which would make the volume there a little lower then 1% and then if you disaggregate that further across our Snap-on product as compared to our mid tier and RWD you\u2019d find that we had growth in both mid tier and RWD but again a decline in the Snap-on branded products and particularly the higher ticket products that Nick mentioned. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Pricing overall in the quarter what was that for you?", "Martin Ellen", "Pricing overall in the quarter was about 1%--$9 million roughly. ", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "When you look at these un-penetrated markets taking the Snap-on brand beyond the garage, today if I remember correctly non-automotive markets represent about 28%, and is there a way that you could provide a little more granularity of that 28% what the end market exposure is in terms of whether its aviation, energy, etc.", "Nick Pinchuk", "We could think about doing that on a future call, I can tell you that I can granulize the growth rates, the aerospace business grew about 29% in the quarter. Natural resources grew 26%, that kind of thing. Some of those businesses were lower; the vocational training business grew between 5% and 10% so somewhat lower so there\u2019s some of the balance you see in some of those specific markets. The base markets grew at about 11%.", "Martin Ellen", "You know our business; SNA Europe sells predominantly outside automotive, that\u2019s increasingly a global business with respect to a number of their important products including hacksaws and band saws because that\u2019s increasingly being penetrated in Asia. Nick talked about some of the focused markets which are really serviced by our US industrial business and that business today is, the size is approaching 20% of the segment so we\u2019ve got very high growth and opportunity in that portion of the CNI segment. A lot of our Asian business as you know is\u2014there\u2019s automotive end market in that but there\u2019s quite a bit of non-automotive as well. ", "Automotive concentration as you know is predominantly the entire DNI segment as well as the Snap-on tools plus you have equipment. And then the under car equipment business which is roughly a quarter of the CNI segment. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think one of the things you can think of is that the Snap-on US van business now is between 25% and 30% of our overall business. So we\u2019re substantially less dependant on that particular business then we have been in the past. That\u2019s one of the overall messages we have here. ", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "You had made a comment about the hacksaw manufacturing transition from Sweden to China and you had referenced a tough transition, could you expand a little bit there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "When I said tough I don\u2019t want to imply that we had necessarily problems but I think through bitter tears I\u2019ve learned the difficulty of projecting a state of the art technology thousands of miles. And so I think we approached it with the idea it was going to be daunting. The technology we\u2019re using in China in fact is an evolution of what had been used in Sweden so we fundamentally used the Sweden operation as a base, developed a new technology there in terms of machining these hacksaw blades, ordered the products and then started them up in China without having an exact copy base operations in Sweden. ", "So what we have in China today is a hacksaw blade that is manufactured in a more efficient process and is manufactured to higher standards then the particular model that had been manufactured in Sweden at that time. So that\u2019s what I meant by the tough transition. We really didn\u2019t have any major disruptions or anything like that. It was in fact completed on time, on cost and we\u2019re pretty much at sell out right now so we\u2019re looking at expanding. ", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Finally if we look in the remarks its clear the diversification of the portfolio is paying very big dividends in these times, when we look at the margin performance particularly in CNI and DNI in the quarter we\u2019re getting into unchartered territory from what we\u2019ve seen from Snap-on historically and with CNI in particular can you talk about where that business can go longer term?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we believe it will be in the strong mid teens. That\u2019s where we believe it will be. I think it\u2019ll end between 15% and 20% over time. I think we\u2019re discovering things about CNI that we didn\u2019t quite realize. When I ran CNI I don\u2019t think I fully envisioned the runway that\u2019s in the industrial business. We believe this to be a tremendous opportunity and it dawns on us like I tried to communicate in my call is that we are uniquely positioned with the technical knowledge imbedded in that sale force and we have a product that critical buyers value and want. ", "In the past we thought of ourselves as being in the garage. That\u2019s one. Two we understand we have a technical advantage in equipment in our imaging technology. We\u2019re pushing that advantages and the people down there are quite technically enabled and we\u2019re pushing the technical advantage and at the same time our costs are being driven down. The cost of the new model are terrific and yet the benefits to the customer are better then any competition. So we feel pretty good about that. ", "And then SNA Europe is a story of just continual improvement because they had a good business in Baco in tools and we put them together and there\u2019s constant potential for improvement and they\u2019re contiguous to the eastern European markets. When you put all the together I see them going to 15% to 20% in between there someplace. ", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "DNI in terms of, it would seem that ProQuest is having a very pronounced impact in terms of the overall increased profitability of that segment, when we look at the margin potential of that business especially once these OEM contracts lap and we\u2019ve got some top line to leverage what can that business look like?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we feel pretty positive about our positions. We really have two positions in DNI, one is with independent car repair people, the Mitchell and the diagnostics business are fairly strong and our data content is stronger then anybody else in the industry. No one can get better data on wide range of products then we can provide. So we have a great position there. ", "And ProQuest gave us a\u2014greatly expanded our position with OEM dealerships. And ProQuest is fulfilling all our targets when we made the acquisition. Its base business, the electronic parts catalogue business is on target. Its synergies which I think we had for $4 million or $5 million this year are happening so we see that business being, I guess I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on the total number but I see it being somewhat stronger then the other businesses because I think we have some pretty proprietary advantages in that area. ", "Martin Ellen", "Let me just add because we\u2019ve talked in the past about margin expectations for the company as a whole and years ago we talked about a 13% number for 2010, we said earlier we were ahead of that and we were charging to 15% by 2010 and the mix of that would have put as you know diagnostics and information at the high teens or so, then tools and then commercial industrial and I think the one thing we\u2019re seeing is improving commercial industrial margin expansion beyond what maybe we would have thought just a short while ago. ", "And I think if you put that mix together you can easily see how we can get a 15% overall corporate margin. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "Could I just ask about your restructuring cost, you had mentioned $5 million in the CNI segment is that where most of it was? ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes last year we had some major restructuring, some very large formal restructuring in Europe. We closed our [Enchoping] plant and moved it into Spain and moved some production into Spain and others into Eastern Europe and China. So that was driving a big piece of that. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "And that $13 million to $16 million for 2008 most is that is in the CNI?", "Martin Ellen", "Some of it is, its spread across the segment but CNI would still have the majority of it. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "I want to point out that the reduction doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re not doing improvement activities. We are constantly spending money on improvement activities that don\u2019t meet the formal description of our classification around restructuring so I think if anything, what you\u2019ve seen this year is a little bit of a migration from the big bang items like Johnson City and [Enchoping] closing which happened last year to more individual items that just don\u2019t meet the classification and restructuring and are being spent in the operations and absorbed and not called out as restructuring. ", "And we\u2019re seeing that benefit in terms of the performance improvements year-over-year. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "So in 2009 would you expect that to be lower or higher, I\u2019m getting at that as a measure of your discovery of additional opportunities for improving efficiency, is that running down a little bit, you\u2019re getting to the point where you found a lot of the big improvement potential?", "Martin Ellen", "First of all we don\u2019t have a clear view yet on 2009 but I think as Nick said at some point the major actions in terms of the major plant consolidations are fairly well behind us and I don\u2019t think anybody would have expected us to spend the $20 million or $25 million a year indefinitely that had been our history so I think you\u2019re now starting to see the decline reflecting just what Nick said which is as he said a lot of the big bangs are behind us. We continue to look for improvements every day and some of those will result in restructuring but I don\u2019t think any of us thought we would spend $20 million to $25 million a year. There\u2019s just not that many plants to consolidate and other physical improvements to be made where a lot of those charges result. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "But it sounds like you\u2019re switching the emphasis of that going forward to the Snap-on tool part of the business. ", "Martin Ellen", "We\u2019re switching it there and everywhere. I don\u2019t want anybody to think, we\u2019re doing more RCI every day and I think that\u2019s coming through clearly in the numbers particularly this quarter so don\u2019t read the trend in restructuring spending as any indication as to the level of RCI activity because that would not be correct. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "It has been an important part of your upside operating leverage as you\u2019ve been showing particularly when the sales growth was a little slower. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "That\u2019s true but if you look at commercial industrial for example if you adjust for currency and lower restructuring they still grew at 30% year-over-year so that\u2019s still pretty good performance leverage I think\u2014without that adjustment. I think it would be wrong to think that we are switching our emphasis to the tools group in any way. Simply this, when you close a major plant in Europe its big bucks and so when you don\u2019t do that it tends to reduce your numbers somewhat. ", "I would think that I would see us spending $10 million to $15 million for awhile because we do see continual opportunities going forward. Its just that we also are seeing the small opportunities as well and one of the things that happens with this rapid continuous improvement that I found here is that when you first start it you kind of tend to focus on the big opportunities but as it tends to wend its way through the organization those kernels of improvement that are down in various departments and locations find opportunities to improve. And we\u2019re seeing some of that this year. ", "So even with lower restructuring spending we\u2019re seeing substantial performance improvement. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "There were a lot of questions on Europe and you did the major restructuring in 2007 do you still see currently and going forward more benefits leveraging benefits still to be seen from the major restructuring that you already had?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes sir. We haven\u2019t seen it all. I can assure you. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "And you talked about being hit in Spain and Italy is pretty weak too--", "Nick Pinchuk", "Italy is pretty weak but we\u2019re not that\u2014Italy is a big country but not so strong for us. Spain is a strong country for us. So the fact that Spain was on the leading edge of some weakness in the economics gave us a problem and we overcame it. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "In the tool business Snap-on tool van business it sounds like your weakness more is due to capital spending decisions on big tool storage and diagnostics, but I would expect that your hand tool business would have held up better particularly you\u2019ve got higher on time delivery which probably should have added to sales and you had RWD that should still be adding to sales growth, is there something I\u2019m missing there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, our hand and power tool business which is the productivity improvement business held up pretty well. Its just we took a pretty big ding in the tool storage and the big ticket items. To me its pretty logical is that what happens is, is that you know the guys decide well its tougher times, its uncertain times, maybe I\u2019ll get along without that toolbox. But they do buy our wrenches. And they do buy our power tools, particularly the power tools, the power tools had a dynamite quarter. ", "So what you\u2019re seeing coming out of that same store sales is just the balance of that mix. ", "Alexander Paris \u2013 Barrington Research Associates", "So that would imply then that it\u2019s the tech reps who maybe sell even more expensive equipment directly to the dealers then that should have been very weak then. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes that was somewhat weaker yes. We do have some less expensive diagnostics which go through that channel and they sold pretty well. ", "Operator", "Your final question is a follow-up from the line of David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "In your commercial business how are the equipment sales going for the auto repair market?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well equipment sales, up slightly but not like we\u2019d like it. It\u2019s being hurt by the capital expenditures restructuring so in the quarter it was up very slightly. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "You would expect that to slow down though with this capital spending, or not.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think so, I think\u2014I have confidence in our technology. We think we can instigate replacement because our technology is better. I think it was up, excluding currency, equipment was up 2% or 3%. That\u2019s what I mean by slightly. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "So only on facilitation business, where does that stand right now in terms of size and\u2014is there more there to run off, I know you made the comment that the impact is going to be more moderate. ", "Martin Ellen", "For the first half of this year we had a negative comparison of $19 million mostly because of the one major program in the US and the program in Europe, as I said in my prepared remarks we expect the comparison to be substantially more favorable and I\u2019ll interpret that to mean sort of a flattish comparison with respect to EOM programs. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "What\u2019s the size of this business now?", "Martin Ellen", "The size of this business now again if you sort of look at their core business the ongoing business, exclude the programs it\u2019s a business that will run $30 million to $35 million a quarter that\u2019s without the program business. I can look over this year and last year and tell you that you can have quarters in the program business in the $5 million range and believe it or not you can have program quarters of $25 million at least in terms of the last couple of years, that\u2019s the kind of variation extremes you can see. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "With regard to that business the facilitation business I think you understand is kind of the base, the programs\u2014we see a couple of programs coming on that we feel pretty optimistic about in that area so its not like we think that business is a bad business or anything or we\u2019re thinking about pulling back on that just because the two programs have wound down. We just didn\u2019t do the best job of getting programs in the pipeline to make up for those two or three contracts that are causing some disruption now. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Are there any changes in the competitive landscape that you\u2019re seeing these days, overall?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No I don\u2019t think so. I think though that we are seeing\u2014with regard to the equipment business we are seeing the winning of our technology. We are starting to see a substantial improvement in the wheel service area in terms of alignment, and in terms of balancers and tire changers such that we believe we are gaining substantial share in that area. That\u2019s one. Two, I think you\u2019d have to conclude that we\u2019re gaining share however you contrive share in the industrial segment. ", "It\u2019s kind of hard to do that because it\u2019s such a large segment. So we\u2019re pushing people out in that segment and we\u2019re winning against some of our major competitors there. So those two businesses I think we\u2019re seeing a pretty good improvement in our position. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Do you think in the dealer hand tool business share is going up or down?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Our data says that our share is flat in the quarter but I think we\u2019ve learned to keep our powder dry about that and to take a look at it on an annual basis as opposed to a quarterly basis because of the imprecision of the reporting. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Where are you in your rollout and penetration of the RWS and the mid tier product lineups, how long does that continue to be a positive for you?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well I think for some time, for the foreseeable future because we keep adding to that lineup our franchisees as we talk to our franchisees, and we\u2019re bringing the franchisee group together in Las Vegas again this year, I think we\u2019ll have two-thirds of the US franchisees in Las Vegas with us, and we get ideas from them about adding lineup to the RWD product lines so I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to see that abate for awhile. It may reduce in terms of numbers, amount of increase, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to see the growth abate or go away. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And what about in the mid tier products?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Mid tier was up about a percent this year, maybe a half a percent, I would say maybe another three-quarters of improvement in that area\u2014I mean three fiscal quarters of expansion in that area and we\u2019ll be finished. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk about the credit environment and what you\u2019re seeing, what your customers are seeing?", "Martin Ellen", "I assume you\u2019re referring to our Snap-on credit business; the portfolio there actually is performing still very well. We watched delinquencies closely and if you go over the last year actually our 30 plus delinquencies are actually only up about three basis points from September. They were actually higher in December and they\u2019ve actually come down since December both in terms of 30 plus delinquent accounts and 60 plus delinquent accounts. ", "The portfolio still performs very, very well. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "As an outsider who came to this business that portion of the business only 18 months ago, I\u2019m pretty pleased with what I see. I think our sound bite is we\u2019ve been in this kind of business for a long time and so we\u2019ve been able to manage what ordinary people would say might be not necessarily the best credit risks and we\u2019ve managed it well and our businesses have actually improved in quarter-to-quarter in terms of delinquencies that when the rest of the world has gotten worse. ", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And you\u2019re not really putting loans out there that are worth more then the product you\u2019re selling either.", "Nick Pinchuk", "No I don\u2019t think so, but we have a terrific touch with the customer. ", "Operator", "", "At this time we have no further questions; I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ellen for any addition or closing remarks. ", "Martin Ellen", "Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Good day.

Baird ", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "", "", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 2008 third quarter results conference call hosted by Snap-on Incorporated. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Marty Ellen, Chief Financial Officer.", "Martin Ellen", "Thank you Sean, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s third quarter 2008 results.", "By now you should have seen our press release issued this morning. Despite increased challenges in the economy, we believe that our third quarter results demonstrate our continued progress in our core strategic and operating initiatives. We\u2019ll discuss these with you today.", "Joining me is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s President and CEO. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our business and results. I will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results and afterwards, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website, along with a transcript of today\u2019s call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "This call is copyrighted material by Snap-on Incorporated. It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience. Therefore it cannot be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-on\u2019s expressed permission. With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick. ", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Marty. It appears we live in interesting times. Uncertainty seems to be the order of the day, and of course, Snap-on is not immune. What you can still depend on is that enabling solutions, real products for critical jobs, continue to be in demand, even now, and that\u2019s what Snap-on is all about. ", "What\u2019s also reliable, even in these times, is the strength of our corporation\u2019s business model; the breadth of our customers; the power of our value creating processes, and most importantly, the capability and commitment of our team. ", "In this past quarter, those extraordinary characteristics were on display again. Sales growth was a lot tougher but the strength of our brands and the pull of our new innovative products provided what I think was significant buoyancy. All of that combined to create record earnings for the quarter.", "Operating margins expanded 170 points to over 12%. The EPS of $0.94 is a record for any third quarter, any time in the history of our corporation, and for the nine months completed so far this year, operating margins reached 13%. ", "Those of you who have been listening to us for some time might recall that this was the very goal we set for ourselves a couple of years ago. It was a goal we thought would be achieved, but we thought it would be achieved in 2010. We\u2019re ahead of our own targets, despite the macroeconomic difficulties.", "Now I\u2019ll be giving you some more specifics as we go forward, but before I do, I want to note that we could not have accomplished this past quarter\u2019s performance without the extraordinary efforts of all our associates and franchisees. ", "I know many of you are listening in today to what is your call. My congratulations and my thanks to each and every one of you. It\u2019s clear that these are turbulent times. There is significant uncertainty for both businesses and individuals. As I\u2019ve said many times, Snap-on is not immune.", "We\u2019re fully aware of the difficulties and we\u2019re vigilant regarding the potential impact and the need to act against the eventualities. But having said that, we believe our strategies and business models do create resiliency. ", "We have a growing global position with an expanding presence in emerging markets. We benefit from a diverse set of professional users in critical industries from vehicle repair to aerospace to natural resources to alternate energy. ", "Those are fairly favorable places to be in difficult times, places where Snap-on products fill crucial needs, enhance productivity, and in the end make money for our customers. ", "Beyond that we hold some of the strongest brand positions anywhere. Underpinning all of this, is our value creation approach with differentiating processes like Rapid Continuous Improvement, enabling innovation and passionate customer care.", "So having said that as an overview, let me give you some highlights of our results. This year for the nine months, almost 45% of our sales were outside the U.S. That compares to about 42% for the same period just a year ago.", "About 8% of our global sales, are now in the emerging markets of Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe. If you look at international in a broad sense, the slowdown of Western European economies and the generally tighter credit conditions did make it even more challenging this quarter for both our SNA Europe tools business and for our European based equipment operations, but the rest of our international businesses remained strong contributors throughout the period. ", "Even a casual attention to the media I think today would lead you to question the global economy. We still see opportunity and runway. We\u2019re continuing to invest in emerging markets.", "Progress continues on our third plant expansion in Kunshan, China. We\u2019re already producing power tools and under-car equipment and hacksaws in that location. ", "Now we\u2019re adding a third facility, supporting new products for Asia like band saws and tool storage. We\u2019re continuing on schedule with that project and we expect to be up and running in about six months for both of those product lines. ", "The first quarter acquisition of our 60% interest in Wanda Snap-on is also proceeding well. That new venture is providing what I consider to be high-quality hot-forged hand tool capacity for our markets throughout the world.", "Let\u2019s talk for a moment about Eastern Europe. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve highlighted that region as much as we might have, but we continue to see growth opportunities in those unclaimed markets, and we\u2019re moving forward successfully with the relocation of our plant in Belarus. ", "I think I mentioned in the last quarter that that facility makes important cutting tools and they are low-cost and very high quality. So we\u2019re looking forward to expanding those capabilities as we go forward. ", "Eastern Europe is a strategic growth region for us. Sales there are starting to be significant and they grew in the quarter by almost double digits and that\u2019s excluding currency. We\u2019re excited about the growth prospects in Eastern Europe and we\u2019re going to keep investing. ", "Overall about emerging markets there\u2019s still an awful lot for us to achieve; we\u2019re only scratching the surface. So we\u2019re going to keep investing, keep pursuing opportunities aggressively.", "Now turning to slide 6, let\u2019s talk about our markets and our customer base. We feel we\u2019re in an encouraging position. For vehicle repair technicians: remember, they are served by our Snap-on tools distribution channel, the van. ", "With those customers we remain the leader, the aspirational brand of choice; this is clear. That\u2019s a relatively long wave segment. At this point we see a mixture of both headwinds and tailwinds. ", "For example, fuel prices have begun to decline. That\u2019s probably the one bright spot in the macroeconomic situation. But that will lower cost for our franchisees and will possibly dampen what we\u2019ve seen to be the downward trend in miles driven. ", "But in addition for that segment, government data through August continues to report an increase in household spending on vehicle repair. I guess that\u2019s not surprising given the dramatic decline in new car sales.", "Think of it this way: as I believe I\u2019ve said before, almost 40% of the car park in the United States is now older than 10 years and it\u2019s getting older. So increased spending on repair seems logical, it seems right. ", "Beyond the vehicle age, I also think we must consider that much of U.S. driving is not discretionary. With the non-discretionary nature of the driving we\u2019d expect repair to remain somewhat resilient, even in the face of economic slowdown and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. ", "With all of that said however, technicians are certainly exposed to the uncertain atmosphere. We expected both technicians and garage owners to be more cautious in their spending and it\u2019s played out, it appears to be so.", "It\u2019s not a surprise that the sales of higher priced tool storage products were again soft and the volume of our larger diagnostics products in the United States was down in the third quarter. ", "But overall, technicians are still spending on the innovative tools that make them money. We\u2019ll speak in that context later when we talk about power tools and some of the innovations we\u2019ve brought to the market in that product line. ", "As I said, the U.S. auto market, some headwinds, some tailwinds, but all in all, one of the more reliable segments of the day.", "Let\u2019s talk about the tools group. We\u2019re pleased this quarter that we did have a slight uptick in U.S. van count, both versus 2007 and on a sequential basis versus last quarter. Significantly this is the first year-over-year improvement in some time, so we\u2019re encouraged. ", "But while we\u2019d like to fill the open territories even faster, we\u2019re being selective in recruiting. We believe that\u2019s been the right thing to do. It\u2019s lowered new franchisees\u2019 terminations and reduced termination costs. That\u2019s been a help. Selectivity notwithstanding though, we continue to recruit actively and we expect further increases in van count in the fourth quarter.", "Let\u2019s talk about our franchisees for a minute. We believe the outlook does remain positive. In early August, we had a U.S. franchisee conference in Las Vegas. I spent three days with many of the almost 2000 franchisees attending. Their attitudes were positive and they were quite excited about our new product lineup. In fact future orders from that get together vastly exceeded our expectations. ", "Even in August though, we recognized the need to help the franchisees offset cost pressures. A significant portion of that colloquium was dedicated to raise van efficiencies, dedicated to improving items like fuel costs, selling methods and communications charges.", "The training was as enthusiastic as we\u2019ve seen and we think it\u2019s working and we\u2019re confident it will serve us well going forward. Despite the convention success however, we need to be mindful that more economic uncertainty has arisen since early August. So we are cautious, at least for the fourth quarter for our U.S. franchisee business. ", "While the U.S. business saw a decline in the quarter, the results were very different for the franchisees in Canada, U.K. and other international franchise operations. ", "In those jurisdictions, we achieved growth of almost 10%, driven largely by innovation, a number of new product launches in areas like diagnostics and power tools; all of them had significant success in moving the technicians to purchase.", "Let\u2019s talk about our industrial business. Our focus remains on critical customer segments like the military, aerospace, natural resources, alternate energy and automotive vocational training. ", "We\u2019re rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage and it\u2019s working. Growth did slow from 21% last quarter to about 3% the past period, but year-to-date it\u2019s 14% and we believe the variation over the last two quarters was influenced strongly by customer order timing and a strike at one of our large customers. ", "Order activity for industrial is now very strong, so we expect a return to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re positioning to serve the tool storage and control needs of great opportunities like the expanding natural resources sector and the new major airframes being introduced around the world.", "We continue to invest in industrial product and resources to support that business and we see abundant runway going forward in that area and we\u2019re going to take full advantage; we\u2019re determined to do it. ", "Two of the more challenged businesses in the quarter were our European tools business and our worldwide equipment business. At SNA Europe, while the market coverage is fairly broad based across Europe, the operation has some concentration in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain where sales declined in the quarter by 20%. ", "While the economic conditions have slowed throughout the region, Spain has been weaker than most and that\u2019s resulted in a challenge for SNA Europe.", "In the global equipment business, which sells larger priced capital goods, sales were down 5% without currency. That\u2019s not unexpected in this tight credit environment. ", "But even though the sales environment has become more challenging, we\u2019re continuing to advance our technologies. Over the last few years product innovation has been the key to significant improvements we\u2019ve see in equipment and that\u2019s continuing.", "In this past quarter we introduced our Prism imaging alignment system, which won Motor Magazine\u2019s Top 20 Tools award. Sales by Prism are exceeding expectations despite the overall downturn and volume in the bellwether imaging aligner category for equipment was up significantly. ", "In equipment, we are continuing to innovate and as a result we\u2019re advancing penetration of our targeted key accounts and despite the softness, we believe we\u2019re gaining market share although it is in a weak market.", "Also in the C&I segment, let me talk for a moment about automotive power tools. They had a terrific quarter and it aided the franchise business significantly. Sales improved almost 34% and this is just another innovation story. ", "Our new NG725 pneumatic impact wrench and our CT4410 cordless impact, both are power to weight leaders and have and continue to be enormous successes. As with our equipment business, power tools has had a string of successful new product launches and we have a solid pipeline of new products coming to us over the next few quarters.", "We\u2019ve consistently said for technicians, power tools are an essential purchase. They translate into immediate productivity and therefore will do well even in a softer environment; so far this appears to be the case.", "The diagnostics and information group also had an encouraging quarter, considering the market for bigger ticket items. The European diagnostics business expanded in the period and our OEM facilitation won an essential tool deployment in North America that significantly aided its third quarter.", "Now while business solutions sales did decline, much of that was expected as a result of exiting small peripheral lines of business. Activity in the SBS, the Snap-on business solutions core, however was favorable in the quarter.", "In total, for the diagnostics and information group from a profitability perspective, that organization achieved an operating margin of 17.5% and the profits represented a growth of over 20% for the quarter.", "Now let\u2019s turn to slide 7. I think this is important because it\u2019s authored our success for many quarters: we continue to drive improvement across our business. We drive it with a suite of strong and critical processes; we call those activities Snap-on value creations. That helped author our third quarter and it will drive further improvement going forward; we are confident. ", "I\u2019ve already mentioned a few of the innovations; there are many more across all the businesses. But we\u2019re going to keep investing in innovation. In fact next month we\u2019ll be opening another Snap-on Innovation Center, right here in Kenosha. We call it the Snap-on Innovation Works. ", "It will include areas to observe customers interacting with products; a modern auto repair garage; space for both two and three-dimensional prototyping; and an area specifically devoted to the critical industries I talked about before.", "I look forward to many of you visiting and when you do, you\u2019re going to get a first hand view of Snap-on innovation taking shape.", "Another process that\u2019s important to us and crucial to us is rapid continuous improvement or RCI. It\u2019s played a major role in our progress. We see its results almost everywhere, from manufacturing to administration to product design. ", "For example, our COT in our U.S. distribution business continues to perform in the mid-90s range, and while that\u2019s good and much improved over just a short time ago, we need to make it better and we will.", "From a productivity viewpoint, RCI has enabled us to raise sales for associates by over 8%. In the past quarter, we did see more than $10 million of commodity cost inflation. Those increases were substantial, but they were more than offset by our RCI activities. ", "While the commodity price increases are softening going forward, we still feel, I believe, that fourth quarter costs for steel freight packaging and other items will increase by about $12 million. But we\u2019re confident that we can achieve offsets through RCI just as we\u2019ve done so far.", "While economic difficulties clearly increased in the third quarter, I think you can say that the Snap-on team met those challenges and prevailed. Sales were tougher to come by, but we continue to seize opportunities in those places where growth was made available by our diversification. ", "We continue to innovate, stimulating demand, even in the face of economic weakness. We continue to aggressively deploy RCI, further improving processes and reducing costs.", "While inventories have risen somewhat, there were clear purposes for that positioning. We believe that some of that paid off in capturing additional businesses in emerging markets and with selective customers. That drove up our return on capital. ", "Having said that though, some was aimed at sales that didn\u2019t materialize and we\u2019ll begin correcting for that in the fourth quarter. As I said, the fourth quarter was a strong quarter. Our business models, our brand, our innovation, prevailed in economic difficulties.", "Now I have Marty here to give you some of the details.", "Martin Ellen", "Thanks, Nick. Turning to slide 9, net sales of $698 million in the quarter were up 2.5% from last year; without currency, sales were up just under 1%. Clearly, this was a much tougher quarter in terms of sales growth. ", "In the U.S., sales were up 1.3%. Our U.S. franchisee business, comprising 26% of this quarter\u2019s sales, was down three tenths of 1%. Our U.S. industrial business grew 2.8% in the quarter, substantially less than the 21% growth last quarter. ", "We believe a substantial amount of this variation over the last two quarters resulted from timing of customer order activity. We believe this business will return to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter.", "In Asia-Pacific and the developing economies of Eastern Europe, which comprised about 8% of sales, reported growth was relatively robust at 15.3%, and it was 9.1% without currency. ", "However, in Western Europe, which comprised about 27% of this quarter\u2019s sales, our commercial and industrial tools and under-car equipment businesses faced increased head winds due to the slowing economies. ", "Spain and Italy have experienced some of the more severe slowdowns and our SNA Europe tools business does have some concentration of its business in these countries. ", "As many of you already know our equipment business, which sells more expensive capital equipment and has a reasonable presence in Europe, faced the challenges of not only economic slowdown, but tighter credit conditions. ", "A continuing bright spot in Europe is our U.K. franchisee business, which had another solid quarter reporting 13.5% growth without currency.", "Consolidated gross profit of $312 million represented 44.7% of sales and improved 50 basis points over last year. Higher price realization along with $5.2 million of benefits from RCI initiatives more than covered steel, freight and other product cost inflation. ", "Partially offsetting these improvements in gross margin was less favorable U.S. sales mix in the Snap-on tools group. Lower restructuring costs this year of $2.2 million also benefited the gross margin rate. ", "Operating expenses of $230.6 million in the quarter declined to 33% of sales compared to 34.4% last year. Major cost improvements were achieved through $6.4 million of benefits from ongoing RCI initiatives and $2.6 million of lower franchisee termination costs.", "Financial services contributed $4.8 million of operating income, compared to $5.6 million last year. I will cover financial services in more detail in a moment.", "Operating earnings of $86.4 million for the quarter were up 19.3% over last year. As a percent of total revenues, operating earnings improved to 12.1%, up 170 basis points from the 10.4% earned a year ago. ", "For the nine months this year, we achieved an operating margin of 13% and believe we have opportunities for further margin expansion.", "Interest expense in the quarter is down $4.8 million from 2007, primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels. With the recent rise in short-term interest rates, we expect interest expense will be about $8.5 million in the fourth quarter.", "Our effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests is 33.3% in the third quarter and we anticipate that for the full-year we will remain at this rate. Diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the quarter were up 34.3% from the $0.70 earned last year.", "With that as a consolidated summary, I will now turn to our segment results starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide 10. Segment sales of $338.1 million in the quarter were up $10.2 million or 3.1% over 2007. ", "As I just mentioned, our European tools and worldwide equipment businesses experienced sales declines. Those larger businesses on a combined basis had relatively flat reported sales, but growth was down 5.6% on a constant currency basis. ", "However higher sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to U.S. industrial customers, increased sales of power tools and continued growth in Asia and in Eastern Europe resulted in an overall reported segment sales increase of 3.1% and a less than 1% decline without currency.", "Notwithstanding the challenging sales environment, third quarter operating earnings of $40.7 million for the segment were up 24.5% from prior year levels, including $4.9 million of savings from RCI and cost reduction initiatives, along with contributions from higher pricing. ", "Restructuring costs were lower by $1 million. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the C&I segment improved 200 basis points in the quarter to 12% from 10% last year.", "Turning now to slide 11, the Snap-on tools group reported third quarter sales of $269.5 million, which was up $7.5 million, or 2.9% from last year. The group\u2019s international operations again reported double-digit growth, and despite the continued economic headwinds in the U.S., sales in our U.S. franchise operations [audio gap] relatively relatively flat; as I said, down three-tenths of 1%, while van count actually improved slightly both on a sequential and year-over-year basis.", "Third quarter operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group grew 14.6% from last year. Operating earnings benefited from the higher international sales volumes, but this was tempered by a less favorable U.S. product sales mix. ", "Pricing improvements, net of commodity cost increases were about neutral for the quarter. Operating earnings improved as a result of $2.6 million of RCI savings and $2.6 million of lower franchisee termination costs, consistent with the lower level of franchisee terminations. ", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings in the quarter improved to 10.5% of sales, compared to 9.4% last year.", "For the diagnostics and information group, which is shown on slide 12, third quarter sales of $155.1 million were up $3.1 million from prior year. Our OEM facilitation business in North America fulfilled an essential tool program in the quarter. ", "We also achieved increased sales of diagnostics products in Europe, and higher sales of Mitchell 1 information products. These increases were partially offset by lower U.S. sales of diagnostics and lower activity of Snap-on business solutions resulting from the planned exit of certain non-core business product lines.", "Operating earnings of $27.2 million for the segment improved $5 million or 22.5% from 2007, primarily due to $4.1 million of savings from RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in the quarter improved 290 basis points year-over-year from 14.6% last year to 17.5% this year.", "Turning to slide 13, financial services revenues increased nearly 14% year-over-year on higher originations and, in our U.S. Snap-on credit business, revenue growth was aided by an approximate 180 basis point reduction in the year-over-year discount rate on extended credit contracts sold. ", "Many of you have recently asked about the credit quality of the portfolio of Snap-on credit loans to technicians. Let me give you some additional data and trends. Accounts 60 plus days delinquent, at the end of September were about 1.9%. At the end of 2007 and 2006 they were about 2%. ", "The high water mark was about 3% at the end of 2005: not reflective of credit deterioration, but of higher franchisee turnover and consolidation of Snap-on Credit\u2019s field organization. ", "For years prior to 2005 and going all the way back to 2001, the highest level experienced was about 2.2%. We believe this demonstrates the discipline, strength, and tight integration of our Snap-on Credit and franchisee distribution businesses. ", "While operating earnings in financial services were down year-over-year for the quarter, this had nothing to do with their core credit operations. We incurred $1.4 million of one-time expenses primarily related to an information systems project.", "Let me turn to a brief discussion of our balance sheet and cash flow. As seen on slide 14, our accounts receivable increased $19.3 million from year-end levels, primarily due to higher levels of sales and receivables outside of the United States. ", "Notwithstanding generally longer payment terms outside the U.S., days sales outstanding of 73 days was equal to last year. All of our businesses are being extra vigilant in managing customer credit in this environment.", "Inventory performance has been somewhat disappointing with inventory turns declining from 4.9 times at last year-end, to 4.5 times currently. Of the nearly $66 million inventory increase over the nine-month period, we believe about $20 million or so is the result of lower than expected sales. ", "The remainder includes higher material and other cost increases, planned builds ahead of certain production line relocations, and some seasonal build for school programs and other specific fourth-quarter sales initiatives.", "As Nick said, we\u2019ve already begun addressing this inventory position and even with the added level of working investment, pre-tax return on invested capital continues to improve. ", "For the trailing 12-month period ended September, it was 22%, and for all of calendar year 2007, it was about 20%. For the comparable September 2007 period it was 18.4%. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter is $397.6 million. Our net debt to total capital of 22.4% is down from 24.9% at year-end 2007.", "Our liquidity position remains strong. Besides the cash flow generated from operations, we currently maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility provided by a strong diversified group of international banks and another $20 million of committed bank lines. ", "All $520 million of this borrowing capacity is not presently used and our revolver does not expire until August 2012. Our current A2/[P-1] short-term credit rating also allows us to access the commercial paper market should we need to do so. We presently have no commercial paper outstanding.", "Turning to slide 15, cash provided by operating activities was $20.4 million, or $39 million lower than the third quarter last year. The primary reason for this decline relates to the inventory build I just mentioned, which amounted to about $23 million for the quarter, as well as other timing differences primarily related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities.", "This concludes my remarks on our third-quarter performance. I\u2019d like to briefly review with you some financial considerations for the balance of 2008, which are shown on slide 16.", "Regarding full-year 2008, we expect to continue to invest on our growth initiatives, including further investments in Asia and other global emerging markets, while aggressively managing cost. ", "We also expect to continue implementing our other strategic and RCI initiatives intended to enable higher levels of growth and profitability. We anticipate full-year 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of $12 to $14 million and we expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $60 to $65 million. ", "As I said, we also expect our 2008 effective income tax rate to approximate 33.3%. Finally, we expect earnings will improve over 2007 levels for the balance of the year.", "Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. ", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks Marty. I\u2019d just like to end by once again noting that the third quarter represented a significant increase in earnings and it was a record despite the difficult environment. ", "I want to once again thank our associates and franchisees for making that happen. Congratulations. I\u2019d also like to end by saying that we\u2019re confident of our business models, of our runway and of our people. ", "Having said that, it\u2019s clear that the current economic volatility has rendered projection I think less certain and so as befits such situations we\u2019re taking action now to reduce costs, to restructure and to accelerate productivity. ", "As I\u2019ve said on practically every call, the opportunities for such improvement on Snap-on are abundant and we\u2019re increasing our emphasis on cost. It\u2019s helped us so far; it will continue to help us in the future. ", "But at the same time, we also continue to see opportunity. Opportunity in emerging markets, in innovative products, and in critical industries; places where working people need real solutions to crucial tasks. So we\u2019re continuing to pursue those opportunities even in these difficult times.", "As we move into the fourth quarter, we know no one has great visibility in this environment. But for Snap-on, we\u2019ll maintain our core strategic initiatives but at the same time, we\u2019re confident we have the flexibility and the options to balance among the areas of sales growth, cost reduction, working capital utilization, and capital investment. ", "We\u2019re confident our operations can create a focus appropriate to the economic and business environment as it unfolds. As a result, we believe that Snap-on can continue its trend of encouraging progress as we go forward to the days and the years ahead.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. ", " ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "", "First question, could you expand a little bit on restructuring? That\u2019s going to come in just a little bit lower than anticipated earlier in the year. How you\u2019re going to approach restructuring as you think about what\u2019s clearly becoming an even more challenging environment?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "A couple of things. One is, we\u2019ve said all along that, yes, our formal restructuring numbers are lower year-over-year but we have a number of smaller actions which have served us well in productivity and cost reduction that don\u2019t necessarily qualify for restructuring in the classical sense and that\u2019s driven our cost reduction going forward. ", "If you look at our numbers going into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to look hard at the capacity of our facilities and improving administration in terms of productivity. I think it\u2019s just doing Jim, what we\u2019ve been doing all along. ", "If you look at our numbers, we\u2019ve been making some pretty good headway out of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say flat sales, but modest sales increases. I think you\u2019re going to see us doing that forward and I think going forward, I think the only thing about this current situation is we kind of got our alert up about trying to make sure that we match our capacity and our capabilities to the volumes as we see them.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Okay. Fair enough; that\u2019s exactly the point I was looking for \u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think you\u2019re going to see us taking a look at plants; you\u2019re going to see us look at lot of things, but it\u2019s not so much different than we\u2019ve done before, maybe we ratcheted it up because of the current economic uncertainty. I think we stand on our record of improving costs over the last several quarters.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Okay. And you made a comment in your closing remark about working people seeking solutions to real tasks and you know specifically one of the areas that\u2019s gotten a lot of focus through earnings season was the credit crunch and what\u2019s happened over the last, essentially, month. ", "When you look at your industrial markets and you look on both the tools and the equipment side, what impact has credit or lack of credit access had on that business and just any commentary about near-term trends there.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Let me parse between it. We haven\u2019t really seen a lot of impact in the industrial business. Generally we\u2019re in industries where these are critical industries that seem to be going forward and I think I\u2019ve stated that with the order rates have remained strong. ", "So we feel pretty good about that runway. If you want to expand it to some of the other businesses, I think we said the equipment business; they have some challenges associated with the capital investments in some of their areas. They were down, I think, excluding currency, 5% in the quarter and that\u2019s directly traceable to this. ", "In the tools business, we see the same kinds of things with big-ticket items: big tool storage equipment, big diagnostics. Having said that, though, the message of the call I think was for equipment and for the tool side, innovation is selling; those two power tools are great tools and they are selling. ", "The Prism new aligner is selling; the imaging aligner business is up substantially because of that. Some of our other product is off, you might say even further, but in fact we believe as we see our new products roll out and we look at our pipeline and feel pretty good about it, it impels purchase even in this difficult time.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Okay. And two final unrelated questions. First, any commentary on pension as you look at that going forward and secondly with the strengthening dollar, you\u2019ve had a nice tailwind on translation for quite some time; what impact do you see FX have going forward?", "Martin Ellen", "First of all on pension, I can give you the data we have as of the end of September. Given pension asset values mark-to-market as of September 30, and everybody should recall that our funding policy over the past years has pretty much been and our cash flow has allowed us to fund to the PBO level, our biggest funded plan being in the U.S. ", "But given current asset values, but at the same time, an increase in the liability discount rate, again, looking at that rate at the end of September all these valuations will have to be redone at the end of December, but if we just take that point in time, we are modestly over funded on a PBO basis; meaning we don\u2019t foresee making any pension contributions.", "Second question on currency rates; no question the dollar has strengthened. I\u2019ll just pick the euro for example, last year in the fourth quarter, the average rate that drove our P&L was about $1.45. I think yesterday I\u2019ll say $1.32, so clearly the dollar strengthened and you see that across the Pound and in the Canadian Dollar and the Swedish Kroner which are the more important currencies for us. ", "That being said, when you look at the overall impact of both translation, which by the way added very little to this quarter, a few hundred thousand dollars; but also the transactional exposures that result from us having, for various of our businesses, the cost base in, say, Europe and in sales in dollars outside Europe, or vice versa like in the tools group that makes a lot of product in the U.S., that gets exported into markets in Europe.", "The effect has been relatively neutral, in fact in this quarter, when you take translation and transaction, I think the effect on operating income was negative, about $1.5 million. The effect of the strengthening dollar, will it erode reported dollar sales vis-\u00e0-vis last year? Not clear to us it\u2019s going to have a significant impact given our global model in terms of operating profits.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Okay. Great. Thank you for the clarity.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Alexander Paris - Barrington Research.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Hi, good morning, nice quarter again.", "Martin Ellen", "Thanks Alex.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "You\u2019re doing a great job on costs obviously, and sales is still dragging a bit and I would imagine that even though you\u2019ve got some good potential ahead for more cost-cutting, I\u2019m just wondering, you want to get your sales up; it sounds like Eastern Europe and China are the expectations for the biggest source of growth, is that right?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, no. Those are two places which are very strong for us, but I think I would also offer that the whole industrial sector is a big area. We see that being pretty strong. That rides on two things, I think Alex: one is the critical industries that we refer to, things like aerospace, oil and gas, and natural resources and the like are continuing to be reasonably robust and there is demand. ", "Secondly, we\u2019re gaining share because pretty much the Snap-on brand was trapped in the garage for a long time. So we\u2019re rolling it out of the garage and it\u2019s capturing the attention of quite a few users. We believe pretty clearly that we continue to gain share in that sector.", "You could say the four big drivers would be, sure the emerging markets, Eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific; two, critical industries; and three \u2013 and I want to emphasize this \u2013 innovation, because in this market, innovation is still selling. ", "To our customers, innovation is still selling. We saw that with the 2000 franchisees in August and we saw a number of activities in this past quarter, the Prism is one of them. ", "I could also add based on innovation, we haven\u2019t really unleashed our diagnostics product in Europe yet. The sales there have been relatively small and over the last quarter, we\u2019re starting to unlock some of that potential. I might add diagnostics in Europe to that play. ", "No one can predict where we\u2019re going in this volatility. I think you guys read the same articles and see the same papers that we see. No one can predict it. But I\u2019ve been around the block and there is no group of businesses, no group of business models, no brands, no pipeline of products that I\u2019d rather go to war with than the hand we\u2019re sitting on right now.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Part of the strength in the commercial and industrial, is you\u2019ve added more direct sales ...", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We added in fact in the quarter; I don\u2019t know the exact number, but we\u2019ve added like 25 in the quarter. So other people are contracting, we\u2019re adding, because we believe in that business. Now that may prove to be wrong. But I think that should emphasize some confidence.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "One other question. In the North American dealer, you didn\u2019t give the account. How many vans do you have at the end of the quarter?", "Martin Ellen", "Alex, at the end of the quarter in round numbers we had about 3450.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "It\u2019s up very slightly, but we think it\u2019s a major departure year-over-year from what we\u2019ve been living with.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "But the territories that you have uncovered, if you were very successful in covering them with new people, what would that add?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Roughly 10% of our territories are uncovered and that\u2019s come down a little bit, because we increased a little bit here, but 10% is a good number.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "So you could get another 10% vans without any growth overall in terms of [inaudible]?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We think so and I like our positioning versus our competitors in this marketplace. If you look at the balance between OEM dealerships and independents, our share is stronger in independents. ", "Our franchisees depend less on OEM dealerships than others. So if you think, as some people do \u2013 I\u2019m not prognosticating because that\u2019s difficult in this environment \u2013 if you think that the OEMs are going to reduce by say 800 or 900 rooftops over a period of time, then I think that shifts in our favor. ", "By the way, over that same period of time, U.S. household spending on auto repairs continues to increase; it increased again in August. The repair is going to go some place.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Right.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "And as the OEMs contract, we see the independents ascendant somewhat. We like our positioning in that.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Lower new car sales is a negative in terms of warranty work and so forth but again, that\u2019s probably more than offset by the aging car population?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "And more of that goes to the independent dealers than the OEM?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, and by the way, if you think about it, our data tells us this, the independent dealerships per bay buy more equipment and tools than the OEMs.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Now that you\u2019ve hit your operating margin at 13% a year earlier, do have a new target now?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Actually I think it\u2019s two years early, isn\u2019t it? But anyway, I had to take full credit for something. ", "I think we\u2019ve talked about targeting in these calls from time to time, but I think in this environment I don\u2019t want to get into prediction basis, I think saying that we are going to be up in the fourth quarter in earnings is enough for me.", "Alexander Paris - Barrington Research ", "Okay. Thanks a lot and again great job.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question is from David Leiker - Robert W. Baird.", "Analyst for David Leiker - Robert W. Baird ", "Hi, good morning. This is Keith on the line for David. I just have two quick questions here. If we look at the pace of demand as you exited the quarter, a lot of people are talking about Europe slowing meaningfully towards the end of the quarter. I was just wondering if you could you talk about the pace of each of the businesses as we exited the quarter.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I\u2019ll try to give you some overview. Basically on an overview basis, we had a pretty strong September, actually. The tools group in the United States had a terrific September and they were up year-over-year nicely. So they had a good September; they had a weaker July and August. In this business you get little bit of calendarization around that. But they exited very well. ", "Equipment had an average September; average to the quarter; they had a September that was about the same. If you look at Europe they exited weaker than they entered. I\u2019m talking about SNA Europe now, and the SNA Europe business exited weaker. ", "Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe were both up substantially in September. So they continue to go sort of excelsior, ever upward. Diagnostics and Information had a good September. ", "I think in a broad sense tools was strong; diagnostics was pretty good; international tools was also strong; the C&I group was mixed; SNA Europe was down and industrial had a good September.", "Analyst for David Leiker - Robert W. Baird ", "Perfect. And then if we look to the fourth quarter, with the year-over-year increase in earnings, is this going to be driven more by revenue growth with what\u2019s coming in the normalization in the C&I business or is this more of a margin story in the fourth quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think I really want to specify between that. As I said I think in my remarks, I think we have confidence in our ability to balance between sales growth and cost reduction. We feel pretty good about the cost reductions we see going forward. If we get some revenue growth that will be nice as well, but I think it is very difficult to predict the way in which such a thing that might eventuate in this environment. So I don\u2019t think I will.", "Analyst for David Leiker - Robert W. Baird ", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions on the phone at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Marty Ellen for any additional or closing remarks.", "Martin Ellen", "", "Thank you again everyone for joining us this morning.

Pinchuk - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine", "Operator", "Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2008 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our remarks we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Marty Ellen, Chief Financial Officer, you may begin sir.", "Martin M. Ellen", "Thank you, Ms. Dean and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter 2008 results. By now you should have seen our press release issue this morning. Snap-on reported record earnings for the fourth quarter and the full year. That said, economic headwinds clearly increased during the fourth quarter. And as we enter into 2009, business conditions are clearly more challenging than we anticipated 90 days ago.", "We believe our businesses are reasonably well positioned to weather these challenges and that continued execution of our core business strategies and value added processes will continue to strengthen Snap-on over the long term. Joining me is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's President and CEO. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. I will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results and afterwards we will take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion.

It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience. Therefore, it cannot be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-on's expressed permission.", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Marty. Good morning, everybody. Speaking on the fourth quarter, I would say that we are encouraged by the performance, especially given the macroeconomic challenges of what I would call these very interesting times. I think I've said before that Snap-on is not immune to the difficulties of today. But, we believe that our business models are quite strong and when they are matched with our capable processes, the result is an operation which is resilient, which is positioned well and which can limit the impact of a difficult environment and which can emerge from the difficulties with an expanded strategic advantage.", "And I think we're seeing play out here. I'll highlight some of that as we review the fourth quarter performance. Speaking of fourth quarter, sales were down 10.1%, more than half of that decline was from currency translation resulting from the stronger U.S. dollar, and that change is pretty rapid, it was rapid in fact, primarily in the fourth quarter and with more than 40% of our sales outside the U.S., the impact on Snap-on was significant.", "Excluding currencies, the volume was still down, about 4.5%, I think the exact number is 4.4%. But despite lower sales, operating margins reached 14.2%, our brand positions, our product innovations and the improved processes embedded in the Snap-on way of creating value, all contributed to those profitability gains. And based on that, the earnings per share reached to $1.01, up from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "For the full year, sales were over $2.8 billion, that's an increase that's flat, it's an increase of less than 1%. But operating margin was 13.2%, up 200 basis points from the 11.2 reported last year. And that corresponded to about 20% increase in operating income. EPS for the year reached $4.07, up 26% from 2007. Both the fourth quarter and the full year for 2008 were record performances for Snap-on. I believe they were particularly extraordinary period given the significant headwind.", "And before I go further, it's appropriate to recognize that the brand positions, the business models, the processes, the capable processes and those records would not have been possible without the enormous contributions of our dedicated associates and our loyal franchisees. My congratulations and my thanks to all of you.", "We do believe our broad business models are sound even in these turbulent times. They are advantaged, because they provide unique solutions for serious professionals that are performing critical tasks. And we're extending those models geographically, particularly into emerging markets. And when we combine that strength... that strength of model with Snap-on value creation that is processes aimed at safety, quality, customer care, rapid continuous improvement and innovation, the result is strong, a strong and resilient business that we believe has substantial potential over the long term.", "Of course, we all know times are difficult, but actually we see strategic opportunities in this situation. And we believe we are taking advantage. We've increased share in some of our major customers segments like automotive, technicians and repair shop owners. New customers in industries have been added as we keep extending our Snap-on brand out of the garage. And of course, we build in the emerging markets, where growth opportunities still abound.", "Actually, I believe we are not letting the crisis go to waste. We are making significant advances in each of these areas and we are strengthening our competitive position. At the same time, we know we do face challenges of the economy, everyday we see that. We are working to strike the right balance, aiming to limit the damage, still making the strategic progress that will be decisive, that will be decisive for us as the positive times return.", "For example, given the present uncertainty, we increased our restructuring in the fourth quarter to a total of $6.7 million, that brought the full year to $14.7 million and that's higher than we had previously communicated. We projected those actions will reduce 2009 cost by about $19 million. At the same time, we spent more restructuring money. However, we also accelerated capital expenditures to further expand manufacturing capacity in China and Eastern Europe. We believe those investments are essential for the future.", "We also continue to invest in innovation. In the fourth quarter we completed a Snap-on innovation works here in Kenosha, advanced vehicle repair facilities; two and three dimensional prototyping labs and whole areas specifically devoted to industrial customers in critical industries. We found out now that innovation sells, even in this environment, so we'll continue to invest.", "See we believe, the challenges posed by the current environment don't call for a change in strategy or direction. Rather they require more vigilant balance between growth investments and a need for further cost reductions and that balance is our primary task as we go forward into 2009.", "Now I would like to give you my perspective on the fourth quarter performance across the operating segments.", "We'll start with commercial and industrial. Europe did slow dramatically in the fourth quarter. Overall activity was down 13% and the Southern Europe regions were particularly challenged. Volume in Spain and Italy declined by 30%, a major difficulty and beyond the declines in end-user demand; SNA Europe was also challenged by some level of destalking among its distributors. They faced tight credit controls and they reduced inventory. So we're seeing some difficult conditions in Western Europe.", "In Eastern Europe where we've targeted a number of growth initiatives, sales on a constant currency basis were actually down 3.5%. But we're not discouraged; we believe that Eastern Europe is a continuing opportunity, sales were up almost 9% for the year, backing up that feeling. So we're going to keep building in that important arena.", "Overall, SNA Europe has worked fairly hard improving its cost position, migrating manufacturing from higher cost countries, sourcing more finished products from lower cost regions and our European brands and our market positions remains strong, and the combined with the improved cost position, that should enable us for much better performance as the European market.", "Now let's turn to under-car equipment. That business had a decrease of almost 12.1% in the quarter on the constant currency basis. It's just difficult to sell big ticket, higher price capital goods in this environment. But while the sales declined, we believe our global share is actually improving. In the second quarter, we introduced our most advanced significant productivity advantage over conventional alignment systems. And as a consequence, sales of imaging alignment products were actually... were up double-digits in the fourth quarter.", "We are gaining share in what we think is the strategically decisive alignment segment, and it's based on the innovation like the present. We view that as important progress.", "And as in prior periods, our industrial business continues to expand the Snap-on brand beyond the automotive garage, focusing on the needs of professionals in a variety of critical industries. Sales for that business in the fourth quarter were up 11.2%, with solid double-digit gains across our government, aerospace, alternate energy and educational markets.", "As on a slide, alternate energy appears to be developing into a significant opportunity. Snap-on hosted the initial meeting of the National Wind Energy Training Consortium recently right here in Kenosha. Some at that conference were predicting 180,000 service tax will be needed for wind power over the next several... over the next few years... next several years.", "Now, I noticed today in The New York Times there was an article that said something like though days for green energy. But we believe that over time alternate energy will be a significant business, and we are in on a ground floor, so we feel good about our position in alternate energy. I think some of this section is the extending Snap-on brand to other industries is working well.", "For the full year, our industrial business grew by 13%, showing long-term strength. As I said before, we believe that business has great runway and the sales keep confirming that belief. China and much of the Asia is also experiencing a slowdown. However, many believe that China economy will still grow, mid and maybe high single digits in 2009. And I don't think that's bad given this depth of the global recession.", "So we continue to invest in key capabilities and physicals. Earlier this year, we acquired Hot Forge (ph) hand tool manufacturing capability in our Wanda Snap-on joint venture. We're also expanding our Kunshan saw plant to manufacture ban saws and we're building right now a third plant for tool storage units on the Kunshan site. We know Asia is important and we haven't back dropped one bit. All in all, I am pleased with the progress across commercial and industrial. We are capturing share, we are expanding our capabilities and our margins are expanding.", "Turning to Snap-on Tools segment. Constant currency sales declined 3.1% globally in the fourth quarter. U.S. sales were down 5%. Clearly, our franchisees are being challenged. The technician customers are generally busy, but there're uncertain. They continue to buy essential tools and products, but there're increasingly reluctant to buy a higher priced more discretionary products, like our tool storage units. And I think that trend is going to be with us for the near term.", "In our U.S. franchise system, we did again sequentially grow van count in the quarter, ending the year about flat with 2007 and franchisee turnover in the U.S. remained stable, even with the third quarter and it's lower than a year-ago.", "So I would say our network in this situation is still solid and strong. The big ticket drop, however is a worry, is a challenge. We continue to help our franchisees navigate the difficulties of course and so we're encouraging them to lower inventory levels. And we believe they did in the quarter, improving their breakeven and cash flow and that's going to strengthen them going forward.", "On the cost side, fuel prices are down and we successfully negotiated network wide credit card processing, office supplies and shipping programs that further reduced our franchise costs.", "Recently, I think it's worthwhile to relate that Marty and I and other senior managers attended some of our 2009 regional franchisee kick-off meetings that are held across the country. Franchise attendance in general was good. A number of products and promotional programs were introduced and we spent, a considerable time was spent on business planning, sales and cost management techniques. The most important thing though, was the attitudes of the franchisees were positive. They said that times are difficult, but the corporation's cost management programs are really healthy. They also feel I think significantly that they're gaining on the competition.", "In fact our coverage in the U.S. technician market increased through out 2008 and we believe that our market share rose in the fourth quarter. So Snap-on competitive position is improving. We continue to believe in the longer-term fundamentals of vehicle repair, it's positive. The overall part continues to age with more than 40% of the cars over 10 years old. And while some discretionary repairs maybe postponed in the short-term, and we believe this could be happening. This will only lead to even more repairs in the long-term and our network will be there to take advantage, holding a larger share.", "One final note on the franchisee network. Recently Entrepreneur Magazine recognized Snap-on Tools as number five in home base franchises and 37th overall amongst the 3,500 franchise businesses that they cover. Two years ago, we ranked 61st and more importantly, we now ranked as the number one mobile tool franchise. That recognition is important because it helps attract capable people to Snap-on franchises and it further confirms the strength of our van model.", "In diagnostics and information, constant currency sales were down 5% to 6%, mostly driven by the timing of OEM programs. Earlier this year, I think I've talked about this already. We introduced our new VERUS handheld diagnostic platform as a powerful piece of equipment. It not only contains all of our diagnostics software, but integrates with Mitchell 1 service information. Even at its higher price point, it sold well and that further provides evidence that innovation sells even in tough times.", "Now if you think about diagnostics, I think you'll recognize that Snap-on business solutions and our OEM facilitation group are both directly affected by the auto dealership segment. And while consolidation of U.S. dealerships will have some impact, we do have new business opportunities. We recently signed agreements to develop new electronic price catalogs for Australia and Brazil. We also have expansion opportunities with number of European OEs. And there are OEs who provide their own in-house electronic price catalogs that are now looking to outsource their programs to Snap-on.", "Finally, in the time of lower new car sales, dealerships are looking to expand their backlog with revenue, to expand revenue. Snap-on has just launched a new product that greatly improves their ability to sell that genuine part, those genuine parts in the aftermarket. It's called Namore (ph). We see it as a strong opportunity and so to our dealer customers.", "The auto industry environment is a challenge. But we see long-term opportunities in the repair side of that industry. And we are investing accordingly. So I'll characterize the fourth quarter as encouraging, and the year as well. It's record financial performance, and significant strategic progress on a number of fronts, even in the face of stiffening economic headwinds.", "And now Marty will take us through the financials and when he is done I would like to share some closing thoughts with you as we enter 2009, Marty?", "Martin M. Ellen", "Thanks Nick. I will begin on slide six, Net sales of $668 million declined 10.1% from last year. However, excluding currency translation, sales were down 4.4%. The U.S. dollar rapidly strengthened during the fourth quarter against our key currencies, while strengthened by only 3% against the euro, the dollar strengthened against the pound, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar by 15% or more just in September.", "In the balance of my remarks, any references to percentage changes in sales will be on a currency neutral basis. Looking at sales performance geographically, in the United States, sales declined 1%, with sales in our U.S. franchisee business down 5%. This business comprised 27% of this quarter's global sales. Sales in our U.S. industrial business, however, grew significantly double-digit, up 14.5% in the quarter.", "The declining economic conditions in Western Europe contributed to our 11% sales decline in this geography. Western Europe comprised about 25% of this quarter's global sales. Sales in our European tools and under-car equipment businesses faced increasing headwinds due to the slowing European economies. In our equipment business which sells more expensive capital equipments was again conflicted with the challenges of the economic slow-down as well as tight credit conditions.", "Consolidated gross profit of $300 million in the quarter was down $33.4 million, the reported gross profit margin of 44.9% was flat with last year. However, if we strip out the effects of LIFO inventory valuation which produced a $6 million gain last year, versus $300,000 of expense this year, gross margins on a FIFO basis improved to 45% this year, compared to 44.1% last year. This 90 basis point improvement resulted primarily from a combination of higher pricing, improved productivity and cost savings from RCI and lower year-over-year restructuring.", "These improvements were partially offset by $9.5 million of higher commodity and certain other cost increases. Additionally, fourth quarter manufacturing production slowdowns reduced gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses of $211.4 million in the quarter decreased $33.7 million from 2007, including benefits of $12.6 million from rapid continuous improvement savings, $10.9 million from currency translation and $9.3 million of lower incentive compensation expense.", "Operating expenses in 2008 were also reduced by a $5.4 million adjustment of a contingent liability related to Snap-on business solutions.", "In this comparison, you should note that operating expenses in 2007, benefited from a $4 million gain on the sale of a building in Europe. Financial services contributed $8.9 million of operating income in the quarter, as compared with $8 million, last year. I will financial services in the later slide.", "Operating earnings of $97.5 million, for the quarter were up 1.2%, over the last year. As a percent of total revenues, operating earnings improved to 14.2%, up 160 basis points from the 12.6% earned last year.", "Before I move beyond operating earnings, let me summarize some of the important items affecting the fourth quarter year-over-year operating income comparison.", "In 2008, our recorded operating income included $9.3 million of lower incentive compensation expense and the $5.4 million favorable contingent liability adjustment, I just mentioned. Partially offsetting these increases was $6.4 million of unfavorable currency translation. These three items caused a net improvement and operating earnings of $8.3 million. In 2007, however, our reported operating income included $6 million of LIFO benefits and the $4 million gain on the sale of the facility in Europe, for a net improvement last year of $10 million in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on, interest expense in the quarter was down $2.8 million from 2007, primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our floating rate debt and lower average debt levels in the quarter. Our effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests was 31.9% in the fourth quarter, as compared to 31.2% last year. Diluted earnings per share of $1 in the quarter were up, from $0.98 earned last year.", "With that, I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide seven, segment sales of $326.8 million declined 4.9%, year-over-year before currency. We continue to experience lower sales of professional tools in Europe and lower overall equipments sales worldwide, despite strong double-digit increases in sales of our new imaging aligner products. We also experienced higher sales from industrial customers worldwide and to a lesser extent, increased sales of power tools.", "Gross margin of 37.8% improved 190 basis points from last year as contributions from higher pricing, lower restructuring and rapid continuous improvements more than offset $4.8 million of commodity and other cost inflation. We also had higher cost associated with manufacturing production slowdowns in the quarter. Notwithstanding the weakened sales environment, fourth quarter operating earnings of $39.1 million for the segment increased 2.4% from last year. This includes $9.8 million of savings from RCI along with contributions from higher pricing and $7.3 million of lower restructuring cost.", "The year-over-year comparison was also affected by the 2007 $4 million building gain already mentioned. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings in C&I segment improved 170 basis points in the quarter to 12%.", "Turning now to slide eight. On a worldwide basis, the Snap-on Tools Group reported sales of $252.4 million, down 3.1% without currency. In the U.S., sales were down 5%. Our international franchise businesses including Canada grew slightly about 1%, and van count in the U.S. was up slightly from the third quarter and flat with year-end 2007. After factoring out the affects of restructuring costs, which were $1 million higher this year and the LIFO effects in both years, the gross margin was 42.2% in 2008 and 43.7% in 2007.", "We gained about a 150 basis points of margin improvement through pricing which did offset commodity and other cost inflation. However, mix shift and higher cost associated with slowing production in our plans, lowered the overall gross margin. With respect to operating margin and again factoring out the effects of LIFO and restructuring cost in both periods, the operating margin in 2008 was 9.6%, compared to 11.3% last year. The effects of mix and higher cost due to production slowdowns were the principle reasons for the margin decline.", "Turning to the diagnostics and information group which is shown on slide nine. Fourth quarter sales of $152.9 million declined 5.6% before currency. The largest portion of this decline occurred in our OEM group, due principally to lower program sales in Europe. As we've said in the past, revenue comparisons for the OEMs business are influenced by the timing of these programs. In our worldwide diagnostics business; sales were down less than 1%.", "However, sales in North America were up 2% sales of Mitchell shop management and repair information products were up about 1%. A large portion of the 3.8% decline in sales at business solutions resulted from our exit earlier in the year of certain non-core product lines.", "Operating earnings for the diagnostics and information group of $34.3 million, increased $6.9 million from 2007 levels, including the $5.4 million contingent liability adjustment. Excluding this adjustment, operating earnings in the quarter were up 5.5%, year-over-year. Despite the lower sales, primarily due to $3 million of savings from ongoing rapid continues improvement initiatives.", "As a percentage of sales and again, excluding the $5.4 million adjustment, operating earnings for the D&I group improved 270 basis points year-over-year, from 16.2% last year to 18.9% this year.", "Moving to slide 10. Financial services operating income improved $900,000, originations of about $122 million or $18 million lower than last year due to lower sales of big ticket items sold by our franchisees. As these are the products which tends to get financed through Snap-on credit.", "While origination volume was down, lower discount rates on contracts sold led to the improved earnings. Many of you continue to ask about the credit quality of the portfolio of Snap-on credit loans to technicians. Accounts 60 plus days delinquent at the end of December were about 2.3%. At the end of September they were 1.9%. At the end of 2007 and 2006, they were about 2%. The high water mark was actually was about 3% at the end of 2005 and was mostly due to the consolidation of Snap-on credit steel organization.", "Three years prior to 2005, and going all the way back to 2001; the highest level experienced was about 2.2%. So the recent quarter trend is up, although not unexpected in this environment. This trend also reflects the regional differences we're seeing in our U.S. franchise business.", "The Southeast and Southwest regions of the country, where economic conditions are generally worse, are having the biggest impact on this trend. Both Snap-on credit and our franchisees have always worked diligently to control delinquencies and have heightened their efforts given the current environment.", "Now let me turn to a brief discussion acknowledging cash flow. As seen on slide 11, our accounts receivable decreased $64.8 million from year end levels with $38.6 million of the reported decrease coming from currency translation. Day sales outstanding decreased to 64 days, down from 73 days at the end of the third quarter. All of our businesses are being extra vigilant in managing and monitoring customer accounts and credit risk in this environment.", "Inventory turns declined from 4.9 times at last year end to 4.6 times currently. They were 4.5 times at the end of last quarter. We did extract $10 million of cash out of inventories in the fourth quarter. The combination of inventory increases to support targeted growth opportunities including inventories acquired with our acquisition of Wanda in China, the effects of higher steel and other costs and lower than expected fourth quarter sales, all contributed to our inventory build. Our 2009 plans include inventory reductions.", "Pre-tax return on invested capital continued to improve in 2008. For the year, it was 22.3%, up from 20% last year. Net debt at the end of the quarter of $400 million was down $25 million from the $425 million last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio of 25.2% increased slightly from 24.9% last year. This slight increase occurred as shareholders equity at year-end 2008 was reduced by $130 million due to foreign currency translation and by a $118 million to record an increase in the unfunded liability of our pension and post retirement plans.", "In 2009, we expect to make pension contributions of only approximately 9.5 million and that primarily relates to our foreign plans. Our liquidity position continues to remain strong. Besides the cash flow generated from operations, we currently maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility provided by strong diversified group of international banks, which does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines.", "At the year end the entire $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities our current A2/P2 short term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market, should we need to do so. We presently have no commercial paper outstanding.", "Turning to slide 12, cash provided from operating activities was $46.3 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $20.7 million. For the year Snap-on generated $215 million of cash flow from operating activities and $141 million of free cash flow. Capital spending in the fourth quarter of $25.6 million was about $10 million higher than our previous estimate. Major expenditures in the fourth quarter included an acceleration of our strategic gross spending including the relocation and expansion of our plant in Belarus and the expansion of our plants in Kunshan, China.", "In the fourth quarter, we also spent $2 million to begin construction of an office and development facility to consolidate our North American Snap-on business solutions operations. The economics to build this building are attractive, given a number of local tax incentives and consolidating these groups will lower future operating expenses.", "We expect this project will be completed in 2009. Our current plans call for 2009 capital spending to be in a range of $75 million to $80 million, but we are not financially committed at this level of expenditure. Should circumstances dictate, we will adjust our capital plans.", "This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Marty. Clearly, the economic challenges have increased. They appear to be spreading geographically and reaching more industries. I believe we said in the press release that as a result of the macroeconomic conditions and the financial headwinds of pensions and foreign exchange. We expect earnings to be down from last year in the first quarter, probably not a surprise. But we do enter 2009 in full throttle against those difficulties.", "Our RCI initiatives enabled us to offset rampant rises in commodity cost last year, and we see more opportunity for improvements in 2009. We are confident in the strength of those processes. We are confident that they can help us to limit the impact of the environment. So, we do see challenges going forward, but we also see opportunity, opportunity for strategic progress, just as we've made in recent quarters.", "So in 2009 we'll continue to maintain and strengthen our dealer network. And we believe gain share with technicians. We'll continue to role the Snap-on brand out of the garage, reaching more new customers and critical industries. We'll use our imaging technology and electronic parts catalogs and diagnostic products to gain share in automotive repair garages around the world.", "We'll become stronger in emerging market of the Asia Pacific and Eastern Europe. And I think most importantly, we're going to continue to build our innovation capabilities, because we've learned that that sells in any market. So going forward, we know we have challenges, but we also believe that our extraordinary business models, our brands and our capable processes will allow us to strike an effective balance. A balance between the long and short-term and allow us to emerge from these difficulties with an even stronger operation and stronger strategic positions than we enjoy today.", "Now I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from David Leiker. Please go ahead sir.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually Keith on the line for David. I just wanted to set off by diving into the CapEx number. If you do decide to eventually dial back on some of the things that you identified, I mean how much could that number fall versus the $75 million to $80 million guidance?", "Martin Ellen", "Keith, this number could fall in $20 million to $30 million range.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Right. But we're not considering dialing back at this point. I want to emphasize that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And can you just elaborate some more on some of the expenses in China and Eastern Europe that are driving the year-over-year increase?", "Martin Ellen", "Yes. Keith in, let's just start in the quarter, we spent about $25 million and if you look at our growth investments, as I said in Belarus and Kunshan, they alone were $6 million to $7 million of the $25 million and that was somewhat accelerated from our original plan. The balance we've got still manufacturing improvements and capacity expansions going on in other plan, both in Europe and the U.S and those were another $4 million to $5 million in the quarter and then of course, you've got a base level of normal maintenance CapEx.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. If we look at the SG&A or the operating expenses line, at a pretty sizeable year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the portion of that that's related to currencies and always going to be at the same magnitude and we are not going to get the contingency adjustment again. But is there any reason to believe that sort of base pace of decline can't continue or accelerate through 2009?", "Martin Ellen", "No, I mean, you said the word decline. We'll continue to remind you that, again our business model as we've sort of marched towards the mid single digit operating profitability target for the entire corporation, always included a structure that had us at mid 40s gross margin, about where we are and a lower 30s SG&A which is wherein recent periods, we've been making the improvements and we are going to continue to try to hold to that, even though the top line is going to be more challenged.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think what we've said is. This is Nick, Keith, this is Nick Pinchuk.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think, if you look at our results over the past several years, I don't think, I don't want to tie it to any percentage decrease, because that's associated with where the sales goes of course and that impacts somewhat. But we've been able to drive down our SG&A cost pretty effectively from quarter-to-quarter to quarter, because we believe strongly in the rapid continuous improvement process.", "And as I said on calls before, one of the great things about Snap-on is, it's a strong company. But everywhere Marty and I go, we see things that can be improved. Even today, after we've taken quite a few points out of SG&A. So, we see opportunity in the next quarter and for the foreseeable future in that line.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And if we look at just the year-over-year contribution margin across the businesses, and again we normalize for restructuring in the LIFO variances year-over-year. Was there anything in the quarter that was unusual or can you quantify the impacts on the manufacturing slowdowns?", "Martin Ellen", "Keith, our best estimate looks to be about $5 million of additional cost in the quarter due to production slowdowns.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Martin Ellen", "Obviously, you know our business, and as you think about modeling going forward, obviously the margin contribution, the variable contribution affects really depend on the business unit, because obviously they have different margins structures.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "You see a lot of different things occur. This is Nick again. You see a quite a few different things across the businesses. Big ticket items are down substantially, tool storage boxes are down almost 30%. However, I'd like to point out that just recently in the journal, they talked about, there was a article about sole revival, about the shoemakers having a boom. And at the same time the shoemakers in repairing shoes are having a boom, new shoe companies are lying off people.", "We're in automotive repair and our hand tools that are supporting that basic automotive repair are doing pretty well. They're pretty much flat year-over-year, even in the fourth quarter. It's the big ticket items that are hurting us. So when talk about production and absorption impacts, it's relatively complex question for us here.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then if we just look across each of the three business units, how are the things trended so far in January, versus sort of the reported numbers that we saw, organic growth numbers that we saw in the fourth quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, the January numbers are about consistent with December actually, in terms of sales on an overall basis. Now December was a little squeezed, compared to the overall fourth quarter, but we didn't see a dramatic drop-off in volume in January. However, I'll hasten to say that for Snap-on January is a very narrow month historically. So we never make judgments based on January, positive or negative.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "Martin Ellen", "Thanks Keith.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Seaver Wang with Utendahl Capital.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Hi, good morning.", "Martin Ellen", "Good morning.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Hi. You said on the call, I think Nick, that you got... you encouraged franchisees to lower inventory that was proved and prudent? So, is there... I guess what would be the catalyst for them to try to have their inventory back at regular levels, just to being more comfortable with the outlook of the environment or, I mean what would be that?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think so I said, I think that the situation here of course the U.S. sales are down 5%. We would like to see them, see a little more comfortable on that situation. I think they are sitting like any independent businessman and saying, we believe in our business model. They're feeling instinctively the same the Wall Street Journal is reporting with the shoemaker repair. That repair keeps going on. We are not in automotive manufacturing, we're in repair.", "But they get up every morning and eat bad news for breakfast when they see CNN and they start worrying about things. So they try to reduce, there not a little bit, because they worry that perhaps it could worse. And so, I think what we'll is when people believe, when generally, when I say people, I think the environment as the recession has bottomed out. We have measured the bottom and we now feel confident, we can start to build our inventories back up. I think that will be the signal point.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "And you can tell us, some of the magnitude was down maybe 10%, did you have a suggestion of 10% or 20% or and an idea of what they reduce their inventories by?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think, it's probably I'd say, you can say between somewhere approaching $10 million.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Okay. Alright and then just a quick question on acquisitions, your CapEx kind of keeping that mid $70 million to $80 million level and I guess if nothing changes, the acquisition strategy is still the same or do you think the activity will increase?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I think it's still the same. We remain alert for opportunities in critical areas where we think there might be acquisitions available that would further our strategic intent. In places like critical industries, in places like the automotive repair garage, in emerging markets things like that", "I think, I said it in my call. I actually, of course we're concerned and we are vigilant about the balance. But we see this situation as; in this situation we still see opportunities for share gain and perhaps the acquisition. I am not saying we're going to go on an acquisition binge, but we haven't changed our profile.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Martin Ellen", "Seaver, if it's more than this area (ph), CapEx as well because our guidance is $75 million to $80 million which is larger than we historically run at. Because we are building this facility in Ohio for business solution, that project get completes in '09, Had it not been for that project, our guidance probably would have be under $65 million, may be $70 million range. So, it's really a one-time expenditure and it completes in 2009.", "Seaver Wang - Utendahl Capital Partners, L.P.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Sarah Hunt with Alpine.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine", "Hi, good morning. Gentlemen.", "Martin Ellen", "Hey, Sarah.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine", "My question is more of a larger one. Instead of given what's going on in the macro world and the political world and how much outsourcing you as well as a lot of other folks have done. If we start to get some trade legislation that looks like, we've got U.S. content laws or something along those lines, what it that due to the basic philosophy of outsourcing in lower cost countries, is that something that you guys have been talking about yet or is that just something we're hoping doesn't happen?", "Martin Ellen", "Well, No. I think; look I think there aren't many companies. There aren't many manufacturing companies today in industries like ours that are sourcing as much in the United States. So I believe, if they pass legislation that requires U.S. sourcing, we'll be advantaged. Not disadvantaged. That doesn't mean we are not alert for... from a microeconomic sense, opportunities to outsource in Asia and so on. But Snap-on product, Snap-on brand is still by and large sourced in United States.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine", "Okay.", "Martin Ellen", "So I'd say we are among the most foremost in that situation. So bring it on.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine", "Okay. Thank you.", "Martin Ellen", "Sure.", "Operator", "And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Ellen for additional comments and closing remarks.", "Martin Ellen", "Thank you Ms. Dean and thank you everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us and have a wonderful day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Joining me today is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's President and CEO.  Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance.  I will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results afterwards we'll take your questions.  ", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion.  You can find a copy of the slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call.  These slides will be archived on our website, along with a transcript of today's call.  ", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state managements or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements.  Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.  ", "This call is copyrighted material by Snap-on Incorporated.  It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience; therefore, it cannot be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-on's expressed permission.  ", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick.  ", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, it appears we live in interesting times.  I'd say the difficulties of the period didn't really surprise us but no doubt that this was one of our more challenging quarters.  Sales were down 20% with currency contributing about seven points of that decline.  But as we left 2008, we said we believed that the recession was deepening, it was extending across more industries and geographies and that's pretty much what happened.  ", "But we also said that although we're certainly not immune to the downturn, Snap-on's business models are quite strong, and our rapid continuous improvement and other value creating processes, those strong processes will help us weather the storm.  They help us limit the damage of the downturn and they've done just that.  ", "So in terms of profitability in the first quarter, we were able to maintain or achieve about an 11% operating margin.  In other words, we're being impacted just like everybody else, but we were able to maintain a double-digit margin, even in the face of significant challenges.  We believe that's testimony to Snap-on's strengthening operating platform and to our robust improvement processes.  ", "Looking beyond the current difficulties, we remain confident.  We remain confident that our businesses have significant runway so we're continuing to invest.  We're working to strengthen those strategic areas that will make a significant difference as we emerge from the turbulence.  Of course, prominent among those strategic dimensions is our franchisee network.  We're working every day, training, launching new product, providing new systems, and building support mechanisms.  ", "We're determined to make that unique distribution asset even stronger and I have to say that that effort's been working.  We've maintained our van count and our franchisees are weathering the storm.  And as I said in the fourth quarter, we also aim to gain greater share in the auto repair garage segment, and we're going to do that by using our imaging technology and it appears as though that's continuing.  ", "We're also driving to extend the Snap-on brand in mission critical industries through our industrial division, and although the first quarter represented a step back from what had been consistently strong gains in that division, we're confident that our initiatives in that area will pay off as we move forward.  And I couldn't speak of strategic direction without mentioning emerging markets, so I'll just say that construction of our new plants in Eastern Europe and China are both progressing on schedule.  ", "Finally, we continue to invest in innovation.  It's still winning customers even in this environment.  A good example is our new MG325 power tool 3H in somatic impact power tool.  It's got a magnesium body, it's lightweight, it's got increased power and reduced size and it's breaking sales records, even in this market.  ", "So you see, we still believe in the forward opportunities, and because of that we've chosen not to close any large manufacturing facilities.  We believe that capacity will be needed as the market improves.  Now, there are costs in carrying those capabilities, but we're prepared to bear it and we haven't been inactive in cost reduction.  We've been aggressively applying our Snap-on value creation processes.  Processes like rapid continuous improvement or RCI as we call it.  We're applying those processes to continue to improve productivity and I think our numbers bear that out.  ", "And while our larger plants are still with us, two smaller facilities are in the process of closing as we speak, and there's been streamlining in a number of other areas.  In fact, generally across the corporation and we continue to plan in that regard.  We're planning continuing efficiencies as we move forward through the next quarter.  ", "So the first quarter, as expected, was a challenge but our strong business models, our extraordinary brand, our effective improvement processes, they limited the damage.  And at the same time they supported continuing investment in key strategic areas, areas that we believe will be strongly decisive for our future growth.  ", "Now, I'm going to landscape the individual operating groups.  Some of our biggest challenges today are in the commercial industrial group.  Similar to last quarter, it's just tough.  It's tough to sell big ticket items.  Capital goods like wheel service equipment, aligners, wheel balancers and tire changers.  Higher price products, they generally require reasonable customer confidence in the business outlook to justify a purchase.  Needless to say, that is abundant in this environment.  ", "Excluding currency, sales in our equipment division were down 22% reflecting just that.  Having said that though, we believe our investments in advanced technology like our imaging alignment actually improved our market position in the period in both the U.S. and Europe.  ", "We're also continuing to expand our equipment product line tailored specifically for Asia and assembled in our Kunshan factories.  In fact, we have a couple of existing introductions in our Asian lineups plan for later this year and those preparations are proceeding right on schedule.  ", "Turning to Europe, our Europe based tools business SNA Europe experienced a 23% sales decline before currency.  Now, there is some variance from country to country, for example, Spain the business's largest market was down 40%, while France, the second largest, was down just over 6%.", "It's clear now that the economy in Europe have slowed dramatically as the recession has deepened, and it's also clear that the credit crisis has imposed a tighter grip on our distributor's ability to purchase products.  And as a result, we saw further inventory de-stocking in that distributor channel.  ", "Regarding Europe, however, we did see a positive data point in March.  Average weekly sales were higher than the average was for the quarter and it improved from the quarter's low point.  Recent order activity has also risen, so I think it's too early to call this a trend, but it's something worth watching.  ", "Meanwhile, SNA Europe continues to work hard.  They're working hard at accelerating their own RCI activities continuing factory migration to lower cross countries and increasing the sourcing of finished goods from emerging markets.  All of that is consistent with driving stronger performance in good times or in bad.  ", "Our industrial business has faired relatively well in the quarter, although the global sales were down 6% before currency.  In the U.S. our businesses in several key segments, aerospace, natural resources and the government, did decline, but not surprisingly under the current conditions. Sales in our vocational training schools improved in the quarter.  ", "So despite the overall decrease in the industrial division, we continue to strengthen our position with customers across the critical segments served by that division because we're confident they offer extraordinary long-term growth potential.  As everyone knows, even Asia is slowing.  Notwithstanding that, we believe the regions still offer significant long-term potential, so our expansion plans there are continuing.  ", "I already mentioned the under-car equipment introduction scheduled for this year.  We also recently completed the migration of our bandsaw manufacturing into Kunshan and early in the third quarter we expect to complete our third Kunshan factory where we'll begin producing tool storage products in China for the first time.  That will give us a platform to penetrate local storage markets and provide a captive low cost source to support our mid-tier product strategy in developed countries out of Kunshan.  ", "We've chosen to continue the investments even in this environment because we believe strongly that they will pay off with significant growth.  In Snap-on tools the van segment, constant currency sales were down 11% globally and sales for the U.S. vans were down 18%, although sales off the U.S. vans decreased somewhat less about 11%.  As the difference is we continue to encourage franchisees de-stocking to improve their liquidity.", "In the U.S., the rate of sales decline did decelerate, however, toward the end of the quarter so we'll have to wait and see if the positive trend continues.  What we did see for sure in the quarter is that hand tool sales are holding about flat, but as in prior periods and as in the equipment business and a lot of places in our businesses, the big ticket product purchases, particularly tool storage boxes, have continued to be difficult.  We'll see how that plays out going forward.  ", "Van count in the U.S. was essentially flat, both for the year end and prior year levels.  With that said, the current environment is clearly challenging for our franchisees.  In that regard, we continue to support them.  We support them with a comprehensive set of programs, increased training, sales development, operating expense reduction opportunities, additional credit offering, and finally product promotional programs.  That's all aimed at aiding their profitability, helping their cash flow and strengthening stability of the network.  ", "And so far looking at the turnover data, which remains roughly flat, it appears to be working.  It's worth noting that auto repair spending in the U.S. continues to show growth.  That's logical as cars age in the face of significant reductions in new car sales repair will grow.  Our challenge is overcoming uncertainty.  Like most consumers, even technicians who generally have work are now cautious in their spending.  ", "For Snap-on that means they buy hand tools but they postpone the bigger ticket tool storage purchases, that's what we're seeing.  But this will change.  The auto repair industry is robust and its future is positive and pretty clear.  When the current uncertainty wears off, we're confident our franchise network will be healthy and in a strong position to take full advantage.  ", "The international van business for the most part continues to perform well.  Sales before currency were up 6%.  In the U.K. and Australia we grew vans by 25 about a mid single-digit percentage increase.  And we also had successful results with first quarter promotional programs in both of those countries.  ", "In the diagnostics and information group, sales were down about 14%, 10% without currency.  The toughest comparison was in our OEM facilitation business.  That was impacted by declines in spending on dealership equipment.  Now withstanding the D&I group sales decrease, however, profitability did improve.  Cost reductions, the benefits of RCI and sales of software updates more than offset the lower overall sales volume.  There's been considerable public discussion regarding the contraction in the American auto manufacturers and their dealer bases.  I believe most of you already know that Snap-on has little direct business with the OEMs themselves.  ", "And even our activities with dealerships and businesses like Snap-on Business Solutions and Equipment Solutions it's not tied to rooftops as much as it is tied to repair volume.  Now, turbulence in the dealership system can represent a near-term challenge, but overall this impacts a relatively narrow slice of our business.  With even that difficulty abating as the repair work redistributes throughout the national garage network.  ", "In the current environment, I don't believe it would be appropriate and I don't believe any discussion would be complete without touching on RCI.  It has been and it continues to be enabling for us.  It's shown the way to improving processes in both manufacturing and administration.  RCI is now simply a cornerstone of Snap-on's way of creating value.  It's helped us limit the damage of the downturn and we're confident it will be a big factor in our future.  ", "In that regard, we've been rigorous in managing down all areas of spending during the past quarters, and as indicated in this morning's press release, we do expect an increased level of restructuring in the second quarter that will further reduce our cost structure going forward.  Commodity costs are another important area of opportunity, and as expected we had some small increases in the first quarter.  The results of trailing price indices in items like steel.", "Nevertheless, we've been working strongly to take full advantage of the current environment and drive down those sourcing costs and we expect that effort to payoff as we proceed through the year.  So in the first quarter and probably for the next couple of quarters, the situation will be challenging.  But Snap-on has the processes to limit the damage.  We believe the last three months showed that.  ", "We also have a clear focus on the key strategic dimensions that will be decisive that will give us strength when the storm passes, and we'll continue to invest in those areas so that Snap-on will emerge from all the difficulties from all the downturns stronger than ever.  ", "Now, Marty will take you through the financial details.  ", "Martin M. Ellen", "I will begin my remarks with slide six.  As Nick mentioned, clearly the difficulties posed by the global economy increased considerably during the first quarter.  Recessionary headwinds challenged our top line sales performance in the quarter with sales declining [inaudible] before currency.  The affects of currency hit us fairly hard at two levels during the quarter as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  ", "First, [inaudible] U.S. dollar sales and profits were reduced because of translation, which on a year-over-year basis reduced sales by $54.5 million or 7.5%, and reduced operating income by $6.1 million.  Second, and as many of your know our Snap-on branded products sold by our international Snap-on tools franchisees are manufactured in the U.S., therefore, the stronger U.S. dollar cut into their gross margins by $5.3 million in the quarter.  ", "So in total currency reduced consolidated operating income in the quarter by $11 million.  If foreign currency rates stay at present levels through the second quarter of this year, year-over-year results for the second quarter will be similarly impacted, but this should begin to abate later in the second half.  ", "Our past and ongoing RCI initiatives have not only allowed us to improve quality, delivery, customer service and numerous other business processes, but through productivity improvements have allowed us to reduce cost.  The RCI related improvements and other cost reductions have enabled us to better offset the sales volume decline by providing $18 million of savings.  ", "In fact, if you remove the affects of currency, operating income on a comparable basis declined by $18.8 million on an organic sales decline of $95 million resulting a less negative operating leverage than might have otherwise occurred, so we're pleased with that outcome.  ", "Gross profit margin for the quarter was flat with last year at 45.2%.  Gross profit margin benefited in the first quarter from the rollover effect of certain pricing actions taken last year, and together with RCI improvements and other cost reductions, we were able to offset the negative affects on gross margin of currency and the cost to carry manufacturing capacity.  ", "Operating expenses declined by $41.1 million, but increased as a percentage of sales by 170 basis points.  This was primarily due to the negative leverage affect of lower sales on fixed operating expenses, not withstanding $11 million of RCI improvements and other cost reductions.  And as we had previously indicated, pension expense was up $3 million for the quarter year-over-year and we expect similar quarterly increases in pension expense throughout the remainder of 2009.  ", "Financial services contributed $10 million of operating income in the quarter, as compared with $12.8 million last year.  I'll cover financial services in a later slide.  As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $64.3 million for the quarter were down $28.9 million from last year.  As a percent of total revenues, operating earnings were 10.9% as compared to 12.5% a year ago.  ", "Interest expense in the quarter was down about $1 million from 2008 levels, primarily as a result of lower interest rates on our floating rate debt partially offset by higher interest expense from the first quarter issuance of $300 million of fixed rate five and ten year unsecured notes.  Diluted earnings per share of $0.60 in the quarter were down from the $0.97 earned last year.  ", "With that, I will now turn to our segment results.  Starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide seven, segment sales of $259.8 million declined 27.2%, but before currency sales declined 17.7%.  We continue to experience lower sales of professional tools in Europe and lower sales of equipment worldwide.  Sales in our worldwide industrial business were down 6%.  ", "Gross margin of 35.5% declined 180 basis points from last year as contributions from price increases taken in 2008 and $3.7 million of savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were more than offset by the lower organic sales volumes, including the cost to carry manufacturing capacity.  The increase of 200 basis points in the operating expense ratio was primarily caused by the effects of lower sales on fixed operating expenses partially offset with the benefits of RCI and other cost reduction initiatives of $2.9 million.  ", "The net result of these factors resulted in operating earnings of 6.9% compared to 10.7% a year ago.  Ignoring currency translation the drop through or negative leverage on operating earnings due to the sales decline in the segment was about 25%, which was somewhat limited by our RCI and other cost improvement actions. ", "Turning now to slide eight, on a worldwide basis, organic sales from the Snap-on tools group were down 10.7% reflecting the continued challenging sales environment, particularly for sales of larger priced products like tool storage units.  Sales declines in our North American franchise operations were partially offset by increased international sales, primarily in the U.K. and Australia.  ", "At quarter end, U.S. van count was essentially flat compared to both year end 2008 and prior year levels.  Sales in the U.S. were down 16.9%, but as Nick already mentioned, sales delivered off the vans were done only 11% on an average across the system.  Gross margin in the quarter was 42.4% as compared to 43.3% a year ago.  ", "Margin compression of $5.3 million occurred in the international businesses due to foreign exchange on U.S. sourced products.  Additional margin reduction resulted from the cost to carry manufacturing capacity in the face of reduced production levels.  Other cost improvements were achieved to partially offset these negative factors.  ", "Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $21.1 million in the quarter declined $13.3 million from prior year levels largely due to lower sales volumes, including the cost to carry manufacturing capacity and $7.7 million of unfavorable currency effects.  ", "Excluding currency impacts and on a comparable basis, the drop through effect of the sales decline was about 22% per Snap-on tools, much lower than the contribution margin structure of this business, as we were able to provide some offset with RCI and cost improvements of $6.5 million.  As a percentage of sales operating earnings in this segment were 8.7% as compared to 11.9% a year ago.  ", "Turning to the diagnostics and information group, which is shown on slide nine, first quarter sales of $132.5 million declined 10.2% before currency.  The sales decline is primarily due to lower essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships and lower sales of higher priced diagnostics products in North America.", "Sales of diagnostics products in Europe and sales of Mitchell 1 information products were both up slightly year-over-year.  As the OEM facilitation business is lower margin, the overall mix impact to the segment was favorable to margins.  Additionally, $5.1 million of RCI and other cost improvements along with $1.8 million of lower restructuring improved the segment's operating margins from 13.2% last year to 19.4% this year.", "Turning to slide ten, financial services operating income of $10 million was down $2.8 million from 2008.  Originations in the quarter were done 21% from last year, principally due to lower sales of big ticket items sold by our franchisees as these are the products which tend to get financed through Snap-on credit.  Lower discount rates on contracts sold partially offset the earnings impact of the lower originations.  ", "Many of you continue to ask about the credit quality of the portfolio of Snap-on credit loans to technicians.  Accounts 60 plus days delinquent at the end of March were about 2.2%, which is slightly better that the 2.3% that we reported to you as of the end of 2008.  To remind you, at the end of 2007 and 2006, they were about 2%.  ", "The high water mark was actually about 3% at the end of 2005 and was mostly due to the consolidation of Snap-on credit steel organization.  For years prior to 2005 and going back to 2001, the highest level experience was about 2.2%.  Both Snap-on credit and our franchisees have always worked diligently to control delinquencies and have heightened their efforts given the current environment.", "Now, let me turn to a brief discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet.  The cash flow statement issued with this morning's press release requires a little more analysis than usual.  Turning to slide 11, reported cash flow from operating activities in the quarter was $14.7 million compared to $74.4 million last year.  However, there were a number of items in both years not truly representative of the ongoing operating cash flows of our businesses.  ", "Slide 11 presents the operating cash flow section in a pro forma format in order to aid a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.  In the middle of the slide you will see adjusted operating cash flow.  We believe that the $32.5 million in adjusted operating cash flow this year compared to $51.2 million last year is a better representation of operating cash flow.", "We have separately listed the other items in order to reconcile to the amounts on the cash flow statement.  The $18.7 million decline in adjusted operating cash flow is principally caused by lower earnings and both a higher level of and certain variations in the timing of payments for a number of operating items.  Partially offsetting these outflows was a $35.8 million cash inflow improvement from working capital reductions.", "Now, below this level of adjusted operating cash flow there were certain other items included in the reported cash flow from operations.  Payments of $14.2 million were made under certain foreign currency hedge contracts, which you can see last year resulted in the receipt of cash of $2.6 million.  At current rates of foreign exchange we would not expect these payment outflows to continue.  ", "Also there were higher cash outflows related to restructuring payments this year compared to last year.  You will also note that last year's reported operating cash flow included certain cash receipts for the sale of a building and release of escrowed funds related to an acquisition.  Capital spending was $14 million in the first quarter of this year, which included planned growth spending for our plant in Belarus, and the further expansion of our plant in Kunshan, China.  ", "Last year first quarter capital spending was $15.4 million.  Our current plans call for 2009 capital spending to be in a range of $60 to $70 million, which is down from the previously communicated range of $75 to $80 million.  We will continue to mange the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities as warranted by the business environment, and we will adjust our capital plans accordingly.  ", "As seen on slide twelve, accounts receivable decreased $43.8 million from year end levels, primarily due to the lower sales and continued strong collections.  Currency translation accounted for $12.6 million of the decrease.  Day's sale outstanding improved to 62 days at quarter end compared to 64 days at year end.  All of our businesses are being extra vigilant in managing and monitoring customer accounts and credit risks in this environment.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were done $18.5 million reflecting $11.1 million of currency translation and $7.4 million of lower net inventories.  Due to the slow sales environment, inventory turns declined from 4.6 times at year end 2008 to 4.3 times currently.  Where our manufacturing production schedules in response to the continued volume declines and expect further reductions in inventories.  ", "Net debt at the end of the quarter of $416.3 million was up $16.7 million from year end 2008.  Our net debt to capital ratio of 26.5% increased slightly from 25.2% at year end.  Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.  Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $400.7 million.  ", "We issued $300 million principal amount of long-term unsecured notes on February 24 to take advantage of what we believed were favorable market conditions in what continues to be an uncertain and unpredictable credit environment.  ", "We issued $100 million of notes due in 2014 at an all in effective rate of 6% including discount fees and expenses, and $200 million of notes due in 2019 at an all in effective rate of 6.8%.  We anticipate using the net proceeds of $298 million from the debt issuances for general corporate purposes, including the payment of $150 million of upcoming debt maturities in January 2010. ", "In addition to the $400 million of available cash on hand and our cash flows from operations, we currently maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility provided by a strong diversified group of international banks, which does not expire until August 2012.  We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines.  ", "At quarter end, the entire $520 million of borrowing capacity was available.  In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we chose to do so.  We presently have no commercial paper outstanding.", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance.  Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts.", "", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Well, as expected, we found the first quarter to be challenging.  The recession spread and it impacted more of our operations.  But as we said before, and as we said before, Snap-on is not immune to the difficulties.  But our business models, our brand and the robust processes that make up Snap-on value creation they combine to limit the damage.", "We believe this business has strong runway so we've continued to invest.  Invest in the health of our franchisees, in the penetration of critical industries, in the driving of our technology advantage and repair garages, and in building our emerging market position.  And we're making headway in each of those areas and we believe it will serve us well as we go forward.  ", "One other closing thought.  Snap-on has made significant progress over recent quarters, lowering breakeven and becoming generally a stronger enterprise.  Just consider this, the last time our sales were this low was in the first quarter of 2006 they were about $585 million.  That's not too long ago, first quarter of 2006.  OI margin in that period was 6.5%.  That means that OI margins in the first quarter of 2009 at roughly the same volume were about 400 basis points better.", "Now, we'll be the first to say that we're far from satisfied by the past quarter's results.  There is, believe me, abundant room for improvement.  However, I can't let this call end without recognizing the extraordinary contributions of our associates and franchisees that have brought us so much.  The people that have authored the 400 basis points of improvement over just that short time, my thanks to each and every one of you.", "Now, we'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from David Leiker - Robert W. Baird.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "A couple of things, the one big item that jumps out is the SG&A line.  Can you give us some perspective of how much of that performance there is a function of you taking costs out of the business on a permanent basis as opposed to the numbers flexing with where the revenue line is so we have some sense going forward how sustainable this level of SG&A spending is?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, generally the way we view it, David, is like this, it's an imprecise science, of course, but we figure about 5% comes out, about $5 million, you got $100 million worth of movement, which we had in the quarter in sans currency. You get about $5 million out for direct variable costs associated with the selling operation.  And then you got between $7 and $10 associated with I'll say temporary cost reductions associated with the volume of activity, and then the rest I think are pretty good permanent type cost reductions.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "If you look back at the beginning of the quarter, where are the things that are most different than what you were expecting them to be?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think a few things.  I think first of all we didn't expect as much de-stocking of the European distributor businesses.  That was a little stronger than we thought.  So we saw de-stocking there through January into February.  That lasted longer than we thought it was going to be.  As I said, it seems to be abating a little bit.  Big ticket items drove deeper than we thought.  Those are the two, and then I think we saw industrial, the mission critical businesses soften somewhat more than we had expected.", "I would have said, David, that directionally we expected de-stocking both in our franchisees and in the distributors, so we're not talking directionally we're talking about how much.  And we expected big ticket items, we've been talking big ticket items for a long time and certainly that's an issue.  I think we didn't know where industrial was going to come out.  ", "We knew we'd be impacted eventually by the uncertainty and so on, so we didn't know where that was going to happen and it came out maybe a little lower than we thought.  I'm not sure how that's going to play out going forward because we  had some good news and some bad news in that area, as I elaborated on in the call.  Schools were up and some of our other businesses were down.  So that's really where we were, we are.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "But it sounds like as you ended the quarter, early signs that things are at least stabilized if not getting a little bit better?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes.  I don't want to get, I think being in the prediction business in this environment is a dangerous profession.  But I will say logically this, is that there has to be an end to destocking and so we would expect that to end at some time going forward.  And I think maybe we're seeing some of that play out both in the franchisee business and in the European business.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And just one last item and that's if you can touch on your franchisees here in the U.S. and just their financial health and how they're weathering the downturn and if there's anything you're doing extraordinarily to help them out, and just kind of talk about the state of the franchise business for us.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Okay, sure.  I think the top line is the franchisees are managing the downturn with reasonable capability with our aid.  Terminations and on-hold franchisees, which are sort of our measures of problems in the system, are flat.  So we haven't seen significant changes in those leading indicators or indicators of franchisee health.  That's one good thing.  I think we feel good about that.  ", "There was a dip say through February in what I would call delivered sales for the franchisees and that's come back in March, so we're seeing a little bit of positives in that regard.  On an anecdotal basis, I was just with about 400 franchisees in a colloquium and they were all reasonably positive.  Now, I suppose I could have selected a different set of 400 franchisees and gotten a little bit more pessimistic view of the world.  But I think in general we would say that our franchisee system is maintaining itself reasonably well. ", "We have what we call a Snap-on stimulus package, so we're out trying to help them every day.  We're working overtime trying to train them how to identify business opportunities in terms of reducing their own SG&A, just things we've been talking about in terms of making sense, don't idle the truck as much and you save fuel that kind of thing, using different ways to purchase various commodities.  We also are providing them a little more support from time to time.  ", "For example, selective places where we're providing extensions on some of the leases for their vans, we've implemented a new program called a small balance extended credit, which takes our traditional credit activity and moves it down in sticker price to allow it to be more effective for the franchisees and maybe they don't need quite so much cash to manage their, what we would call their usual day-to-day business.  ", "And we've been installing some new systems, which allow them to be more productive in getting to more customers.  And I would just leave it at, we get up every day I think I tell them this, and it's really true thinking about how to improve their health so we keep coming up with ideas and put it as part of their, as part of the stimulus package.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott.", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "First question on the CapEx, while the adjustment is not big in terms of material dollars just wanted to delve a little deeper just from a thought process.  Were there any particular project, one project that was cancelled or is this just reviewing your plans going into the year and tightening the budget?", "Martin M. Ellen", "", "Jim, it's Marty, good morning.  It's really the latter, and as we said in our prepared remarks, the important focus investment, the very important strategic investments continue.  But as you can imagine in this environment, for example, project that target productivity improvement for example at the margin in factories that already have excess capacity, those could be postponed in this environment.  So we continue to look at it diligently, and the small reduction of $10 million or so we guided this morning was a result of that review.", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Two housekeeping questions, the flat van count, what is the actual number?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Jim, in the U.S. we're roughly at 34, 45.", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Okay and R&D in the quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Give me your next question.", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And then switching gears, you know, Nick, you alluded to a couple of, for lack of a better term, early indications that there may be some signs out there that things are at least not getting worse.  Europe you talked about the de-stocking at the distributor level.  When you're looking at going forward of where demand versus inventory levels are in the distribution channel, how much of a disconnect do you see out there in Europe right now?", "Nicolas T. Pinchuk", "", "Well, I think, we were down 23% versus last year in terms of our absolute numbers and I think you could say that the disconnect is between five and ten points.  It's the same kind of thing we're seeing in the United States.  ", "The United States is somewhat less, but we see that kind of thing we laid out that out for you that the off the van sales is down 11%, but the absolute number was 18%, a little bit longer and that range is the same kind of thing we're seeing in Europe.", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "And with regards to the emerging market strategy, in the prepared remarks you talked about some of the manufacturing moves that are taking place.  With regards to some of the sales initiatives, you've talked a lot in terms of opportunities in China with the [Bako] brand in particular, looking into Eastern Europe as well as some non-automotive markets.  What is the early read through with some of those investments you made on the sales side?", "Nicolas Pinchuk", "", "Well, we're doing our position in equipment, if you want to go product by product, is fairly strong.  Our equipment product line is certainly, if not the leader, one of the leaders, certainly the leader in the premium equipment business in many of the markets in Asia.  So we're very positive about that.  We see that as helping us penetrate the garage in a big way and get us in there, an opportunity to demonstrate Snap-on technology.  ", "We have a sort of Asianized version of our imaging alignment in there now.  And we're launching a new product I guess it will be the third or fourth quarter this year in Asia that will allow us to penetrate automotive garages and I'm pretty sanguine about that.  Our [Bako] businesses, our hacksaw business in Asia when we transferred our hacksaws to Asia, that worked fairly well for us and we continue having nonpareil brand in the cutting tools of Asia.  ", "There are places, I think we've had this discussion before where the [Bako] branded cutting tools are premium line in several of the hardware distribution outlets in Asia.  So we feel pretty good about that.  The Wand activity we're still early days in developing our hand tool line for Asia.  So I suppose you could say the jury is still out on that, but we remain confident in the ability to do that.  Does that give you some color?", "James Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "That's very helpful.  Final question, I'm not sure if this is directed to you or Marty, kind of somewhat interrelated that the balance sheet taking advantage of recent markets locking into some good rates.  You've got very healthy balance sheet, you alluded to the liquidity you have on there.  So just any updates on the capital allocation and then secondly, with regards to the Snap-on credit joint venture, any updates there as well?", "Nicola T. Pinchuk", "", "Well, I'll deal with the capital allocation, I think we've said it, we took advantage of the credit markets because we thought the numbers were favorable, the rates were favorable.  We have a tranche of debt that comes due I think next January.  We wanted to be in position to manage that capably.  That will still give us some substantial amount of cash and how we use that going forward will be determined as events evolve.  ", "We are not without the idea that we could have acquisition opportunities, but I'm not signaling the idea we'd talk about acquisitions.  And there is, of course, the credit company discussions that are ongoing, and I'll let Marty talk about the credit company.", "", "Martin M. Ellen", "", "Yes, Jim, as you know and as many of you know on the call, our U.S. joint venture Snap-on Credit with CIT essentially expires in January 2010, unless both parties choose to renew.  That's a decision that needs to be made by June 30 of this year.  I'll provide you with some color in terms of CIT and I'll preface my remarks by saying that none of my information comes from the inside at all, it's public domain information.  ", "I will say that we believe CIT wants to renew the joint venture.  We believe that CIT's condition and status has improved dramatically over the last year, which is a good sign as many of you know they ran into the same difficulties that many financial services firms ran into.  And over the last year have, in fact, become a bank holding company, have received government funds and have a number of the government, what I call, subsidy programs available to them.  Their capital ratios have improved.  ", "So those are all very good signs in terms of their health.  And given the improvement in their health and their desire to want to continue, we are proceeding with them on that basis through negotiations and discussions and will have to have a final decision before the end of the second quarter.", "Nicolas T. Pinchuk", "", "I wanted to circle back, excuse me, your R&D question not to avoid it.  We spent about $10 million and you'll see in the detailed P&L in the Q, about $10 million in R&D and SG&A.  However, I should point out our software development costs, much of our software development costs, which were actually $2 million higher this year than year, do get reported in cost of goods sold.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Tony Cristello \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets.", "Anthony Cristello \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "", "One of the questions I had when you look at sort of some of the trends in the industry and as it pertains to your business, particularly with the dealerships shift and some of the forecasts for the number of dealerships that may be closing, how do you look at your business in the evolution of your business should the aftermarket one, start to see more business sent their way as a result of declining either new car volumes or bay closings?", "And two, would the probably influx of more qualified or at least more late model qualified technicians into the aftermarket into an industry that has been at a disadvantage or at least a shortage from a labor standpoint, how does this I would imagine help your business?", "Nicolas T. Pinchuk", "", "It helps it a lot.  First of all, we love it when the aftermarket gets more business because in effect independent garages engage a wider range of vehicles makes sense, right.  Chevy dealership primarily works on Chevy's so, therefore, its need for a broad range of tools, whether diagnostics or hand tools or power tools, to deal with that particular model, those particular geometries, those particular computer systems, are much narrower.  ", "So the aftermarket to the extent that there's more repair hours to the aftermarket, each technician must be prepared to deal with a wider range of products, he buys more tools.  We document this all the time.  And one of the great things about it is our diagnostics businesses, for lack of a better word, laptop for cars.  ", "We have, of course, some pretty strong ergonomic laptops that plug into cars or deal with them on a wireless basis.  But we also have probably the best database of a wide range of models over a wide number of years, and that gives us a great competitive advantage in the aftermarket.  So we like it when the aftermarket gets more.", "Anthony Cristello \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "It would seem with projected SAAR and projected dealership closings that you might be positioning or have some of the best tailwinds you might have seen in your business in some time.  And I'm just wondering at what point do you start to see that inflection where, let me step back.  When you look at your customer, is a dealer technician or is an aftermarket installer, does one differ more than the other in terms of the purchasing power or the amount of generation or revenue capture you can get from one customer versus the next.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Yes, there are.  The independent technician, the aftermarket guy purchases more tools.  That's for sure.  He'll purchase more hand tools.  He'll purchase more diagnostics.  So to the extent he has more business, we have more business.  So we love the trend.  Now when does this happen?  I'm not so sure.  In the last let's say year, the OEM dealerships and primarily you're talking about the Americans now because they're the one who have stated their closing dealerships, they had a base of about 14,000 dealerships.  They closed 800 or 900 or so.  They're talking about closing another 3600.  ", "It's an imprecise science, Tony, because you're talking closing rooftops as opposed to where the repair's going to go.  But some of that business is going to migrate to other dealerships, some of it's going to migrate to independents and to the extent it migrates to the independents, we'll see an uptick.  But I can't tell you where the inflection point will be.  I can tell you if for example GM, Ford and Chrysler decided to close down their aftermarket, we would benefit.", "Anthony Cristello \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "", "That's helpful because it definitely seems like you're business is very well positioned both diagnostically and from a tool standpoint from the aftermarket, and it seems like trends definitely are headed that way.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Before you go I want to point out, though, we have a good penetration of the OEM dealerships, too.  We're in those businesses as well so we like those businesses.  It's just the nature of the industry the way it's structured is that the independents use more of our products.", "Anthony Cristello \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "", "Well, and I would imagine if you've got a dealer, an OE dealer technician who maybe their facility closes their base closed and he lands in the aftermarket, what's the likelihood that he brings that brand recognition with him and thus may get a lift for existing customers as well.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "It might be.  It might be.  Certainly, the technicians are not going to go away they're going to go to, if a Ford dealership closes on one corner and there's no other Ford dealerships in town or dealerships in town, those guys are going to be employed in the independents.  They'll bring their tools and they'll bring their customers, but they'll need more tools to work as an independent.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sarah Hunt \u2013 Alpine Fund.  ", "Sarah Hunt \u2013 Alpine Fund", "", "To sort of follow up on that on a different way, if we get a junker clunker law, or something along those lines that has an incentive to put people in new cars, how do you guys feel about that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, obviously that would change the aging of the cars, but the other factor about that is when new cars come out, they have new facilities or new geometries.  One, they tend to have more computers.  They tend to have different geometries and a lot of our new product innovation has to do with the new cars coming out.  So I'm no sure how that would affect us.", "Sarah Hunt \u2013 Alpine Fund", "Okay, so you don't look at that and say, sort of it could be, it could go either way.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Right, I'd have to figure that out.  We'd have to look at it carefully.  But for example, if the world changed to hybrids tomorrow, we'd still be in business, believe me.  In fact, it might help us.  In our business any kind of change probably helps.  Moving into independents is a positive to us.  Moving to new cars can be a positive when those new cars come in.  Aging of cars helps us at some point, too.  ", "Sarah Hunt \u2013 Alpine Fund", "Okay, I was just curious as to what you guys thought about it.  ", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Right, I don't know.  We monitor that, I'm not sure there is going to be a junker law but it'll be interesting to see what happens.", "Sarah Hunt \u2013 Alpine Fund", "", "Well, it seems to be all over the place and then they yes for foreign, no for foreign, so I'm not sure they're actually going to get anything done.  But certainly Germany, from a new car sales perspective, it definitely listed sales.  So I'm just curious as to whether or not that was something that you felt positively or negatively about.  But it's an interesting thought because change is good for you, so it may not be a clear cut negative.", "Operator", "", "And as it appears there are no further questions at this time, Mr. Ellen, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Martin M.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Marty Ellen, Chief Financial Officer. ", "Marty Ellen ", "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s second quarter 2009 results. By now you should have seen our press release issued this morning. Joining me today is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's CEO. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. I will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results, afterwards we'll take your questions. ", "Consistent with past practice, we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website, along with a transcript of today's call. ", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state managements or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. ", "Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. ", "This call is copyrighted material by Snap-on Incorporated. It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience, therefore, it cannot be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-on's expressed permission. ", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick. ", "Nick Pinchuk ", "Thanks Marty, good morning everyone, well, the challenges continue. But at the same time the evidence of further improvement of how far we\u2019ve progressed also continued to be evident. Sales were down 23%, 16% if you exclude the impact the currency. And I think its fair to say that the global economy is creating some strong headwinds. ", "Having said that we\u2019re encouraged by our overall results in the face of difficulty. In a period where volumes were quite weak we managed to reach an operating margin before restructuring of 12.8%, double-digit margins in a difficult environment and profit improvement of 160 basis points from the first quarter on essentially flat sales. ", "Solid testimony that our operations are continuing their trend of improvement, that our business models are strong and that RCI and our other value creating processes are in deed working. As part of that progress our emphasis on managing working capital especially inventory levels, resulted in strong operating cash flow. ", "Cash flow for the quarter exceeded $155 million, there are of course some very real costs, unrealized manufacturing capacity, they resulted from reducing inventory levels and creating that cash but we\u2019re showing the discipline to bear those near-term costs in exchange for the long-term benefits of inventory reduction. ", "While we don\u2019t have perfect insight to the future, we do remain confident, confident that the going forward prospects for our businesses remain strong. We see considerable runway in a number of directions and as we said before we are acting aggressively to limit the damage associated with the downturn, rapid continuous improvement, restructuring, focus on sourcing costs, are all being engaged and the benefits I think are evident in the results. ", "But at the same time we continue to invest in those areas we believe will be decisive going forward creating advantages that position Snap-on to emerge from the current difficulties with an even stronger competitive position. ", "In that regard, in that area we\u2019ve identified four key areas of focus; maintaining the health of our franchisee network, expanding our reach through the garage, rolling the powerful Snap-on brand out of the garage into other mission critical arenas, and capitalizing on the opportunities that are in emerging markets.", "And along those lines we clearly are attending to the welfare of our franchisees. There\u2019s a special franchise stimulus package, promotions and advertising to help them better reach their technician customers. There are van expense reduction programs in areas like, such as communication, sell communications, shipping, tires, and office supplies. ", "Those little improvements add up to substantial savings for our van drivers and we\u2019ve been raising the profile of our event marketing helping our franchisees tie their selling efforts to special programs. A good example of that is the Snap-on No Compromise Tour. It\u2019s a moving product display including some specialty items like our Glo-mad 57 Chevy. ", "Its now played to enthusiastic receptions around the country in 80 different locations, been visited by 200,000 customers and has created a nice sales boost for our franchisees. We spent quite some energy on these areas, all supporting the network. And its paid off. Franchisee sales and franchisee equity both have risen in recent months and that\u2019s a trend we\u2019re working hard to continue.", "The auto repair garage itself is another area of strategic importance for us. And in the quarter we made progress with some big wins for our VERUS handheld diagnostic system. VERUS is the most powerful diagnostic tool on the market today and its penetration expanded throughout the second quarter. ", "We\u2019ve also spoken often about rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage and into some of the world\u2019s mission critical industries like aviation and aerospace and power generation. That effort continued at the June Paris Air Show where we previewed what we think is a ground breaking unit, our Level 5 automated tool control system. ", "That unit offers unparalleled features and benefits and we expect that will advance the Snap-on penetration of several mission critical industries. Finally as we\u2019ve spoken often on these calls we\u2019re also continuing to invest in our emerging markets. The construction of our new plant in Belarus in China are both progressing on time. ", "And we\u2019re adding more products to those regions, a great example is our just introduced CT 561 pocket impact wrench, Snap-on brand designed in the US, manufactured in Kunsan, great power to weight ratio. We\u2019re confident its going to gain share on multiple continents. ", "During the quarter we did spent $8 million on restructuring. As part of that we acted on the consolidation of mid sized operations in both Europe and North America and executed a number of targeted down sizing actions across the corporation. ", "Those restructuring actions have resulted in consolidation but without loss of manufacturing capability. Now consistent with the conviction that our markets will recover and our competitive position to take advantage of that comeback is strengthening we have chosen not to reduce long-term capacity. ", "Of course there\u2019s some capacity carrying penalty associated with that strategic choice. We did however bear that weight in the second quarter and still achieved sequential improvement. Now I\u2019ll landscape the performance at our individual operating groups. ", "The cost of maintaining capacity and managing inventory levels are clearly evident in the results of the commercial industrial segment. Actually the challenges to those operations that we faced three months ago, they intensified. The broad based recession deepened particularly in Europe and I think we should remember that the businesses included in C&I operate in the markets that are being exceptionally hard hit by the recession. ", "Big ticket items like garage equipment, the industrial sector which had held up for us fairly well and then declined in the second quarter and Europe where the GDPs are down and the distributors are destocking. ", "Overall the segment saw sales and profit declines compared with both 2008 and with the first quarter of the year. Our European based tools business SNA Europe accounted for much of that decline. While the sales for that business decreased almost 25% from the last year excluding currency, the earnings of the business were uniquely hit on a number of fronts. ", "First over $4 million of our restructuring was incurred at SNA Europe. I believe that was probably appropriate for a business so challenged. Second, SNA Europe sells primarily through distributors and we continued to see those channel partners destock. On the last call we said that logically destocking had to end at some time. ", "Well we haven\u2019t seen it yet abate. And that phenomenon accounts for about half of SNA Europe\u2019s sales decline. Also in the face of declining sales and in the interest of inventory control and cash management production in SNA Europe was scaled back even more than the decrease in customer demand.", "In fact our analysis of cash flows for the quarter shows that the company generated cash of over $55 million as a result of inventory reductions, a majority of that was in the C&I segment and SNA Europe was a significant contributor. ", "Therefore I think you can say substantial costs of inventory reduction and maintaining capacity were borne by our operation SNA Europe and that burden reflected not only the markets they serve but also the decision to reduce production levels even further than the decline in demand. ", "As befits the environment there actions are being taken to lower break-even and limit the damage in Europe. A significant portion of the second quarter restructuring was aimed at SNA Europe and a major share of our second half restructuring will be focused on that business as well. ", "We\u2019re confident we\u2019re taking the right actions to recover. We are however moving into the third quarter where European business is slowed by vacation so the recovery at SNA Europe will not be immediate. ", "Speaking of the other C&I operations, sales in our equipment division were down 20% excluding currency. And while its still a very tough market we were encouraged that the year over year declines in North America were less than we saw in the first quarter. Some improvement. ", "Consistent with Europe in general however we did not see the same improving trend in Europe although things seemed to have stabilized for equipment in that arena. During the quarter at the Auto Promote Tech Show in Bologna we did strengthen our position in the strategically important vehicle repair shop segment with the launch of the world\u2019s most advanced tire changer, the Quadriga. ", "It incorporates advanced sensors, motion control elements that ensure that the changer will do no harm to the more sophisticated and expensive tires and rims. So even in this market we continue to launch new and innovative products utilizing advance technology and we believe based on innovation like the Quadriga, Snap-on is capturing share as a result. ", "As I said earlier the industrial business also felt the impact of the economic environment in the second quarter. Year over year sales declined 30%. Now some of that was due simply to delivery timing but we did see a general softening. We do believe however that Snap-on has a unique opportunity to gain share during the downturn. ", "For example in this era of cost control mission critical industries like aerospace and power are focusing heavily on improving their operational efficiencies. And with our strength in providing productivity enhancing solutions, we\u2019re in a good position to gain as the customers explore new products, processes and embrace innovation. ", "As part of the drive to new industries, we\u2019ve recently launched a new torque certification program designed specifically for the growing global wind industry. Programs like that and other certification programs and partnerships with technical and vocation schools are creating effective runway for Snap-on. ", "They\u2019re gaining a foothold with mission critical users as they learn their trade and we\u2019re confident that the certification effort will translate into even more share gain as the student techs enter the work force. ", "Moving on to Snap-on tools we saw some positive trends in the van segment. Constant currency sales were down 7.5% from last year but up over 4% from the first quarter. Sales in the US were down 8.5% from last year. We did see an encouraging sign with big ticket diagnostics and tool storage being a bit stronger. ", "I\u2019d say though that it remains to be seen if the good news will hold but its encouraging to see the positive trend even if its only for a quarter. Now the US van count remained essentially flat from last quarter but we continue to work hard against the challenges of this uncertain economic environment to move that van count forward. ", "Speaking for a moment about macroeconomics its worth noting that auto repair spending in the US continued to show strength as cars age in the face of significant reductions in new car sales. What that says is that the auto repair industry is robust and its future is positive and when the current uncertainty wears off we\u2019re quite confident that our franchisee network with be healthy and in a strong position to take full advantage. ", "Finally for the tools group I had the opportunity to spend last weekend with more than 2,000 of our franchisees at their annual conference. They were enthusiastically taking advantage of the training and the support initiatives. We make them available at the meeting to help them run their business. ", "I have to say they were almost unanimously positive about the business outlook. It was a counterpoint to the every day bad news that seems to surround us constantly. And there was tangible testimony to the positive attitude. This is not just a training event, its also a tool show where franchisees made some fairly significant purchases and this year, orders set a record beating the old mark by a significant margin. ", "Of course one show won\u2019t deliver us from difficulty but it is some cause for encouragement. In the diagnostics and information group sales were down 12.5% from last year on a constant currency basis. Our OEM facilitation business continues to be impacted by the reluctance of OEM dealerships to make large investments in big ticket items. ", "Sales for the segment however were up about 2% from last quarter. D&I was helped by the UK launch of the VERUS. As I said before that product is loaded with features including over one million troubleshooter time saving tips and the ability to access the web. ", "The VERUS has proven to us again that innovation and productivity enhancing products sell even in these poor economic times. As I mentioned last quarter Snap-on has limited direct business with automotive OEMs. Overall our business is generally tied more to industry repair volume and the fundamentals in that section remain strong. ", "Having said that selected franchisees may see some difficulty until route adjustments can be made to accommodate dealership closures. In aggregate though we expect the repair hours from terminated dealerships to move either to another dealership or to an independent garage.", "To the extent it moves to independents, it favors Snap-on. Independent mechanics buy more tools and equipment per capita then those in dealerships. So if independents share of repair keeps growing as it has recently it\u2019s a positive for Snap-on. ", "The current turmoil in the automotive business does create challenges for us specifically in our Snap-on business solutions and equipment solutions areas. These are the businesses that engage directly with the OEMs and the dealerships. Each of those divisions however is actively engaged in mining and capturing opportunities in international markets and adjacent industries like heavy trucks. ", "Those opportunities are providing and will provide some offset to potential disruption associated with that dealer consolidation in the United States. Now in a moment Marty will speak about the financials and other details related to the recent events surrounding our termination of the financing joint venture with CIT. ", "What I\u2019ll do is just remind you that CIT\u2019s role in the venture was primarily as a bank to fund the operations. We believe we have adequate liquidity and availability of funds to fill that void. Most importantly we\u2019re confident that the transition will be seamless to our franchisees and to our other customers.", "We expect there\u2019ll be no negative effects on sales within the van channel, or anywhere else. Finally no Snap-on discussion would be complete without touching on Snap-on value creation. The suite of processes that drive our success focused on safety, quality, customer connection, RCI and innovation. The value of our RCI I think is written across Snap-on\u2019s results in the second quarter and for many previous quarters. ", "I\u2019ll only say that our energy dedicated to that process remains substantial and the apparent opportunities for gain continue to be abundant. Regarding innovation you\u2019ve heard about our effort in formalizing our product development processes and our actions to enable those processes with a significant new facility innovation works in Kenosha. ", "Just in this quarter we have evidence that its working in products like the Quadriga, the world\u2019s most advance tire changer, the CT 561 our unique pocket impact wrench, and the level 5 automated tool control system. But also I spoke of the enthusiasm at our franchisee conference. ", "One of the primary reasons for that excitement was that Snap-on introduced over 60 new products at that event, more than ever before. We\u2019re going to keep investing in innovation. We\u2019re confident it will sell even today and will position us for leadership as the economies clear. ", "So that\u2019s our second quarter, continuing headwinds, encouraging profitability, sequential improvement, actions to offset the challenges, runway for the future and continued investment in the four strategic dimensions which will give us the advantage going forward. ", "Now Marty will take you through the financial details. ", "Marty Ellen ", "Thanks Nick, I will begin on slide six, reported sales in the second quarter of $590 million were down 23% from last year. Absent the effects of foreign currency this reduction was 16.4%. as expected the effects of currency continued to hit us hard on two fronts given the strengthening of the US dollar from prior year levels.", "First currency translation reduced reported US dollar sales by $50.2 million contributing a $7.1 million decline in operating income. We also have currency exposure to cross border product flows. The most significant related to our Snap-on branded products, manufactured in the US and sold by our international franchisees. ", "The net global effect was a reduction in gross margin of $3.2 million. So in total currency reduced consolidated operating income in the quarter by $10.3 million. Year to date currency has reduced 2009 operating income by $21.3 million. ", "Assuming current exchange rates hold we expect to see a somewhat lessened currency impact on our third quarter year over year comparisons. We recorded $8.6 million of restructuring costs in the quarter which is a fairly substantial increase over the $2 million recorded both last year and last quarter. ", "We communicated to you last quarter to expect this higher level of restructuring spending in response to the economic climate. Of the $8.6 million, $6.7 million relates to the commercial and industrial segment. Year to date restructuring expenses are $10.6 million, with $8 million related to the C&I segment. ", "We intend to spend about another $12 million over the balance of 2009 with most of this related to the C&I segment. Our full year expected restructuring spending is estimated to result in about $34 million in annualized cost savings. ", "At the end of June our worldwide staffing levels have declined by almost 9% since the beginning of this year. Cost savings of $30 million in the quarter include $13 million of RCI related productivity improvements, $10 million of general cost containment actions, and material cost reductions of $7 million. ", "These savings are clearly enabling us to maintain reasonable operating margins through this global recession. Before restructuring costs the second quarter operating margin this year was 12.8%. Our consolidated gross profit margin was 43.1%, down 210 basis points from last year. ", "Before the effects of restructuring the gross margin was 44%, down 120 basis points. A major factor this quarter was the effect of lower production volumes on the performance of our factories as a result of both lower customer demand and our desire to further reduce inventories. ", "This caused about a 310 basis point decline in our consolidated gross profit margin with a significant portion of this due to our SNA Europe business. And as I said earlier the net effect of currency on our cross border product flows also reduced gross margin by about 50 basis points. ", "We were able to partially offset these declines with improved pricing across some [businesses], better mix, [inaudible] cost savings and other cost reductions. Consolidated operating expenses declined by $45.3 million. The reduction in year over year operating expenses is principally due to lower selling expenses, $17.2 million of savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives, a $13.5 million reduction caused by currency translation, and lower incentive compensation expense.", "Pension expense increased by $3 million as a result of last year\u2019s decline in pension asset values. As discussed in previous quarters we expect similar quarterly increases in pension expense throughout the remainder of 2009. ", "This year\u2019s operating expenses include $3.1 million of restructuring costs compared to $2.1 million last year. As a percentage of sales operating expenses were 33.9% compared to 32.1% last year. Financial services contributed $16.6 million of operating income in the quarter as compared with $10.8 million last year. ", "The termination of the joint venture agreement with CIT which occurred on July 16 did not have any impact on our second quarter results. I\u2019ll cover financial services in more detail in a later slide. Our operating margin 12.8% before restructuring improved sequentially by 160 basis points. ", "We believe this results from our balancing of RCI and cost reductions, while continuing to spend on key initiatives such as innovation and targeted growth opportunities. Interest expense in the quarter increased $2.8 million as a result of the first quarter issuance of $300 million of fixed rate five and 10 year unsecured notes. ", "The higher interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates on our existing floating rate debt. Our second quarter effective income tax rate was 31.9% as compared to 34.3% in the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate contributed approximately $0.02 to second quarter EPS and primarily resulted from certain foreign tax benefits. ", "And finally diluted earnings per share of $0.65 in the quarter was down 43.5% from the $1.15 earned last year. On a sequential basis however EPS improved from the $0.60 earned in the first quarter notwithstanding $0.08 per share of higher restructuring costs in the second quarter. ", "With that I will now turn to our segment results, starting with the commercial and industrial group on slide seven, segment sales of $256.4 million declined 25.3% without currency. The deepening of the recession across most European economies and the spreading of more economic weakness to other industries had a more severe impact on the C&I segment particularly in our SNA Europe business. ", "Let me dissect the segments gross margin for the quarter as it declined from 37.9% last year to 28.6% this year. Approximately 200 basis points of this decline was due to restructuring charges of $4.9 million included in cost of sales. Approximately 550 basis points was due to excess manufacturing capacity costs due the significantly reduced production volumes. ", "We scaled back production as a result of lower customer demand including the effects of distributor destocking and to achieve greater inventory reduction. This was particularly evident at SNA Europe. The upside to these inventory reduction efforts was a $35 million inventory reduction across the C&I segment in the quarter which contributed importantly to our strong cash flow. ", "Furthermore SNA Europe selectively discounted certain products during the quarter as part of a brand consolidation strategy which reduced overall segment margin by about 50 basis points. And while we were able to achieve some level of material cost savings and RCI cost improvements, these were offset by lower volume and mix effects across the businesses. ", "Operating expenses in the quarter declined $24.3 million from prior year levels primarily due to $8.6 million of currency, lower sales volume related expenses and $6.5 million of savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. ", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I group were down $49.2 million year over year with more than half of this decline related to one business in this segment, SNA Europe.", "Turning now to slide eight, on a worldwide basis organic sales in the Snap-on tools group declined 7.5% year over year, an improvement from the comparable 10.7% decline reported in the first quarter. On a sequential basis organic sales increased 4.5% over first quarter levels. ", "In the United States Snap-on tools sales were down 8.5% year over year but did improve sequentially. Van count in the US at the end of the second quarter was flat with the first quarter and was up very modestly from last June. ", "Measured in terms of sales per van the sequential sales increase in the second quarter is about 5%, similar to the sequential increase in delivered sales off the vans as reported by our franchisees in the second quarter. All regions in the US reported sequentially higher sales off the vans. ", "As Nick said US repair spending continues to rise. We expect this to continue and aid our business. In our international franchise operations, organic sales were down 4.9% year over year. Gross margin improved to 42.4% compared to 41.9% last year. The effect of the stronger US dollar on US manufactured products sold through the international businesses reduced the gross margin by about 170 basis points and excess manufacturing costs added another 120 basis points of the margin decline. However, higher pricing realization and improved mix along with material cost reductions more than offset these negative factors. ", "Operating expenses of $81.6 million in the quarter were down 6.6% from 2008, [inaudible] savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. Currency translation contributed $2.8 million of the decline. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $28 million in the quarter declined $7.3 million from 2008 largely due to the lower sales volumes, cost to carry excess manufacturing capacity and $6.5 million due to currency. ", "As a percentage of sales operating earnings in the second quarter of 10.8% declined from the 12.1% realized a year ago. However as compared to the first quarter of 2009 operating earnings increased $6.9 million or 32.7% and the operating earnings margin of 10.8% increased 210 basis points from the first quarter. ", "Turning to the diagnostics and information group which is shown on slide nine, second quarter sales of $137 million declined 12.5% before currency primarily due to lower essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. Compared to first quarter 2009 levels however, organic sales increased 2.3% primarily due to stronger sales of diagnostics products worldwide. ", "Gross profit of $71.1 million was down $5.9 million from 2008 primarily due to the lower sales, $3.2 million of unfavorable currency and $1.8 million of higher software development costs. These declines in gross profit were partially offset by an improved sales mix and $2.3 million from savings from RCI and cost improvement initiatives. ", "Gross profit margin of 51.9% in the quarter improved considerably over 46.7% a year ago primarily due to an improved sales mix resulting from increased sales of higher margin diagnostics and software products as well as the savings from RCI. ", "As a result of this improved sales mix and $6.9 million of savings from RCI and other cost improvement initiatives operating earnings in the quarter of $34 million, [inaudible] or 9.7% from 2008 and as a percentage of sales improved from 18.8% last year to 24.8% this year. ", "As compared to first quarter 2009 levels operating earnings in the second quarter increased $8.3 million and the operating margin increased 540 basis points on a sequential basis. Turning to slide 10, financial services operating income of $16.6 million increased $5.8 million from 2008. ", "The year over year improvement is primarily due to lower market discount rates and a 2.5% increase in originations. I\u2019ll provide more detail on Snap-on credit in a moment. Now let me turn to a brief discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet, turning to slide 11, our operating cash flow performance was quite strong, about $156 million in the second quarter. ", "Inventory reduction along contributed $55 million. Capital spending of $19.5 million in the second quarter of this year included planned growth spending for our plant in Belarus, and the further expansion of our plant in Kunshan, China. ", "Last year second quarter capital spending was $17.9 million. Our current plans call for 2009 capital spending to be in a range of $60 to $70 million. As seen on slide 12 accounts receivable decreased nearly $50 million from year end levels primarily due to lower sales and continued diligence on collections. ", "Days sales outstanding were 65 days at quarter end compared to 64 days at year end. All of our businesses are continuing their vigilant efforts in managing customer credit risk in this environment. Inventories at the end of the quarter were down $55 million from last quarter and $63 million from year end excluding currency. ", "On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns declined to 4.1x from 4.6x at year end. This decline in turns is a function of the trialing nature of the computation and the fact that most of our inventory reduction occurred this quarter. At current inventory levels turns would be approximately unchanged from year end. ", "Net debt at the end of the quarter of $295 million was down $105 million from year end 2008. Our net debt to capital ratio of 18.9% compares to 25.2% at year end and 26.5% last quarter. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong. Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was about $524 million. ", "In addition to the $524 million of available cash as well as cash flows from operations we currently maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility provided by a strong diversified group of international banks which does not expire until August, 2012.", "We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter end the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we need to do so. At quarter end there was no commercial paper outstanding. ", "Now let\u2019s discuss Snap-on credit beginning on slide 13, as you know on July 16 we notified CIT that we were terminating our financial services joint venture agreement effective that day. We have since purchased CIT\u2019s 50% ownership interest in the joint venture for approximately $8.2 million. ", "The joint venture was formed in 1999. For decades before that this credit business was owned and successfully operated by Snap-on and it has always been operated as a separate business. The employees of Snap-on credit housed about 30 minutes from our corporate headquarters here will remain with Snap-on credit and the operations of Snap-on credit are expected to be uninterrupted by this event. ", "All activities surrounding the financing of extended credit contracts to customers, leases of shop equipment, and loans to franchisees will continue without change. Going forward Snap-on will provide financing for all new contracts and loans originated by Snap-on credit. The CIT owned portfolio which approximated $830 million as of the termination date will continue to be owned by CIT but serviced by Snap-on credit. ", "From an income statement perspective we will record the interest yield on new finance contracts over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue. Previously the company sold its financed contracts to CIT and the gains on the sale of these contracts were recorded as financial services revenue. ", "As a result of this change operating income of the financial services segment will decline during the transition period as we build a new portfolio of financed receivables and the associated interest yield ramps up. ", "Consequently we expect that operating income from financial services which is before interest expense and totaled $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2009 will be an operating loss of between $8 to $10 million in each of the third and fourth quarters. We anticipate that financial services will be approximately break-even by the first quarter next year producing positive and growing operating profits thereafter. ", "Based upon current origination levels, yields, credit losses, and operating expenses we believe once the transition is fully complete in 2012 the annual operating income from financial services will approximate $80 t o $85 million, again before interest costs. ", "We estimate that the incremental financing needs for Snap-on credit will be approximately $450 million over the next 12 months. As noted in both today\u2019s release and the release of July 16, we believe that we have sufficient available cash on hand, cash flow from operating activities, and available credit facilities to fund the financing needs of Snap-on credit.", "We\u2019ve provided data on slide 14 covering both the Snap-on credit portfolio in the US as well as our existing on balance sheet international portfolios for our finance businesses in the UK, Canada and Australia. Hopefully this will help demonstrate the quality of these businesses and assist you in developing your financial models. ", "This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Before we open the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. ", "Nick Pinchuk ", "Thanks Marty, while I believe the message of this quarter is that Snap-on did face headwinds but our operations achieved recording an OI margin of 12.8% before restructuring, up sequentially 160 basis points from what we believe was a fairly encouraging first quarter given the environment. ", "Looking forward we won\u2019t predict the near-term but we do continue to see opportunity in runway. Runway in our franchisee network, in auto repair garages, in critical industries, and in emerging markets and even as we work to limit the damage of this downturn on our enterprise, we continue to invest in those strategic areas. ", "We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re improving our position and will be well placed to take advantage of the future. In this quarter we also acted on a new front, taking charge of our own destiny in the credit company and while there will be a financial transition, we\u2019re confident we have the funding and the capability. ", "After all I think history shows that Snap-on has been successfully managing technician credit for decades both on and off our balance sheet. We have unique understanding of that space and we\u2019re confident we can wheel that capability to our distinct advantage going forward. ", "Before I finish here though I want to thank all of our franchisees and associates for your commitment and your effort. Your contribution to our corporation has once again been extraordinary. ", "Now we\u2019ll turn the call over for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "First question on C&I where clearly that\u2019s where the economic impact has been felt the most as you look at the actions that you\u2019ve taken there, if we go back before the economy turned over you had talked about some of the expectations for the profitability ratios in that business, do you still see longer-term or I should say could you talk about you see the C&I segment in a normalized environment from a profitability standpoint.", "Nick Pinchuk ", "Our view of C&I has not changed, what we\u2019re seeing is two big changes this quarter is one I think that we spent a lot of time talking about SNA Europe and Europe is having some difficultly. Our SNA Europe business like many other European businesses are in difficulty but we don\u2019t see that as a long-term reduction of our expectations for that business. \\", "If you just look at what\u2019s happened in Europe in the recent period, you have announcements on GDP like Spain which has got unemployment of I think almost 20%, they announced their GDP was down three, and that was the good news. France was something like 3.2 down GDP in the first quarter. UK was 4.9, Italy was 6.0, Germany was 6.9, Russia which is an extension of our Eastern European business was 9.8 so they are seeing I think the bad news for breakfast hit them that we saw, the United States saw, earlier.", "And you\u2019re seeing a lot of that hit the market. At the same time we\u2019re seeing as part of that I think we\u2019re seeing destocking continue for our distributors. So I feel that we\u2019re in a unique time in Europe. That economy will come back eventually. We believe actually we\u2019re holding or gaining share if you base distributor shelf space, if you believe the reports on distributor shelf space.", "So I think our expectations for SNA Europe continue. The industrial business was off quite substantially in the quarter but we believe the idea about taking the Snap-on brand out to mission critical industries is still quite valid and still being well received. So I think those businesses for the longer-term are still going to achieve the kind of mid double-digit earnings that we all expected. ", "", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "But when you look at the incremental restructuring that you talked about in the second half of the year do we look at another quarter of kind of break-even before seeing profitability restored, given seasonality, that seems to be the bigger\u2014", "Nick Pinchuk ", "Given seasonality I think you do look at another quarter. We\u2019re not expecting much change in the C&I. I think I said in my remarks, this is the vacation period. So this is quite an unpredictable period for us in C&I because they do have a quite a bit of European component of their business. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting near-term and when I said immediate I meant the third quarter, even if we\u2019re spending the restructuring. ", "I don\u2019t necessarily say that we\u2019re expecting much improvement, I would expect the improvement once we get off  the vacation period. Part of what I believe is happening is that because of this bad news which is being publicized in Europe its gone beyond the actuality of GDP is that distributors and customers are saying, I\u2019m going to sort of go, at least from a commercial point on view, on vacation early. ", "So I think we\u2019ll probably see a long, we saw some of the vacation creep into the second quarter I think this year and we\u2019ll probably see a pretty good strong vacation effect in the third quarter so we don\u2019t see improvement until we\u2019re coming into the end of the year in C&I.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And switching gear to diagnostics, where we\u2019ve seen a lot of good improvement mix, obviously less facilitation, more software, and maybe this more toward Marty, but how do we think about that business longer-term because of where we\u2019ve seen those margins the last two quarters. Is 20% plus kind of a normalized margin. ", "Marty Ellen ", "Let me just give you some color, as  you know the margins in that segment are significantly impacted by the mix of our businesses given the different margin structures and for example this year the whole area of diagnostics and software was about, was over 80% in terms of mix and if you go back a year ago, it was 75% and recall that the year before that the OEM facilitation business which was low margin had a large one-off program if you will involving over 8,000 dealers across Europe.", "So it is all about the mix. We actually think the diagnostics and software business is the one that has probably the greatest runway going forward because as we\u2019ve said before as repair moves for example from OE dealerships to independents, the need for those products are enormously important. ", "And given that yes we would expect our model always was for the diagnostics and information group to sort of be at or approaching that 20% level, it was obviously greater this quarter in terms of our overall goal of about mid teens operating margins. ", "Nick Pinchuk ", "I\u2019d just like to amplify on that a little bit, we have a tremendous advantage in that sector in the database we have associated with the installed car park, the wide range of badges and the number of years and models we have in our database in terms of diagnosing products and sometimes I think those of us who don\u2019t do this for a living, the value of that is lost. ", "But I recommend that you read in the New York Times Magazine, the May 24 issue, Matthew Crawford\u2019s article on the value of mechanic labor. This is a guy who was in the think tank in Washington, had a Ph.D. and then went to run a motorcycle shop and he regales you in several paragraphs of the difficulty of working on an older model and having to get advice from experienced technicians. ", "Experience trumps the rule is what he says and what we have in our diagnostics is, one of the things we have Mitchell and in some cases in things like VERUS, is our expert based systems where experienced techs, long time techs, have helped us post solutions into an automated system where our subscribers can access those if they have trouble with some of these long-term vehicles. ", "So we have a great advantage and a great lead in that situation. So the diagnostics business for us I think is going to be strong margins for some time to come. ", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And you gave us a lot of color on the credit business and the P&L impact and financing needs, but as we think about the cash flow implications particularly with the accounts receivable balance rising, how should we think about the operating cash flow impact of having credit on the balance sheet. ", "Marty Ellen ", "From an operating cash flow point of view yes, we\u2019re going to have to build what will appear in our cash flow going forward an increasing finance receivable portfolio. We said in the release and I said this morning that over the next 12 months it looks to us to be about a $450 million incremental financing need because as we build contracts each and every day they also begin to pay down. ", "So incrementally about $450 million. That will rise a little bit thereafter. That\u2019s not going to be the peak, it may be another $50 or $100 million a couple of three quarters out and so that should box for you what we see as the full financing need. ", "So its important to note that while we expect to build at least a new $800 million portfolio we don\u2019t need to finance $800 million with debt because of the cash flow from that business, Snap-on\u2019s other cash flows and by the way as we model that incremental say close to $550 million need if you dial out more than 12 months, we\u2019ve done that by also reserving what we think is adequate cash on hand for Snap-on so we don\u2019t drive our cash all the way down either. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "I was wondering if you could discuss the destocking in the commercial and industrial segment, is that something that you think is going to continue or is that going to slow as we go into the third quarter of the year. ", "Nick Pinchuk ", "I hate to say this, last time I thought, what I said last time was destocking logically can\u2019t continue. I stand by that. When it ends I don\u2019t know. We thought that it might start to abate going off the second quarter but it did not so I\u2019m not going to predict that. But logically it has to and it represents between 40% and 50% of our decrease in Europe. ", "What happened in the United States I\u2019ll tell you, if you use that as any indication, the franchisees destocked in some cases. In some cases at our urgency because we wanted them to generate cash and that took several quarters and then toward the end, in fact in the last quarter that destocking has ended. ", "So I think it probably took two or three or four, about two or three quarters in the US for that to roll out and we\u2019re probably going to see the same kind of thing or more in Europe. I\u2019m not sure. We\u2019ve seen a couple quarters of destocking already. So I guess the short answer is I can\u2019t predict. I know it represents half of our, roughly half of our downturn but we did see a model for this in the US and destocking will end its just hard to predict when. ", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And if we look at the tools group, you touched briefly on the sequential improvement there, can you just provide a little bit more color on what drove the sequential increase and how you see that trending going forward. ", "Nick Pinchuk ", "Well the sequential increase was driven in part by 4% increase quarter over quarter in sales, that was one, that helped quite a bit. And then rapid continuous improvement activities throughout those organizations, our RCI improvement, that\u2019s two. And three we\u2019re constantly innovating and launching new products which create a buzz and sometimes get us a little better margins. ", "So those three factors. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "Congratulations on a great quarter, I had a question on the CIT transition, so it sounds like you\u2019re losing the gain on sale that you get from the CIT partnership and if I understand this correctly that\u2019s about a $25 million impact per quarter starting in Q3. ", "", "Marty Ellen ", "No I think what\u2019s happening in Q3, we said on the call this morning that the next two quarters the whole segment will lose $8 to $10 million and that\u2019s of course driven by the change. We terminated on July 16 so actually there\u2019ll still be a small benefit in the third quarter because up until the 16 of July we continued to sell contracts to CIT and recognized gain for half a month. ", "So had we terminated July 1 it would have been a little worse in the third quarter improving then somewhat in the fourth quarter. ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "But if I understand correctly, so instead of reporting a gain in the financial segment of roughly $16 million in Q3 and Q4 we\u2019re going see a loss of $8 to $10 million. ", "Marty Ellen ", "That\u2019s correct, and just to remind everybody that segment includes the Snap-on credit business in the US and our international finance businesses which have always been on our balance sheet which are throwing off interest yield which is what\u2019s in financial services revenue alongside with the gains on the sale of the contracts in the US. There are operating expenses, there are loss provisions and what you see in the second quarter is $16.6 million of operating income on that basis. ", "And you are correct, what we\u2019re telling everybody is that $16.6 million in the second quarter we expect to look like an $8 to $10 million loss in each of the third and fourth quarters, break-even or so by the first quarter, ramping up thereafter as the portfolio builds. ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "So as I think about the EPS impact, that seems like from the run rate then all else equal that we\u2019ll have about a $0.25 per share in Q3 relative to Q2, is that about right after I tax the difference. ", "Marty Ellen ", "You pretty well have it. ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "Okay and then in Q1 and Q2 it sounds like the segment will break even but will be comping against a plus 16 contribution from Q1 2009 or somewhere thereabouts, is that about right. So while it won\u2019t be a $0.25 impact maybe it will be 60% of that or something like that. ", "Marty Ellen ", "That\u2019s correct and against that right now we\u2019re funding the business out of our available cash so to the extent we go into the market to raise any more debt that will change whatever you have as interest expense in your models but so far there would be no change because we haven\u2019t borrowed anything. ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "And have you pursued any other potential partners to replace CIT or do you want to keep all of this funding on your balance sheet going forward. ", "Marty Ellen ", "I think we presented the data on the slide I think to show everybody how economically strong this business has been. We did this ourselves until 1999. There were circumstances in the late 90\u2019s which caused us to believe that in essence creating some financial flexibility through that CIT program by selling the portfolio at that time made sense. ", "Snap-on had just made a number of acquisitions in the 90\u2019s and that was a way to create some liquidity, pay down debt. We\u2019re always going to be looking at the most effective way to finance the business. We think it\u2019s a great return investment for our shareholders and at the same time we will always know that that portfolio gives us some financing flexibility because they\u2019re financed assets and very financible in all sorts of forms in all sorts of capital markets transactions, with our without a joint venture structure. ", "I think the structure just came with the need at the time to look at financing, that part of our balance sheet in a different manner. That could change in the future. We have no existing plans to change that, but we do recognize that that portfolio by itself can create liquidity and give us some flexibility down the road should we need to do so. ", "And otherwise we expect it to provide great returns particularly once we get through the ramp up period. ", "Ben Carter \u2013 Southpoint Capital  ", "So in order to mitigate some of the hit we\u2019re going to take on the EPS impact have you considered trying to purchase those receivables out of CIT. ", "Marty Ellen ", "", "There have been no discussions with CIT about that.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Mr. Marty Ellen, Chief Financial Officer. You may begin your conference.", "Martin M. Ellen", "", "Thank you [Mar]. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s third quarter 2009 results.", "By now you should have seen our press release issued this morning. Joining me today is Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s CEO. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. I will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results, and afterwards we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Consistent with past practice we will use slides to help illustrate our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today\u2019s call. ", "Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. ", "This call is copyrighted material by Snap-on Incorporated. It is intended solely for the purpose of this audience. Therefore it cannot be recorded, transcribed or rebroadcast by any means without Snap-on\u2019s express permission.", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Thanks Marty. Good morning everybody. Well, the economic headwinds continue to prove challenging and in this environment Snap-on seeks to limit the impact of the uncertainty. We seek to keep improving on execution and we\u2019re going to continue investing in our prime strategic initiatives.", "In that context, I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re encouraged by our overall results and in particular with the sequential progress of both the Commercial Industrial and the Snap-on\u2019s Tools groups. Those improvements came in what is seasonally our slowest quarter, so it\u2019s clear that the period\u2019s actual performance confirms the continued strengthening of our company. The benefits of our Snap-on value creation processes were again evident over the last three months.", "Marty\u2019s going to discuss as usual the financial results in detail, but I want to take a few minutes to highlight some of the elements of the quarter to provide you a bit of perspective on what we see in our markets and to discuss our approach in navigating what are proving to be some turbulent times. ", "For the overall corporation, sales were down from last year by nearly 17%, 13.6% if you exclude the impact of currency. However, that year-over-year decline narrowed significantly from the second quarter. The third quarter\u2019s normally slow for us but in 2009 the sequential decline was only about half of what we\u2019ve seen in other years. In fact our Commercial Industrial segment or CNI actually saw sequential increase in organic sales. Now while that gain was slight, an uptick of any magnitude in the third quarter is very unusual in this segment. Remember, CNI has a substantial presence in Europe and they had to overcome the summer vacation slowdown, so we were quite encouraged by the results.", "Another positive was the sale of what we call big ticket items. This includes diagnostic products and tool storage units sold through our Snap-on Tools group. It also applies to larger capital investment type equipment; aligners, tire changers and balancers sold through the CNI group. ", "In the Tools group, handheld diagnostics sold well. Those are the units where technicians can see direct productivity benefits with their purchases and we have some great new products to induce interest in that area. At the same time, there was weakness in selling tool storage units through the franchisees. These products by their nature are more discretionary and in the current economic uncertainty, mechanics appear again reluctant to make a commitment to these type of products.", "As far as equipment, you might recall that in the second quarter we saw some moderate recovery, particularly in North America. And we\u2019re pleased that the improving trend continued in the third quarter and even Europe showed some mild strength in that product. So with big ticket items we believe the trends may indicate some strengthening. Equipment and diagnostic units, which have clear productivity benefits, seem to be showing mild gains. Tool storage, which has a less direct efficiency value, was again challenged in the period. That\u2019s the big ticket story.", "On the overall economic and business environment, we did see some positive trends. However, I think everybody would say there\u2019s still much uncertainty, especially in Europe. And as I said in this morning\u2019s release it\u2019s impossible to predict the shape or in fact the timing of any recovery. So we continue to focus on many other things that we do directly control; on improving our performance, on relentlessly driving the Snap-on value creation processes like safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or as we call it here RCI. We can\u2019t predict economic trends, but we can testify that going forward Snap-on will continue to improve in each of those areas.", "Now let\u2019s touch on the operating groups. The results in the Commercial Industrial segment were very encouraging. Every operating division in this segment showed favorable sales trends, with the year-over-year declines moderating from the prior period. Profits were up nearly $11 million from the second quarter on a $9 million increase in sales. The benefits from RCI and from restructuring both proved strong in the quarter. Even before the global downturn however, we\u2019d been working hard to lower the structural costs of our CNI businesses and were seeing the benefits.", "As previewed in July, we spent $4.5 million in the quarter on restructuring in the CNI segment, primarily in Europe. And we expect to spend a similar amount in the fourth quarter. In fact, most of the more than $15 million in restructuring incurred so far this year has been in CNI and CNI Europe, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s appropriate given the market conditions in that region. ", "As I said in prior calls however, I think it\u2019s worth noting we\u2019re not taking out significant capacity. We fully expect we\u2019ll need those capabilities when the markets inevitably turn. I think I would describe our program as controlled restructuring; not big bang cuts, but aimed at reducing structural costs and improving productivity while we still maintain our ability to serve a fully recovered customer base.", "SNA Europe, our European tool business, showed sequential profit improvement on seasonally lower sales in the period. The business there did continue to deal with distributor restocking. However, we are seeing some indication that this field inventory shrinkage is moderating. But while we may receive some benefit from that favorable trend in the future, the overall market still remains weak. Of all our businesses, SNA Europe is being impacted the most by the uncertainty.", "Even within Europe the economic conditions vary by geography, with the north generally showing more tangible signs of recovery. I think you see that in the third quarter GDP numbers. And the south remaining very weak. You may remember by the way that SNA Europe has a very strong position in Spain, which has been particularly hard hit in the downturn, unemployment nearing 20% and some of the toughest GDP metrics in the world. So in that situation, cost control is paramount for SNA Europe. And it should be expected, the operation\u2019s been focused on RCI and a number of other cost reduction activities. And we saw the benefits in the sequential progress evidenced in the past quarter.", "For the equipment business, I spoke earlier about the sales declines moderating from those experienced in the first half of the year. But in this business, the real story is RCI and innovation. Equipment also achieved some strong sequential improvements in profitability on seasonally lower sales. Cost reduction played a strong role. But new product contributed as well. And we have more new product coming in the future.", "I spoke to you last quarter about the launch of the Quadriga, the world\u2019s most advanced tire changer. We knew it was a great product and that conviction was confirmed in September when it was named by Motor Magazine as one of the top 20 [audio] for 2009. We\u2019ve said that expanding in the repair garage infrastructure is an important strategic initiative even in the downturn. Well the Quadriga is a step forward in that area.", "The third quarter also saw improvement in the North American industrial division, where we had seen a relatively large fall off in the second quarter. While year-over-year sales were down, the decline was about half of what we saw in the second quarter. And some critical customer segments, such as the government business, bounced right back. And one real bright spot was vocational training and education where we saw strength and positive comparisons even year-over-year. This is a critical area where we\u2019ve been very focused and our efforts seem to be paying dividends.", "Now moving from CNI to the Snap-on Tools group, the group\u2019s sales were down sequential about 6%, slightly better than the seasonal trend. As we\u2019ve seen through the downturn, hand tool sales with their immediate productivity boost and their short payback, have remained relatively stable. And as indicated before, big ticket items were still mixed. Segment profits however improved both sequentially and from last year, despite the lower sales. The evidence of RCI is showing in our results. ", "It\u2019s heartening, especially for our associates. They do live RCI every day and it\u2019s satisfying when they see the direct benefits of their efforts. It\u2019s also great when they\u2019re recognized for their efforts. That happened recently when our Milwaukee hand tool plant was named by Industry Week as a finalist for their Best Plant Award. That\u2019s a competition that searches across North America for excellence in manufacturing and continuous improvement. It\u2019s quite an honor for the Milwaukee plant associates and I congratulate them on their accomplishment.", "In the DNI segment sales were down organically from the second quarter by about 4.7% or $5 million. This segment tends to have sales variability from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of software releases. After the strong software sales on the second quarter, profits were down by $2 million, roughly in line with our expectation. But it\u2019s worth remembering that our DNI businesses have remained quite strong throughout the downturn.", "Another topic that\u2019s been discussed in the past and again is worth repeating is related to the term aisle in the automotive dealership segment. Everybody reads about it. While we do operate in this space, we have a limited direct dependence on this segment. Our equipment solutions activity, our products in that area, does continue to be down significantly year-over-year. Some of this relates to the lumpy program-based nature of the business. However, some can be attributed to the financial hardships of the OEM dealerships.", "Snap-on business solutions that also operates in this sector has remained reasonably solid, and we feel confident that it can find offsets in adjacent markets to limit the impact of shrinkage in the U.S. dealership population. In the end, it\u2019s again worth remembering that these divisions represent just 11% of our corporation\u2019s sales. Snap-on\u2019s overall business of course is tied primarily to vehicle repair activity, wherever it\u2019s performed, and the general fundamentals there remain strong.", "While the encouraging financial results are important, equally crucial is our progress in the strategic areas we know will be decisive for our future. Part of the way Snap-on creates value is through the processes that take advantage of our connection with customers and our tradition of innovation. We have over 4,700 vans and 3,000 direct salesmen worldwide. That\u2019s a lot of customer touches. And we flow the insights from those interactions into our innovation processes and development facilities, and it\u2019s paying off. Snap-on was again awarded three MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards and that was for the third year in a row.", "We\u2019ve already spoke about the extraordinary Quadriga Tire Changer. Also winning was the Snap-on Low Profile Ratchet and Socket Set. It\u2019s a design that\u2019s 33% shorter than the competition, allows for work in the tightest of spaces and that\u2019s a huge advantage as cars become smaller and engine compartments become tighter. The third winner was the VERUS, our fully integrated handheld diagnostics tool. Not only is it a powerful diagnostic unit, but it also provides access to the Internet, catalogs, technical forms, part specifications and repair information all available car side. ", "I just spoke about the strength of big ticket diagnostics. VERUS was a major factor. It\u2019s this type of innovation that\u2019s allowing us to weather the storm and we\u2019re committed to making investments in new products that pay benefits by making work easier and faster, by improving productivity. The success of that effort in the third quarter proves again that innovation sells even in tough economic times.", "We\u2019re also remaining diligent in maintaining the health of our franchisee network and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re seeing positive results in that area. I spoke to you last quarter about our Snap-on Stimulus Package and a number of other activities we\u2019ve taken to aid franchisees in a downturn. We\u2019re providing them with great new products like the VERUS and Low Profile Ratchets. Our training programs are showing them new ways to sell and to save. And all of this seems to be helping. Franchisee turnover is at record low levels and our van count is stable, up slightly even in these times.", "We also continue to invest in emerging markets. Construction continues on our new plant in Belarus. Also in September we opened our new tool storage facility in China within our manufacturing complex at [Quin Chong]. I was there at the opening. The new plant is state-of-the-art. The workforce is enthusiastic and capable. The quality is strong. And we believe the plant will have a great future. ", "Now Marty will talk in a minute in some detail about Snap-on Credit and about the effects of transitioning to a wholly owned finance company. I just want to point out that the move has been seamless to our customers and that\u2019s a great compliment to the team of associates that has worked so hard to bring the credit company home.", "Finally I think I want to say as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we\u2019re cautious about the environment. It is difficult to predict market movement in turbulence. Now it\u2019s true so far in 2009 Snap-on has seen great progress, authored by RCI, innovation and our other value creation processes and by our investments in the strategic areas of importance. We fully expect that that advancement will continue well into the fourth quarter and for periods well beyond.", "Now Marty will take you through the financial details. Marty?", "Marty Ellen", "", "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Reported sales in the third quarter of $582 million were down 16.6% from last year. Absent the effects of foreign currency, the year-over-year organic sales decline was 13.6%.", "As Nick said, the third quarter is seasonally low for us and sales did decline sequentially, but at a much lower seasonal rate of decline than historically experienced. Our consolidated gross profit margin of 44.8% in the quarter increased 10 basis points from last year. Major factors increasing gross margin were improved mix, particularly diagnostics and software based products, which added 90 basis points, and a 110 basis point improvement due to LIFO inventory reductions.", "We continued to carry manufacturing capacity costs due both to lower demand and to achieve targeted inventory reductions. Manufacturing capacity carrying costs, particularly in Europe, and net of cost improvements which include about $10 million of material cost reductions, caused a 50 basis point margin reduction. ", "Additionally, higher restructuring costs reduced gross margin by 70 basis points and the negative currency effect on cross border product blows reduced gross margin by another 70 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter declined $24.1 million from prior year levels, principally due to $18.7 million in savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. Lower sales volumes and currency further reduced operating expenses. ", "Pension expense increased by about $3 million in the quarter as a result of last year\u2019s decline in pension asset values. We expect a similar increase in pension expense in the fourth quarter. ", "Again this quarter currency was a headwind compared to year ago exchange rates. First, currency translation reduced reported U.S. dollar sales in the quarter by $21 million, contributing a $1.9 million decline in operating income. As I mentioned, we have currency exposure to cross border product blows, the most significant related to our Snap-on branded products manufactured in the U.S. and sold by our international franchisees. This exposure reduced gross margin by $3.9 million when compared to year ago exchange rates. So in total, currency reduced consolidated operating income in the quarter by $5.8 million on a year-over-year basis. Year-to-date currency has reduced 2009 operating income by $27.1 million when compared to last year.", "We communicated to you last quarter to expect continued higher levels of restructuring spending in response to the economic climate. In the third quarter restructuring costs of $4.7 million were up considerably from the $1.4 million recorded last year. $4.5 million of this year\u2019s restructuring relates to the commercial and industrial segment, primarily to improve the segment\u2019s cost structure in Europe. Year-to-date restructuring expenses are $15.3 million of which $12.5 million relates to the CNI segment. For the nine months, restructuring costs are up $7.3 million from last year. We intend to spend about another $5 to $7 million in the fourth quarter, with a majority of this related to the CNI segment. Our full year 2009 restructuring programs are anticipated to yield about $38 million in annualized savings.", "Before Financial Services and without restructuring charges in both years, our 2009 third quarter operating margin was 10.1% compared to 11.9% last year. We believe our RCI, restructuring and other cost containment actions are enabling us to maintain reasonable margin performance during this prolonged recession. ", "As communicated during the sequential call we expected that Financial Services would incur an operating loss this quarter as a result of the July 16 termination of the Financial Services joint venture agreement with CIT. The operating loss in the third quarter for Financial Services was $5.3 million. This compares to operating income of $4.8 million last year. We\u2019ll cover Financial Services in more detail later.", "You should also note that included with today\u2019s press release are supplemental earnings and balance sheet schedules which separate our Financial Services segment from the operations of Snap-on. Interest expense in the quarter increased $6 million year-over-year as a result of higher debt levels. In the first quarter we issued $300 million of fixed rate 5 and 10 year unsecured notes and in the third quarter we issued $250 million of fixed rate 12 year unsecured notes. The proceeds from these debt issuances are being used for general corporate purposes and most importantly for the funding of Snap-on\u2019s Credit\u2019s on balance sheet financed receivables. ", "Our third quarter effective income tax rate was 29.3% as compared to 33.4% in the prior year period. The lower effective tax rate primarily resulted from the resolution of certain tax matters, increased earnings associated with non-controlling interests which are not taxable to Snap-on, and a shift in geographic mix of earnings. The effect of the lower tax rate contributed approximately $0.02 to third quarter EPS. ", "And finally, net earnings of $25.4 million or $0.44 per diluted share declined $29.2 million. Of this decline, almost half or $13.8 million was due to the aggregate effects the decline in Financial Services earnings, higher restructuring costs and higher interest expense.", "With that I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial and Industrial group on Slide 7, segment sales of $265.4 million declined 17.2% without currency, primarily due to the continued global recession and distributor de-stocking. Gross margin in the CNI segment of 30.6% was down from the 37.6% achieved last year. Approximately 140 basis points of the decline was due to $3.5 million of higher restructuring charges. Manufacturing capacity carrying costs primarily at our SNA Europe tools business, net of material cost reductions and RCI improvements, contributed most of the remainder of the gross margin decline. ", "As you know we have scaled back production in light of lower customer demand and to achieve greater inventory reduction and cash flow. The upside to this under-absorption of manufacturing expenses was an additional $22 million inventory reduction, excluding currency, across the CNI segment in the quarter which contributed importantly to our strong cash flow. Since year end 2008, inventories in the CNI segment excluding currency have been reduced by nearly $62 million. ", "Operating expenses in the quarter declined $16 million from prior year levels, principally due to savings from ongoing RCI, restructuring and other cost containment initiatives of $7.1 million, lower sales related expenses and $4.1 million due to currency. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the CNI group declined $29.8 million year-over-year, although sequentially operating earnings improved by $10.8 million.", "Turning now to Slide 8, on a worldwide basis organic sales in the Snap-on Tools group declined 7.1% year-over-year. In the U.S. Snap-on tool sales were down 8.1% year-over-year. Van count in the U.S. increased slightly compared to both the second quarter this year and the third quarter last year. In our international franchise operations, organic sales were down 3.1% year-over-year. ", "Gross margin the Snap-on Tools group increased to 44.8% compared to 42.4% last year. This increase is primarily due to material cost reductions of $6 million and higher LIFO related inventory benefits as a result of inventory reductions. Since year end the Snap-on Tools group has reduced inventory levels by $34 million excluding currency. These improvements to gross margin were partially offset by foreign currency effects on U.S. manufactured products, which reduced the year-over-year gross margin by about 200 basis points.", "Operating expenses of $79.8 million in the quarter were down $6.4 million or 7.4% from 2008, primarily due to $7.4 million of savings from RCI and other cost containment initiatives. As a result of these items, operating earnings in the quarter were $30.6 million, representing 12.4% of sales and were up 8.5% from last year and were up 9.3% sequentially.", "Turning to the Diagnostics and Information group, which is shown on Slide 9, third quarter sales of $132 million declined 12.6% before currency, primarily due to lower essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit margin of 52.1% in the quarter improved considerably over 45.5% a year ago, benefiting from increased sales of higher margin diagnostics and software products. RCI and other cost improvements also contributed to the increase. These gross margin improvements, coupled with $6.6 million of operating expense reductions, resulted in a substantial year-over-year improvement in operating margin, 24.2% compared to 17.5% last year.", "Turning to Slide 10, Financial Services incurred an operating loss of $5.3 million in the third quarter. This compares to operating income of $4.8 million in the prior year. As previously communicated, we terminated our U.S. Financial Services joint venture with CIT on July 16 and purchased CIT\u2019s ownership interest in Snap-on Credit for $8.1 million. Under the JV, Snap-on Credit sold new contract originations and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as Financial Services revenue. Since July 16, Snap-on is providing financing for new contract originations and is recording as revenue the interest yield on the on balance sheet finance portfolio. Snap-on Credit continues to service the receivables owned by CIT. In the early stages of building the portfolio of new contracts on our books, there is insufficient interest yield to cover the fixed operating expenses of Snap-on Credit. As a result, we experienced an operating loss in the third quarter and expect to report an operating loss of $3 to $5 million in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to Slide 11, at the end of the third quarter our balance sheet includes gross finance receivables of $255 million, including $130 million for Snap-on Credit. Of this amount $112 million are extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on Credit continues to manage the runoff portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which was $722 million at quarter end. In the fourth quarter we expect the incremental cash requirement for Snap-on Credit to be about $122 million and about $400 million in total through the third quarter of next year. We believe that we have sufficient available cash on hand, cash flow from operating activities and available credit facilities to fund the financing needs of Snap-on Credit.", "The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends are in line with our expectations. ", "Before we turn to a discussion of our cash flow and balance sheet, I should first point out that when you examine our detailed cash flow statement included with this morning\u2019s press release, you will see cash flows associated with contract receivables as well as cash flows associated with finance receivables. Contracts receivable include loans and leases to our franchisees and other customers. These are included in cash flows from operating activities. The cash flow consequences associated with finance receivables represent loans to technicians who are not our customers but are customers of our franchisees. These are included in cash flows from investing activities.", "Now turning to Slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow was $80 million for the quarter and $250 million for the first nine months, both substantially ahead of the year ago amounts. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, which is principally working capital, contributed $32 million of cash flow in the quarter and $72 million year-to-date. Free cash flow from operations, exclusive of Financial Services, but after capital spending, was $83 million for the quarter compared to $4 million last year and $180 million year-to-date compared to $110 million last year. Free cash flow from Financial Services was as expected an outflow in the quarter of $130 million.", "In the quarter, capital spending of about $15 million included planned growth spending for our plant in Belarus and for the completion of our tool storage manufacturing addition in our existing facility in [Quin Chong] China. We continue to expect 2009 capital spending to be in a range of $60 to $70 million.", "As seen on Slide 13, trade receivables decreased $64 million from year end levels primarily due to lower sales and continued diligence on collections. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables were 59 days at quarter end compared to 58 days at year end. All of our businesses are continuing their vigilant efforts in managing customer credit risk in this environment.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were down $17 million from last quarter and down $73 million from year end. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns were 4 times but were 4.4 times when measured over the last three months, given the more recent and significant inventory reductions. ", "Net debt at the end of the quarter was $360 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 21.5% compares to 25.2% at year end and 18.9% last quarter. ", "Cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $709 million. In addition to our cash on hand and cash flows from operations, we currently maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility provided by a strong, diversified group of international banks. This does not expire until August, 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter end the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we need to do so. At quarter end no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong. ", "This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "", "Thanks Marty. Let me end as I began. The third quarter was another encouraging period for Snap-on. Sequential results were ahead of the usual seasonal trend. And while we do seem to be on a somewhat favorable trajectory, we are cautious regarding the prediction of the timing of an economic recovery. ", "Historically the third quarter is an unreliable indicator of near term event. But what we can forecast with confidence, however, is that customer connection, innovation, RCI and Snap-on\u2019s other value creation processes will continue to drive improvement. What I can assure you is that we will keep investing in decisive, strategic areas, strengthening our van network, penetrating garage infrastructure, expanding in critical industries and building in emerging markets. And what we can predict is that Snap-on\u2019s position will continue to strengthen going forward despite the economic eventualities.", "In closing, I will recognize that there are many associates and franchisees listening to this call. I thank you all for your dedication to our team, for your support of our initiatives and for your extraordinary contributions to our progress.", "Now we\u2019ll open the line to questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Pinchuk. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Nick, I don\u2019t necessarily want to belabor this but could we dig a little bit deeper into what you\u2019re seeing in Europe since clearly that\u2019s an important area and a lot of the indicators show that that is lagging some of the stabilization that we\u2019re beginning to see in North America. And in particular, even if it\u2019s anecdotal, color or evidence you can provide on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the inventory levels and de-stocking levels.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure Jim. You know I was just there about 10 days ago. What we saw was some moderation of de-stocking but it still continues. You might remember in the second quarter we said you know something like half our year-over-year reduction was due to de-stocking. And that\u2019s moderated somewhat. And so we did get an improvement on a year-over-year basis, though modest. So we saw some narrowing of that. I think for the Hand Tools business the on-the-street positioning is still pretty weak. So the improvement we saw, and it was small, but the improvement we saw had to do with some ending of that de-stocking. ", "We should see that continue, but you know I predicted I thought in the first quarter it would end quicker than it did. So we still see the shrinkage.  I\u2019m not sure when it\u2019s going to end but logically it has to. If you look at the distributor base, one encouraging thing for us is we actually don\u2019t see many of our direct customers going away. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re actually not doing much in the way of capacity reduction. We believe the market will come back once the economies become more robust. And most of my comments here have to do with SNA Europe, the Hand Tools business, the sort of on-the-street business. One small sign of good news we saw was that the equipment business, the infrastructure business around equipment and garage infrastructure, did show some improvement in this quarter. And so in places where you have strong technology argument, strong productivity demonstration, we saw in this quarter for the first time this year we were making inroads in selling. So that might also be a positive.", "But these are very weak indicators. Like I said in my remarks, I hate to make any judgments based on third quarters in Europe. So what we\u2019re saying going forward is mild encouragement out of Europe.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "", "If we look at the Tools business, can you speak to, you know in the past you\u2019ve alluded to same-store sales but maybe talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in the dealer base in terms of how they\u2019re managing their own working capital?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, well we\u2019re seeing some small de-stocking in the dealer base as well as on the franchisee base as well, our almost 3,500 franchisees in the United States. But that\u2019s actually often at our urging. We like to see them do that. So I think I started saying back even in the fourth quarter of last year that we started out trying to urge them. So a small factor in our results is that de-stocking. ", "What we did see was some mild positives. And we did see some big ticket items come back. One of the good things about the quarter was that I think how you interpret this is, if you have a productivity story to sell, like in equipment or diagnostics, we\u2019re seeing people start to think they may want to invest. That\u2019s how we\u2019re interpreting the better news in equipment and diagnostics in the quarter.", "I think tellingly tool storage, which is as you know a little more discretionary, still stayed weak. We saw a burst of hope and you know first the good news in the second quarter where tool storage was up, but I think what we\u2019re seeing is a little thawing in North America with that regard. ", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "", "And then you know switching gears, talking a little bit of the growth opportunity, you\u2019ve given us a lot of color in the past about I mean obviously innovation is key and you\u2019ve given us a little bit of color, but could you give us an update on the emerging market as well as market expansion, how those activities are going?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well emerging markets, what\u2019s happening to us in emerging markets is we\u2019re growing very well in India and China where the GDP\u2019s are pretty strong. I think the GDP in China in the second quarter was 7.9 and India was 4.8. And we\u2019re growing faster than that. We\u2019re continuing to struggle at least in the first three quarters in places like Indonesia, Philippines, Southeast Asia. And I could go market-by-market and give you reasons why those economies are having some difficulty. And so that\u2019s the sort of landscaping around there. We\u2019re getting a little bit of boost out of China and India though, so we feel pretty positive about that. ", "But as you know we\u2019re still developing our product lines in those areas. We\u2019re putting the physicals in place and we\u2019re developing product lines. Still I remain pretty positive about that.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "", "And you\u2019ve talked you know some of the mobile tool crib for the oil and gas side, the wind opportunities.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. What we saw there was, embedded in my remarks was you know we took a big down in industry pretty much across the board. You might remember. I\u2019ll just give you some history is that all through last year and the fourth quarter I think we were up 14% year-over-year in that whole area, because we\u2019re penetrating that business. And we really saw some drop-off in the first and second quarter. In fact, year-over-year\u2019s in the second quarter for the Industrial business was down 30%. This time it was down roughly half of that. So we were encouraged by that. And we saw some sectors come back. Education, some government investment, and we saw some upticks in some of the other places. But you know places like wind, I think places like mobile tool cribs, places like aerospace, still a little weak for us. ", "We remain confident, though. We remain confident that that\u2019s going to come back. If you look at things like, and when I say weak you know let\u2019s say natural resources, which would be mobile tool cribs and mining and oil and gas, that was down versus the second quarter only about 1%. So the sequential was a little bit better. So we see some thawing there but I hesitate to say anything because there could be big winds going, big winds as in you know the blowing of winds, in that area. ", "What we see going forward in the Industrial business I think is further penetration of those segments like aerospace, natural resources, power generation, education, government, that will as the downturn moderates we will overcome that weak economy even in a down market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "On the emerging markets, just a couple of follow ups on there. Nick if you could frame that for us, you know it\u2019s a fairly new area for Snap-on just a few years ago, but what\u2019s your expectations for what that part of the business is going to be if you look out five years or ten years, you know looking at the other areas you\u2019ve been involved in and what you think that opportunity eventually is?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well my view is we have about right now this business will at least be in the next ten years as big as our European businesses, at least as big as our European businesses. That\u2019s my expectation. What happens is in emerging markets, David, in my experiences, what you actually [audio impairment] a couple of cycles you build the infrastructure, you set up your distribution, you start winning customers, you put product lines in place, you start to understand this and you kind of create a hockey stick sort of toward the end. I hate to say a hockey stick but that\u2019s the way it\u2019s worked in all my experience in 11 years in Asia. ", "Now when we look at the markets, they are pretty strong. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity and we don\u2019t see the competition being that tough. It\u2019s very fragmented. You know if you just look at the automotive industry, the car part in the world, 70% of the world\u2019s growth in car park will occur in the next five years in emerging markets.", "So it\u2019s going to be very big for us. What you see us now is just building our physicals. We\u2019re putting the plants in place. We\u2019re engaging with customers. And actually developing a product line is not a small task in doing this. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So I see the next ten years being as big as Europe.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "So if you take those I guess four steps, you know infrastructure, distribution and product customer, it sounds like you\u2019re really at the first steps there in most of these markets. Is that correct?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Right. Well, you\u2019re always building infrastructure but we have a pretty good infrastructure in place now which we have the elements of an infrastructure in place now. Now what we need to do is start to engage a stronger and broader product line and develop our customer base. When I\u2019m talking about this, I\u2019m talking about China and Asia, you know Southeast Asia and China. We are not so far along in India. We have to be better in India and we are not so far along in Russia, so we have to build our infrastructure in those places as well. So if you\u2019re talking about China, if you\u2019re talking about Southeast Asia, if you\u2019re talking about North Asia, our infrastructure\u2019s pretty good. We\u2019re building our product line and we have the rudiments of a distribution, we\u2019re starting to build the product line and engage customers. If you\u2019re talking about India and Russia, we\u2019re still developing our infrastructure.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "If we look at you know the seasonal pattern here where you\u2019ve had an uptick I guess, is there a way you can characterize it across these three elements? How much of it is just you know this  inventory cycle and you know end up de-stocking or replenishment if you will. Are the end markets doing better and market share? Is there any way you can characterize it?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "What were the three again? Sorry, you broke up, David, please.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "End markets, inventories and market share.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "You know I would say number one, of course probably everybody on a call like this would say number one was market share. But I think that we have evidence to believe that in our CNI business you\u2019re taking market share, if you look at our equipment businesses, if you look at our Industrial businesses, even SNA Europe can make a case for that. So I think that\u2019s a fairly significant piece of it. I think the de-stocking, inventory correction shrinkage is the lowest piece. In terms of markets thawing, I would say that\u2019s second, of course. So first share gain, second markets thawing a little bit because we do see some positives. ", "For example, I\u2019ll give you just a little bit of a thumbnail. In North America in the equipment business you know we\u2019ve seen continued difficulty in the chains like Goodyear and those people. We\u2019re not selling much to those people. But in terms of the independent garages, we\u2019re starting to sell equipment where we weren\u2019t in the second quarter and the first quarter. So that\u2019s a little bit of a comeback for us. I don\u2019t know if you say market share or, I don\u2019t know where the breakdown is between market share and the thawing of the market. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re gaining market share and I suspect the market is thawing a little bit as well.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Just a clarification on that on your big ticket items on the equipment side, how much do you think you\u2019re down from the peak?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Oh.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "60%, 70% maybe?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "60% or 70%?", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "Yes.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. But look I\u2019ll say that we\u2019re down let\u2019s say from the peak probably about 25%. ", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "", "On Financial Services, it looks like the loss that you reported here is certainly less than what we were expecting. I just wonder is there something we missed there or something in terms of there\u2019s a cost allocation there and what our expectations should be going forward.", "Marty Ellen", "No, we did a little better as even we predicted, principally because of a lower level of certain payments we anticipated, making the CIT as support portfolio runs off. So our modeling was a little off there. We did tell all of you to think about a $3 to $5 million loss in the fourth quarter and I will remind you that while that doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an improvement, you should not forget that included in the $5.3 million loss this quarter we still had gains on sales of contracts sold up through July 16 which were about $4 million. So had we not had those, the loss would have been closer to $9 million. So you see about a $5 million improvement, quarter over quarter, which should sort of reconcile back based on the numbers we\u2019ve given you to about the ramp up in interest yield.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Siever Wong] \u2013 H.F.P. Capital.", "[Siever Wong] \u2013 H.F.P. Capital", "I want to kind of go back to the emerging markets, in terms of progress for the segments is CNI ahead of SNA or the other, where in I guess Asia and China and I guess say Russia where you haven\u2019t really built it out yet, can you give us an idea of progress for the segments? And then maybe profitability compared to the overall company?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well profitability versus the overall company in emerging markets is lower because we\u2019re in investment modes. So that is several hundred basis points lower than the average. You can just take that to the bank pretty much as you view it. That\u2019s I think a given. And our growth in the emerging markets, all I\u2019ll say is that in the quarter versus Quarter 2 we were up in emerging markets over Quarter 2. And we made some pretty strong double digit growth rate in that quarter. Now it\u2019s a small base you know. Our Asia Pacific business is under 10% of our business. So it\u2019s not a very big piece of our business.", "And I already said that China and India are off and we\u2019re struggling a little bit in Southeast Asia. So that should give you some color around it.", "[Siever Wong] \u2013 H.F.P. Capital", "But is CNI kind of more trust there or is it more you know independent technicians over there, too?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. It\u2019s a CNI trust. In other words the emerging markets are all within CNI, Asia Pacific is within CNI.", "[Siever Wong] \u2013 H.F.P. Capital", "", "And then Marty, in the previous call you had also kind of given us an idea of what to expect for the first quarter of 2010, you said it was probably going to be breakeven. Is that kind of on schedule still?", "Marty Ellen", "That\u2019s still on track.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Surrell - Conning Asset Management.", "Steve Surrell - Conning Asset Management", "", "I\u2019m just wondering as you think about this finance business, what kind of leverage you\u2019re using internally for that business.", "Marty Ellen", "Yes, you see in our targeted leverage which is based upon our assessment of the loss experience in the portfolio, and in an effort to try to create a capital structure inside Financial Services that we think if it were sort of stand alone rated could support an A rating, would be 5 to 1 leverage. Now when you look at this morning\u2019s press release and you look at the separate balance sheet for the global Financial Services business you\u2019ll of course see lower leverage, about $92 million in debt and $172 million of equity. So what you\u2019re really looking at there is a mixture. That is 5 to 1 leverage but only on the U.S. assets. The international assets are at least for the time being effectively un-levered, but we will probably change that going forward.", "Steve Surrell - Conning Asset Management", "", "Can you provide for this quarter or going forward you know some delinquency or non-performer or write-off kind of?", "Marty Ellen", "We\u2019ve given that in the slides this morning and you may not have seen those. Slide 11.", "Operator", "And Mr. Ellen we have no other questions in the queue at the moment. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Marty Ellen", "We thank you all for joining us this morning and for your interest in Snap-on.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d just like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. As Mark said, my name is Leslie Kratcoski and I joined Snap-on in December. I\u2019ve already have the pleasure of speaking with several of you, and I do look forward to meeting and working with all of you.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Ellen, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Marty will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. Afterwards, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "As usual we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our Web site next to the audio icon for this call.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, 2009 is in the book and we finished the year with another quarter of progress. The Tools Group and the Commercial & Industrial Group both ended with sequential improvements. So while we were challenged throughout the year, we were encouraged again by the fourth quarter results. We believe that it is fair to say that the Snap-on team extended its ongoing trend of operating improvement and of strategic progress.", "In the fourth quarter, our overall operating margin of 11.5% before financial services was our highest of the year and it was more than 200 basis points up from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And while the earnings are below the 2008 record fourth quarter levels, we did finish 2009 with a relatively strong performance and we are well positioned for the opportunities as they unfold going forward.", "Marty will take you through the financials in a minute, but first I\u2019ll provide some perspective on the market environment, cover some of the operating highlights and discuss just how we are managing through the uncertain times.", "For the overall corporation, excluding currency which now has turned positive for us, fourth quarter sales were down 11.1% from 2008. There was an overall 5% sequential increase from the third quarter, but that\u2019s about in line with normal seasonality. I think it\u2019s fair to say that on balance we believe the markets have stabilized, but overall they are not yet clearly rebounding. In that however, there are some mild good news. We believe that distributor destocking is behind us, and we did see some modest strengths with stronger than seasonally normal sequential sales increases from our industrial division; however, Europe in general continues to lag, not showing any significant signs of recovery. The distributors there appear to be reluctant to begin restocking.", "I believe you will know by now that we closely monitor big ticket items, diagnostic products and tool storage units sold through our van channel and under-car equipment sold through the C&I Group. These are high-value purchases that are either more discretionary or have a longer payback, and we believe they can be a reasonable barometer of the overall market environment. And by extension, they can be a gauge of the general confidence level for our various customers, customers like garage owners who are in themselves small businessmen, trying to forecast the future before making investments in longer-term items. Here again, the science for us are mixed.", "Equipment continued mildly favorable trends, but tool storage and diagnostics were down slightly showing no recovery. So as I said a mild favorability but no broad upswing. So in this uncertain environment we will continue to balance the need for operating improvement, balance that need with the investment in growth areas of strategic importance. We remain focused on the elements of our Snap-on value creation, areas like rapid continuous improvement or RCI, as we call it, innovation, customer connection, safety and quality. Those are the processes that have been so transformative in helping us weather this difficult environment and weather it with encouraging results.", "Speaking of results, our full-year organic sales were down 14% from 2008, but we\u2019re reasonably encouraged that we are able to limit the impact of that downturn. On a sales decrease of about $390 million, the operating income change was contained to $118 million and that included an additional $7 million of restructuring spend. We believe that\u2019s a strong testament to the improvements we\u2019ve continue to make even in the turbulent times.", "Throughout the past year, we also continued to focus on those areas we believe will be strategically decisive for Snap-on for our operations going forward, maintain the health for our franchise network, expanding our presence in vehicle repair infrastructure segments, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage and into other mission-critical arenas and strengthening our physical capability in emerging markets. During the quarter and throughout the year we continue to invest and advance along each of those crucial dimensions.", "So now let\u2019s move on to a discussion of the operating groups and of their progress in those strategic areas. The C&I Group posted its strongest quarter of the year with operating income of $21.7 million. As expected, we spent $5.7 million in the quarter on restructuring in that segment, primarily in Europe. SNA Europe, our European-based tools business; that operation continues to experience some of the largest sales declines in the segment, and that reflects the market, the operation it serves, and its strong concentration in the South of Europe which has been particularly hard hit by the recession. I think Spain still has a 17% or 18% unemployment rate, so it\u2019s understandable. Appropriately therefore that business incurred the majority of the restructuring expense in the quarter.", "At SNA Europe, we are taking aggressive actions. We are acting to contain costs and to permanently reduce fixed expense while not taking out capacity because we believe the capacity will be needed when the markets recover. With the volume decline, inventory reduction efforts and restructuring costs, SNA Europe accounted for a major slice of C&I\u2019s fourth quarter income decline from 2008.", "On the other hand, the results from the other C&I businesses in fourth quarter were fairly positive despite the market environment and a volume decline \u2013 despite that volume decline. Through RCI and reaping the benefits of past restructuring actions, the remaining C&I business had essentially offset the impact of the decline, an encouraging performance given the times, we believe. For example, the industrial division; now before the downturn this is a business that was expanding nicely and had achieved record sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales were down in 2009 versus that record.", "There remains, however, continuing opportunity in industrial that we believe will accelerate in a sustained recovery. Mission-critical industries like railroads, aerospace, educational institutions, the military, emerging industries like wind power, these customers value the Snap-on brand reputation for productivity, reliability, and repeatability and they are embracing Snap-on innovation. Our industrial division registered significant wins in the past quarter in all of the industries I\u2019ve mentioned and its sales showed double-digit sequential increase ahead of normal seasonality.", "We also saw some positive trends in equipment division, especially in North America, a strong seasonal increase versus the third quarter. As I said in the past, when it comes to innovation and RCI equipment is one of our great success story. In the fourth quarter, sales of alignment equipment were a real bright spot for us. Our Imaging Alignment technology is second to none and we believe that advantage is helping us gain share in the strategically important garage infrastructure space.", "The equipment business also made some fine improvements in the quarter in RCI, process cost reduction, design cost improvements and purchasing savings. They all combine to make equipment one of the big drivers of C&I profitability in the period.", "Moving on to the Tools Group where the fourth quarter was also the strongest of 2009. Earnings increased both sequentially and from the prior year. In fact, the fourth quarter operating income margin of 13.2% is the second highest recorded for any quarter by the Tools Group in over five years, encouraging given the sales levels. Sales were up about 2% from the third quarter, that\u2019s about in line with normal seasonality; and while we are not seeing recovery on big ticket items, our hand tools continue to perform solidly, of course I think \u2013 I am sure I said this in the past that hand tools are the products where users can see the most immediate productivity increase and the quickest payback. So it stands to reason that Snap-on will perform well in that product line even in these times.", "Repair work after all is reasonably strong, the mechanics have cash, they may not have great visibility to the days ahead, but they are willing to spend in making today\u2019s job easier and more productive and they are doing just that with Snap-on hand tools.", "In the past, I mentioned the importance of supporting our franchisees\u2019 network and ensuring it remains strong. This was a strategic focus for us as we entered the downturn and as we managed through it; and we have had success in that goal both in the fourth quarter and throughout 2009. A number of actions we call Snap-on\u2019s franchisees\u2019 stimulus program seems to be working. Man count has held firm now for several quarters and our van turnover, our franchisee turnover continues at historical all-time lows.", "I will let Marty cover the finance company in detail but I will just say that the integration of Snap-on Credit is moving forward on plan without disruption to our customers and our franchisees. The credit company is a powerful asset to supporting our franchisees and maintaining that advantage was a key win for us in 2009.", "Now a word about Diagnostics & Information or D&I; that group had another relatively solid quarter. Organic sales were down from 2008 by 16.6% or $25.7 million and as in past quarters the declines were focused primarily at equipment solutions, or EQS, and Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS. Those are the businesses most directly impacted by the turmoil in the OEM dealership space in North America.", "Having said that, though, RCI and other cost reduction activities had limited the damage and kept operating income levels strong at $30 million for the period representing 23.2% of sales for the group. Beyond that, we are starting to see some glimmer of positive activity from the OEMs. They do seem to be moving forward with selected essential tool programs that have upside for EQS; and SBS, though challenged by dealership consolidation, is having some success in offsetting the declines with sales outside North America and in near adjacent markets, places like commercial vehicles and construction equipments.", "And through our handheld diagnostics business and Mitchell 1, Snap-on is expanding its presence in the garage infrastructure segment, providing integrated solutions, offering productive enhancements to the growing independent shop segment throughout North America.", "I think it is important to remember again that Snap-on is tied to auto repair rather than to the overall auto manufacturing industry, and we believe that the fundamental drivers of that repair segment remain positive. Miles driven are rising again and household spending on automotive repairs is increasing. The indicators remain favorable for the future for that sector.", "I will wrap up with emerging markets. We have been committed to moving forward on initiatives in Asia and Eastern Europe; we have been committed throughout the year, we have added distribution capabilities and launched new products, specifically designed for those new markets from band saws to power tools to under-car equipment; and then in the third quarter, we opened a new tool storage manufacturing facility in China and we launched our new plant in Belarus in the fourth quarter. With that Minsk plant, we not only added capabilities but we also created advantage in our cost structure. So those ongoing investments amidst this uncertain environment, we believe demonstrate our commitment to emerging markets. It also speaks to our balanced approach in managing through the turbulence pursuing cost reduction while investing for strategic advantage.", "Now I will turn the call over to Marty to cover the financials in more detail. Marty?", "Marty Ellen", "Thanks, Nick. I will begin with our consolidated operating results which are shown on slide six. Sales in the fourth quarter of $618 million increased 6.2% sequentially from the third quarter. Without currency, sales were up sequentially 5%. As compared to last year, reported sales in the quarter were down 7.4%; and absent foreign currency effects, organic sales declined 11.1% year over year. As Nick said, we were encouraged by the sequential sales increase in the quarter in light of the continued headwinds particularly affecting certain markets in Europe.", "Consolidated gross profit margin of 46% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from last year.", "Because of lower production volumes, primarily in Europe, excess capacity costs continue to pose a challenge; however, we were more than able to offset those with material cost reductions, savings from our RCI initiatives, benefits of cash restructuring and other cost reductions. The net effect was a 200 basis point gross margin improvement in the quarter.", "Gross margin was further aided by better sales mix, particularly in the Diagnostics & Information segment, which improved consolidated gross margin by another 110 basis points. On the downside restructuring costs, included in gross profit, reduced the gross margin by 85 basis points and currency when measured on a year-over-year basis reduced gross margin by another 90 basis points.", "LIFO gains in the quarter from our continued inventory reduction efforts were offset by certain higher inventory provisions and the liquidation of slower moving items. Operating expenses in the quarter of $213 million were up $1.8 million from prior year. We achieved $19.2 million from cost reduction and cost containment actions. We also benefitted from $4.7 million of lower restructuring costs that are recorded in operating expenses. These improvements allowed us to more than offset higher pension expense, higher mark-to-market incentive compensation expense, unfavorable currency of $7.4 million and certain other expense increases. Also, last year\u2019s expenses did benefit by $5.4 million from a favorable pre-acquisition contingency adjustment at Snap-on Business Solutions.", "Total restructuring costs in both the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 were $6.7 million with the majority of this year\u2019s relating to the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I segment. For the full-year, restructuring charges of $22 million were up $7.3 million from 2008. Of this $22 million, $18.2 million was in the C&I segment, primarily to improve the segment\u2019s cost structure in Europe.", "As communicated during the third quarter call, we expected that financial services would again incur an operating loss this quarter following the July16 termination of the joint venture with CIT. The operating loss in the fourth quarter for financial services was $3.8 million, which was within the range previously communicated to you. We will cover financial services in more detail later including the dispute with CIT that was disclosed in today\u2019s press release.", "Again, with this quarter\u2019s press release we have included supplemental earnings and balance sheet schedules, which separate our financial services segment from the other operations of Snap-on. This will now be our standard practice.", "Interest expense in the quarter increased $6 million year over year as a results of higher debt levels.", "In 2009, we issued $550 million of fixed rate long-term notes. The proceeds on these notes are being used for general corporate purposes and most importantly for the funding of Snap-on Credits on balance sheet portfolio. After the year-end, we did repay $150 million of floating rate notes that matured in January.", "Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.4% compares favorably to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. And finally, net earnings of $36.6 million or $0.63 per diluted share increased 44.1% sequentially from the third quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 net earnings declined $22 million or 37.5%. Of this decline, $13.5 million resulted from the after-tax impact of lower financial services earnings, as well as higher interest expense.", "With that I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide seven, segment sales of $302 million improved 13.9% sequentially from third quarter levels. Compared to last year, organic sales in the quarter declined 12.2% primarily due to the continued economic downturn that is particularly affecting certain European markets, most notably Spain.", "On a year-over-year basis, equipment sales in North America were up mid single digits and sales in Asia were up mid double digits. Gross margin in the C&I segment was 33.6%. Before $4.7 million of restructuring charges, gross margin was 35.2% down 230 basis points on a comparable basis with last year. The effects of sales mix and excess capacity costs created by lower production volumes including our inventory reduction efforts were partially offset by material and other cost reductions resulting in a net reduction in gross margin of a 155 basis points. Since year-end 2008, inventories in the C&I segment, excluding currency, were reduced by $76 million.", "Operating expenses in the quarter declined $4.6 million from prior year. This improvement is principally due to savings from ongoing restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives of $6.5 million, as well as lower sales volume related expenses. Currency translation increased operating expenses by $4.2 million.", "Operating earnings for the quarter of $21.7 million include $5.7 million of restructuring charges. Before restructuring, the operating margin was 9.1% compared to 12.4% on a comparable basis in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and improved from 5.3% on a comparable basis with the third quarter of 2009.", "Turning now to slide eight; on a world-wide basis, organic sales in the Snap-on Tools Group declined 3.7%, year over year. Van count in the US at year end was comparable to both the third quarter 2009 as well as year-end 2008. In our international franchise operations, organic sales in the quarter were down 3.5%.", "Gross margin in the Snap-on Tools Group increased to 45.4% in the quarter compared to 41.6% last year. Without restructuring costs in both years the gross margin improvement was about 340 basis points. Currency reduced gross margin by about 100 basis points. Material cost reductions and favorable factory utilization rates against last year significantly improved gross margin by about 385 basis points.", "Fourth quarter inventory reductions resulted in LIFO gains of about $6.7 million, but this was offset by increased inventory provisions and the liquidation of slower moving items. Operating expenses in the quarter were down $4.4 million from 2008, notwithstanding currency headwinds of $2.5 million. Expenses declined due to lower volume and from savings of $8.5 million due to RCI initiatives, benefits from prior restructuring actions, and other cost containment initiatives.", "Also restructuring costs recorded in operating expenses were lower by $2.9 million. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2 % in the quarter improved significantly from both 7.8% last year and 11.9% in the third quarter. Before restructuring costs, operating earnings improved 39.2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year on a comparable basis.", "Turning to the Diagnostics & Information, or D&I Group, which is shown on slide nine; fourth quarter sales of $129 million declined 15.6%. Before currency, the decline was 16.6%. The segment sales decline was primarily due to lower sales to OEM dealerships.", "Gross profit margin of 53.2% in the quarter improved considerably over 46.7% a year ago benefiting from an improved sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products. RCI and other cost improvements more or less offset $2 million of higher amortized product development costs.", "Operating earnings of $30 million in the quarter for the D&I Group declined $4.3 million from prior year. Last year\u2019s operating income included a $5.4 million reduction of a pre-acquisition contingent liability associated with Snap-on Business Solutions. Cost savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives more than offset the income decline from the lower sales.", "Now turning to slide 10; the comparisons for financial services reflect the July 16 termination of the Snap-on Credit joint venture with CIT. Since that date, we no longer sell contracts to CIT and record gains on sale. Rather, we are building over time an on-balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. The fourth quarter loss of $3.8 million was within the range we communicated last quarter. In the fourth quarter, Snap-on Credit grew its on-book portfolio by $137 million.", "Moving to slide 11; at 2009 year-end, our balance sheet includes gross financial services receivables of $398 million, including $267 million at Snap-on Credit. Of this amount, $227 million are extending credit loans to technicians.", "As you know, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the one-off portfolio contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $590 million at year end. We presently expect the portfolio on our books to grow by about $80 million in the first quarter and by about $300 million for all of next year. The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Port folio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to slide 12; consolidated operating cash flow was $96.7 million for the quarter and $347 million for the year. Both substantially ahead of the year-ago amounts. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we filed a notice of arbitration on January 8 regarding a dispute with CIT relating to various underpayments made during the course of the joint venture. As a result of this dispute, we withheld $81.5 million against our claim which seeks approximately $115 million.", "On January 29, CIT filed its response denying our claim and asserting certain claims against Snap-on for other matters relating to the joint venture. CIT\u2019s claim alleges damages in excess of $110 million, which does include the return of the $81.5 million retained by Snap-on as of year-end. This amount is included in other accrued liabilities on our year-end balance sheet. At this early stage, no determination can be made as to the likely outcome of this dispute. With respect to this matter, cash provided by operating activities includes only $10 million in the fourth quarter and only $20 million for the full year.", "Free cash flow from operations exclusive of our financial services was $110 million for the quarter compared to only $14 million last year.", "For the year, free cash flow from operations excluding financial services was $290 million compared to $125 million last year. Free cash flow from financial services was as expected, an outflow in the quarter of about $100 million and $191 million for the full year.", "In the quarter, capital spending of $16.1 million included investments and our plant in Minsk and continued expansion of our facilities in China. In the quarter, we also completed the headquarters and R&D facility for our automotive parts and services information business in Richfield, Ohio.", "As seen on slide 13; trade and other receivables decreased $48 million from 2008 year-end primarily due to lower sales. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables was 63 days at 2009 year-end as compared to 58 days last year. However, adjusting for currency, last year\u2019s DSO would have been 62 days.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter were down $12 million from last quarter and down $85 million for the year. On the trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns were 4.1 times, but on a trailing three-month basis improved to 4.8 times.", "Net debt at the end of the quarter was $367 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 22.2% compares to 25.2% at year end and 21.5% last quarter. If we exclude the $81.5 million of cash withheld for the CIT dispute, our year-end net debt to capital ratio would have been 25.8%.", "Cash at year end was nearly $700 million. As I already mentioned, we repaid $150 million of long-term notes in January. In addition to our cash and cash flow from operations, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility which does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At year-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.", "This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick to provide his final thoughts, I would like to mention some considerations for our 2010 outlook as covered in our press release.", "Next year, we expect to realize approximately $25 million of year-over-year savings from our 2009 restructuring activities. We also currently expect to incur approximately $18 million to $22 million of restructuring costs. We also expect next year to incur approximately $20 million of higher year-over-year pension expense. Finally, capital expenditures in 2010 are anticipated to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million and we anticipate an effective income tax rate next year of approximately 33.5%.", "With that, I will now turn the call back over to Nick. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Marty. Well, that\u2019s our take on the quarter. We are encouraged by the results, both financially and strategically. The challenges do continue but our Snap-on value creation processes are serving as well. Consider that OI percent for the year was 230 basis points higher than the last time our sales were below $2.5 billion, in 2006, not so long ago. That\u2019s evidence of real improvement.", "We also believe we progressed and achieved strategically. Our franchisee network has been kept solid in the storm. We continue to make inroads in critical industries taking the Snap-on brand and product lines to new places. We are gaining share in the key segment of repair garage infrastructure and we get stronger in emerging markets every quarter.", "I know many of our franchisees and associates are listening around the world. So I will close simply by observing that none of this progress would have been possible without your support. I congratulate you for your achievement, and I thank you for your commitment and your contribution to our team.", "Now, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question today will come from Jim Lucas, Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Good morning all.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, Jim.", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "I wanted to start first with just a couple of housekeeping questions. The vitality index percentage of sales from new products, where did that stand in 2009?", "Nick Pinchuk", "The percentage of sales from new products, we don\u2019t actually track that carefully in terms of our business. I am not a -- we track the general introduction of products but we don\u2019t track it as a percent of sales because at the end it\u2019s sort of when you get to the bottom of the order of new products, sometimes you have difficulty whether it is really a new product or just a new paint job or a new plastic covering. I will say though that we\u2019ve had a pretty robust product and I can name a litany of our products from power tools to equipment to hand tools that have come out. I think a good barometer of this is when we have the franchisee conference in the late summer, there were 60 or 70 new products just introduced at that forum. So while we don\u2019t track it we feel that it has been growing actually, our new product profile has been growing.", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, fair enough. Then just from a geographic standpoint, could you bring us up to date of you mix of North America and Europe and where the emerging market stands as a percentage of overall sales and wanted to transition from there. You alluded a little bit in your prepared remarks with regards to the progress you are making on the emerging markets side, but in addition on the new markets, I was just curious, are there any particular markets that you are doing better than others? You had mentioned on the last conference call that you had to go back and change some of the product offering to go after some of these new market opportunities and just wanted to get an update there as well.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, let me talk about emerging markets. The Asia-Pacific markets, you can tag it at about $100 million, that\u2019s roughly what we are selling in that business. This year, we have some good news and bad news out of that market. The exports out of the market have obviously been a little bit down reflecting the developed markets (inaudible) downturn. The business in China and India to name two are up very strongly, but for us that\u2019s a smaller base in terms of the total. The businesses in Southeast Asia are down reflecting the currency problems in Indonesia and the Philippines. Our European business \u2013 I think European business, you can say that our business outside the United States in total is about 40% plus, outside the US \u2013 42% I think. And that\u2019s been about steady over the last several quarters. That answer your question for geographic?", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes, that does on a geography side.", "Nick Pinchuk", "And the other piece of the question, you are talking about the individual like critical industries, is that what you wanted?", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Yes.", "Nick Pinchuk", "We continue to make some progress in, I would say natural resources, in terms of that business that seems to be selling fairly well around the world in places like Mexico and in places like \u2013 even in Europe. So we had some reasonably good wins in that area. Actually aerospace, we had some good wins in the past quarter with Gulf Stream and some other people. We saw some wins in the government. And education while down quarter to quarter because third quarter is always a big one in education, it was still pretty strong. Suffice it to say that the industrial business, which is driven by those mission-critical industries these days, is up quarter to quarter sequentially. ", "So, we were pretty encouraged by that. I think what we\u2019ve seen, Jim, is that the industrial business entered the recession late. It had a gangbusters quarter last year in the fourth quarter. The first part of the first quarter of \u201909, it was still reasonably strong and then it dropped off some, and what we are seeing is them recover. I am mildly encouraged by what I saw in the results. I also met with several hundred of the salesmen; we had them in for their annual conference. And while we\u2019ve talked about people from Louisiana in oil and gas or people from Washington selling to the government or people from the West Coast in aerospace, they seem optimistic. So we're looking for some mild optimism in that area.", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Then with regards to any commentary you can give with regards to what you are seeing on the pricing front? And more specific with regards to material prices, are you beginning to see any inflationary pressures?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No. We don\u2019t really have any significant pricing in our numbers this year. We had some good progress in terms of material cost reduction. When we look out in the future, we do see some movement, for example one of our big buy is steel; we buy about 70 million. I guess, it\u2019s not a big buy compared to some people but \u2013 and it\u2019s a mix view. Steel rod, for example, which is hand tools, went down then went up slightly in the summertime. Now it seems to be going down again. Steel plates, the equipment, which equipment uses, that's been flat and tool storage, which use coal rolls, coal rolls is creeping up. I don\u2019t worry about this too much as long as the gains aren\u2019t tremendously precipitous because we\u2019ve had a history in Snap-on because we are premium product and being able to price. So generally if material costs eke up, we can get it back in price. So I am not too worried about that being an impact for us.", "Jim Lucas -- Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Okay.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.", "Keith Schicker -- Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi, good morning. It's Keith Schicker on the line for David.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Keith, how are you?", "Keith Schicker -- Robert W. Baird & Co.", "I am doing well. Couple bigger picture earnings type questions here. I think in the past you\u2019ve always commented directionally on how you felt earnings were going to go on the next quarter. I didn\u2019t see that in the press release this morning and I was just wondering if you had anything to add about the next quarter.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think, I don't think there was any information in that omission actually. I think we feel about the same. I think our view of the future is that we feel we don\u2019t have good visibility in terms of the sales, in terms of volume. As I said in my remarks, we have some mild optimism in this mixed result. We are watching Europe very closely, it hasn\u2019t come back and that recovery had lagged. But, looking out in the future I am confident of our strategic investments and we did say in prior calls before the downturn hit that we expect to grow at mid single digits, 5% to 6% organically and I am pleased with the progress we made in the strategic areas, that is maintaining our network, penetrating critical industries which I just talked about. We are gaining share in garage infrastructure and the emerging markets. So I think as the markets rebound, whenever that is \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to happen for us just like everybody else -- I think we are going to see that mid single-digit sales growth.", "On the other hand \u2013 on the other side of this is absence that growth we still feel pretty good as we did prior quarter in the fourth quarter -- in prior calls, about our Snap-on value creation processes and their ability to bring improvement out of the same levels of volume. So as we go forward given the same volume we believe we can improve. We have opportunity to do that.", "Keith Schicker -- Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. And if I think about revenue in 2010 versus 2009, would I be right to conclude that in sort of a flat final demand situation, your sales might be up because we don\u2019t need to do any inventory correction during 2010. Is that the right way to think about that?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, arithmetically, of course, if destocking ends, say, in Europe, SNA Europe is where mostly we sell through distributors. That's our big distributor play and there are other places, but that's just in terms of volume. Arithmetically, of course. If destocking ends and end markets stay at the same level we will see an uptick. The caveat I would give you there is there can be some minor destocking at end customers where you are selling to a factory and they have a tool crib and that factory has been at half capacity for a long time and they come back and so they have a little bit. That\u2019s a minor effect, but it is an effect. And then the other effect for us is the mix among markets. We look at this carefully. We're seeing some unfreezing in Europe, in the UK, in Sweden, in Germany, but Spain is still very weak. So it\u2019s possible for those markets to be going in different directions in terms of demand and I am not sure where the balance will be. But arithmetically you are correct. If distributors stop restocking and all things remain equal and the markets remain equal, then we'll see an uptick.", "Keith Schicker -- Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And then lastly, could you just comment on I guess the pace of business that you saw through the fourth quarter and we're a month into 2010, granted it's January, but how things have gone so far in the early part of the year.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think I said it in the \u2013 I think we believe the fourth quarter was up sequentially. There was some mild optimism in there and that played out December. Some of the areas in December were fairly positive for us. I think it\u2019s best to say my crystal ball is not that good, because when I compare it to third quarter, I'm comparing to a damaged third quarter again, even though we're equal seasonality wise. Now, I will say, we were pleased with the industrial business. I just talked to the industrial guys and I must have talked to more than a hundred of them from all over the country, actually all over the world. And they all seemed optimistic. But I'm still from Missouri with regarding volume. So we'll see how it goes. I think we entered the year reasonably okay, but nothing to say, \u201cBoy, it\u2019s an indication of an upswing.\u201d", "Keith Schicker -- Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Good morning, everyone.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Hi, Gary.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Marty, I think you may have done this directionally. You gave us some guidance on where you think the financial services operating income will be in prior quarters as we exit 2010, or am I incorrect in that assessment?", "Marty Ellen", "That\u2019s correct.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Is it still where you said it was -- where you think it was going to be, I think it was somewhere $30 million to $40 million, is that right?", "Marty Ellen", "Well, I think what I said in the past was we -- looking at one or two quarters out, that first of all, in the fourth quarter we have a loss of $3 million to $5 million. We reported $3.8 million. So we are right within that range. I also had said that rolling forward another quarter into Q1, probably breakeven, we maybe $1 million or so under that number. But the trajectory from there that I\u2019ve talked about in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s actually taking the growth in the portfolio and looking at the interest yield on that, given more or less most of their expenses being fixed should give you the trajectory. So if you think about Q3 to Q4, and I would remind everybody that the earnings we had in Q3 included some gains in the first part of July, up until the termination, stripped those gains out you saw more or less about $5 million improvement sequentially. ", "And if you do the math on the portfolio growth at roughly 15% to 16% yield you pretty much get there. But you have to remember, too, going forward, Gary, that that sort of $4 million to $5 million improvement can't -- it's not linear sort of indefinitely. There is going to be at some point here an increase at a little bit of a decreasing rate. There are some longer-term contracts beyond the term of the extended credit contracts that will take a longer time to roll from their portfolio, our portfolio. But at least for the next few quarters, I would tell you maybe it will be off $1 million or so in Q1 from break-even. Expect though that trajectory that I talked about for the next few quarters to hold.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I hear you right, overall US markets are somewhat more stable than they had been for the prior couple of quarters. Certain countries in Europe are still an issue overall. But you are seeing some stability in the US, is that correct?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Correct.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Okay. Now in terms of Europe, though, you cited a couple of countries, UK, Germany, I couldn't write down the last one", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sweden.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "-- showing maybe some of the stability that the US is showing.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Right.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Okay, so then you still have issues in Spain? Do you have a big representation of European business in places like Portugal, Italy, Greece, all of these areas where there is big worries within the EU, about these countries overall?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Gary, the big issue for us is Spain. We have, ballpark, 20% of our business is in Spain -- our European business is in Spain. So we are overrepresented there I think so that\u2019s part of our difficulty.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Okay, so really it\u2019s \u2013 Spain is mainly the key issue there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, we have business in Greece, in Italy, and places like that. So you can talk about that. But your ballpark, you're talking in that range. So we have \u2013 we watch that carefully and if Spain has a problem it affects us maybe more than you might expect in other places.", "Gary Prestopino -- Barrington Research", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Next we will hear from Holly Sankar [ph] with Wolf Baker Investments [ph].", "Holly Sankar -- Wolf Baker Investments", "Hi, good morning. I have a quick question on financial services. So when I look at the guidance you have on slide 11 for 2010, you are talking about $300 million of anticipated portfolio increase, so how should I think about that then given in the past you\u2019ve grown your portfolio every quarter by somewhere between $120 million and $130 million, and it looks like it accelerated up to $132 million in the last quarter. Is this $300 million just what rolls off from CAB [ph], or how do you get to this number?", "Marty Ellen", "It\u2019s, no. But it's the net portfolio increase, so remember, as we're building our portfolio, we are not only originating new contract we are beginning to collect payments on the prior contracts we\u2019ve funded. So you are really looking at our additions if you will net of our collections. In essence what we are trying to help people with is, understanding the cash flow requirements that we need to fund over that time frame.", "Holly Sankar -- Wolf Baker Investments", "Got it. So how would that map to originations?", "Marty Ellen", "Well, we provided you with origination data for the quarter and if you historically we are in the $120 million to $130 million range globally. That\u2019s a global number, not just a Snap-on Credit number. And actually that number was up a little bit. We are actually seeing some increased penetration in the Snap-on Credit business as a result really of our end customers having fewer financing choices and therefore actually benefits our business. But more or less that number hasn\u2019t changed much, if you go back and look at their annual origination, not a lot of change, pretty flat. So that\u2019s not going to change much but we begin to collect cash from customers whose loans were originated on our books.", "Holly Sankar -- Wolf Baker Investments", "Got it. Okay. And one last question on that subject which is on the yield. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about 15% to 17% yield. Are you seeing any changes in the yields, higher or lower from credit, or that yields on treasuries?", "Marty Ellen", "No.", "Holly Sankar -- Wolf Baker Investments", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We currently have no questions in the queue. I\u2019d now turn the conference back over to Nick Pinchuk for any closing or additional remarks.", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, I don't think we have any, any closing remarks.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call, Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thank you David and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter 2010 results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's recently appointed Chief Financial Officer. Nick will lead off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions. ", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our Investor Relations portion of our website, next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today\u2019s call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk, Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Thanks Leslie. Good morning everybody. Well, we\u2019re once again encouraged with our results. We continue to make operational gains and to strengthen our strategic position. Both have helped us to deliver the results that are improving and I say are reasonable given the extended economic challenges.", "Our first quarter operating margin before financial services was 11.6%, 210 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. In fact, I think it's noteworthy that this 11.6% exceeds the first quarter record of 11.1% registered in 2008 and that was before the economic crisis. And the profits in that period were achieved at significantly higher sales levels.", "This shows our commitment to the Snap-on value creations processes is driving strong improvement. The financial results are testimony to power that effort. With our focus on Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI as you call it, we\u2019re becoming a stronger company and one that's well positioned to take advantage of any recovery. And we are seeing some positive signs, some good signs in certain market. Those opportunities added momentum to the operating progress we've been achieving over the past several quarters.", "Aldo will take you through the financial but first, I\u2019ll provide you with a perspective on the results, my own perspective. Regarding growth, our overall sales were up 8.6% from last year, over 4% organically excluding currency. As in the recent past, our results are mixed by geographies and by market segment. So I would say the quarter provides evidence that overall market have stabilized and are showing some signs of upward potential but because of the varying nature of the results, they\u2019re not yet clearly rebounding.", "In the past, I\u2019ve mentioned the trends in big ticket items, products with relatively higher sales value, tool storage unit, diagnostic products as well as under car equipment, items which have longer paybacks. We believe sales in that arena are barometer of both our customer\u2019s financial outlook and if they\u2019re confident in their future.", "Ending last year, the signs here were mixed. While in the first quarter, sales were mildly positive in all three of those big ticket categories. So we have some good news but its one quarter. Going forward, we are going to, we\u2019re striving to create a reliable positive trend in those product line. It's important to us.", "We\u2019re also all aware that Europe was particularly hard hit last year at the downturn. And here again, we saw positive signs, following on with the big ticket discussion, our sales of under-car equipment in Europe posted gain encouraging given the overall struggle of Europe and give the capital nature of those purchases. We also saw increase however in our European based hand-tool business, both sequentially and year-over-year.", "Encouraging here too was the fact that we saw some mild momentum in each month throughout the quarter. However, the mix nature of the results are also evidence in Europe. While we are encouraged by the overall gains South of Europe or existing Europe has a particularly strong position and Spain especially continuous to lag. Unemployment in that country is still very high and the drag is evident in a day-to-day commerce. ", "Another market segment that provides some gauge to the economy and one that get a real lot of national attention is the automotive OEMs and their dealers. To put this market in perspective for Snap-on, we have limited direct exposure. Our Equipment Solution Division or EQS and Snap-on business solutions SBS are where we do sell primarily OEM dealerships. ", "Those businesses combined make up only about 11% of our total sales. That being said, this is an area that has obviously suffered during the current downturn. But on the positive side, we are seeing some forward momentum with some new essential EQS tool program and we expect ongoing upside in that regard. SBS however continues to be impacted by the dealer consolidation.", "Now, both SBS and EQS have in fact achieved some progress by capturing adjacent business, serving commercial construction and agriculture market as well as supplying products to truck fleet, all which represents expended opportunity. So there are off sets to the challenge the OEM dealer shrink and as further opportunity in those adjacent spaces. ", "To summarize our view on the sales and market environment, I would say we\u2019re encouraged but cautiously. Signs are still a bit mixed. The market seemed to have stabilized but are not yet strongly rebounding, gains are being made but those increases are coming a lot comparison that were weakened by the overall downturn in 2009.", "Now such on the first quarter highlight and each of our reporting segment. In the Commercial and Industrial Group, our C&I organic sales were up over 9% from last year. We saw across the board increases in nearly all the businesses. The biggest contributors here were the equipment division including Europe as I previously mentioned and in Asia Pacific where our expended product lines are starting to take hold. ", "From a profit increase perspective, C&I was a big contributor with operating earning of over $30 million, up $13 million from last year, the OI margin of 10.2 puts reasonably rapid recovery, reflecting the hires, I think we believe, a reasonable recovery. And that reflected the higher sales as well as the benefits from RCI and past restructuring actions. ", "Aside from the financial performance in the group, progress continues to be made in areas of strategic importance. The equipment division registered wins and agreements with more vehicle OEM\u2019s as preferred suppliers. This further Snap-on presence in the garage and gives us a heightened advantage with access to quite a few additional locations. Our C&I presence in critical industries is also expanding. We introduced over 300 SKUs for a large applications and natural resource and power generation and there\u2019s more in the pipeline. We\u2019re working with customers in aerospace and government, launching special tools and kits that incorporate rigorous and innovative safety features specially designed for those mission critical applications. ", "And again in C&I, as I said earlier, we had good gains in emerging markets. It really is where the outside portions of automotive growth will take place and we continue to advance building the necessary physical and creating a broad Asian product line. Just this past month we introduced a new handheld diagnostic product in China, our first such offering for the region and our new Asian band saw our product line continue on a strong upward sales trajectory. ", "Moving to the tools group, overall sales were up 4.3% organically, 4.4% in United States. I mentioned the positive results for big ticket items, tool storage and high value diagnostics and we are working to make those gains a trend. The sales increase for the group vigilance and operating efficiency and favorable currency result in a $7.5 million increase in OI and an OI margin of 10.7%, up 220 basis points versus last year. Now, I\u2019ve spoken often in the past regarding the importance of keeping our franchise system healthy. We continue working hard toward that end and it seems to be succeeding. The network\u2019s stable, there\u2019s evidence and there\u2019s evidence of improving franchisee health.", "Terminations are at a lower level and van sales are moving in the right direction. Now, major element of support for the franchisee is the credit company. Aldo will speak about Snap-on Credit but I\u2019ll just mention that its transition to a wholly on subsidiary continues as planned and without interruptions to our customers. The credit business provides us with the strategic advantage. I\u2019m pleased the integration is going well.", "Now to the Diagnostics & Information Group or the D&I Group. I\u2019ve also, I\u2019ve already mentioned some of the challenges faced by EQS and SBS with the ties to OEM dealership. In spite of those impact however, D&I sales of a $135 million were up from last year, up slightly from last year. That\u2019s because gains were recorded in the independent shop segment with diagnostic hardware and software and our mature one information products, all showing strength throughout the period.", "D&I earnings of about $31 million were up $5.6 million. And that reflects the higher sales both in handheld units and information products as well as some solid gains and efficiencies due to Snap-on value creation. Related to the D&I market expansion or adding fleet customers in the U.S. for a heavy duty Diagnostic\u2019s products. If a target rich environment, our existing capabilities extend nicely into that area and I believe we\u2019re using that to our advantage.", "We\u2019re also leveraging D&I products and capabilities internationally. When you get outside in the United States, the dealership space hasn\u2019t experienced quite so much disruption. In the first quarter, we again saw a success in capturing new international customers for the SBS Electronics Parts catalog line and we expect that trend to continue.", "Well that\u2019s the segment round up. Regarding Snap-on\u2019s overall strategic position we\u2019ve characterized our current challenge, our challenge in the downturn as balancing cost reduction efforts limiting the impact of the downturn with the need to invest in those strategic areas which we believe will be decisive for supporting growth going forward. ", "Now I believe there is abundant evidence in our results that the impact has been limited and breakeven levels have been reduced. It\u2019s also clear to me; we\u2019re better positioned in each of our core strategic areas of strategic importance. The franchise network remains strong, terminations are at the lower levels and sales are moving favorably, regarding the primary customer basin area, the automotive technicians our position remains preeminent with Snap-on still the preferred brand across the board by a wide margin.", "We also target expanded penetration of automotive repair garage infrastructure as a strategic initiative and we\u2019ve made progress with the shop owners and the managers, the principle customers in that segment. Our repair system is from electronic parts catalogs to imaging aligners have increased their customer base both in the U.S. and internationally. And indication of that progress was a strong growth achieved by the equipment division in the first quarter. We\u2019ve also spoken often about the extraordinary opportunity for Snap-on to extend our position in mission critical industries, aerospace, power generation, natural resources to name a few. And in the quarter the industrial vision where we pursue those critical customers showed year-over-year growth against some reasonably tough comparison. They entered the recession late. Finally we continue to build our position in emerging market, growing distribution and expanding our local product line and we are seeing continued gain.", "Our sales in Asia-Pacific were up substantially in the quarter well ahead of any economic growth in the region. So we are encouraged by the first quarter. We've limited the impact of the downturn, improved our profitability and positioned our operations strategically for growth.", "Since this is Aldo's first call with us, I will provide you with the brief introduction. Aldo brings over 30 years of experience in finance and operations, corporate strategy and business development to his new role as Snap-on CFO. He joined us in 2002 from United Technologies where he held the variety of senior level positions in both finance and business development.", "In his eight years at Snap-on, he played a significant role in leading our progress. He established strong record of achievement and gained deep understanding the company's global operations and strategies. Most recently he served as President at Snap-on's worldwide equipment operations and prior to that he was Senior Vice President for Snap-on's Commercial and Industrial Group with responsibility for the group's global financial operations. In short, he brings significant financial capabilities, operating experience and strategic insight to his new position.", "With that I will turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financial details. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks Nick and good morning to everyone on the call. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the first quarter of $621 million increased 8.6% from first quarter 2009 levels. Without currency organic sales were up 4.1%. As Nick mentioned we are encouraged by these results and by some of the business trends experienced in the quarter.", "Consolidated gross profit margin of 46.3% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from last year. Savings from previous restructuring initiatives and other cost containment actions contributed about $7 million or 115 basis points in gross margin improvement. Gross margin was further aided by better sales mix particularly diagnostic and information segments which improved consolidated gross margin by another 50 basis points.", "Restructuring cost reduced 2010 gross margin by 40 basis points. Operating expenses of $216 million in the quarter while up $11.5 million from the prior year were favorable as a percent of sales by 100 basis points. Unfavorable currency translation as a result of the weaker dollar contributed about $7 million of the increase. In addition higher pension expense due to lower the projected asset returns in previous years related to the U.S. pension plan accounted for $5 million of the increase.", "First quarter 2010 results were also impacted by higher volume related expenses as well as by $3.5 million of higher mark-to-market incentive in other compensation. These year-over-year increases and operating expenses were partially offset by about $6 million in benefits from ongoing RCI restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment actions. Restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $3.2 million as compared to $2 million last year. The significant portion of this quarter\u2019s restructuring costs again occurred in the commercial and industrial or C&I segment.", "Financial services incurred a $1.7 million operating loss in the quarter as previously disclosed Snap-on ended the joint venture with CIT in July 2009. The $1.7 million loss compares favorably with a $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the $5.3 million loss recorded in third quarter 2009. Consistent with our issuance of $550 million of fixed rate long term notes in 2009, interest expense increased $5.4 million year-over-year.", "The proceeds from these notes are being used for general corporate purposes including the January 12 repayments of $150 million of floating rate debt the part of maturity as well as funding the growth to the Snap-on credit on balance sheet portfolio. Effective income tax rate in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2010 was 34.5%. As Nick mentioned, operating earnings was $71.7 million before financial services, improved 32% over prior year on an 8.6% sales increase.", "Finally, net earnings of $36.8 million or $0.63 per diluted share increased from $34.8 million or $0.60 per share last year, despite the $8.6 million or $0.15 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings associated with financial services.", "With that I will now turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7, segment sales of $297 million improved 14.5% from prior year levels. Excluding $12 million of favorable currency translation, organic sales increased nearly $26 million or 9.4%. This year-over-year in increase was driven by a mid-teens increase in sales of equipment worldwide; particularly higher sales of alignment machines in the Americas and Europe.", "Sales increases were also realized in our European-based tools business. We still faced headwinds in this region but these higher first quarter sales may be evident of some early stabilization of the European markets. The year-over-year sales increase in the C&I also reflects, continued higher sales in emerging growth markets and increased sales of tools, kits and tool storage products to industrial customers.", "Gross profit in this C&I segment of $105 million increased to $13 million from $92 million last year. This increase reflects contributions from higher sales, $4.3 million of savings from restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment actions and $2.3 million of favorable currency advice. Operating expenses in the quarter of $74 million were essentially flat year-over-year; savings from restructuring and other cost reduction and cost containment initiatives of 3.2 million as well as some lower bad debt expense were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $3.5 million along with higher sales of volume related expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved 350 basis points year-over-year from 6.7% to 10.2%.", "Now turning to slide 8, on a worldwide basis, year-over-year sales in the Snap-on tools group increased 8.9% or 4.3% excluding currency. Land count in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter was stable compared to first quarter of 2009 and year-end 2009 levels. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.4% from the prior year. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group $113 million increased $10.7 million over prior year representing a 60 basis point improvement in gross margin. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and favorable currency effects, partially offset by inventory related another expenses. Operating expenses of $85 million in the quarter increased $3.2 million from prior year levels, primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and higher volume related expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 10.7% in the quarter for the Snap-on tools group improved 220 basis points from 8.5% last year.", "Turning to the Diagnostics and Information or D&I group on slide 9, first quarter 2010 sales of $135 million were up 2% from prior year levels, mostly due to currency. Excluding currency organic sales were essentially flat with prior year levels, as higher sales of diagnostics and information products, and increased facilitation program sales were partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales, the OEM dealerships which are continued to be impacted by the challenges in the automotive industry.", "Gross profit margin of 51.4% in the quarter for D&I Group improved 320 basis points over 48.2% a year ago benefiting from an improved sales mix of higher margin diagnostics and software products. Savings from prior restructuring actions and $1.2 million of favorable currency effects also contributed to the $5.5 million year-over-year increase in gross profit. Operating expenses for the group were relatively flat with 2009 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of D&I Group improved 380 basis points from 19% last year to 22.8% this year. Contributions from the improved sales mix and $3 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by $1.3 million of higher restructuring cost.", "Turning now to slide 10, the year-over-year comparisons for financial services reflect the termination in 2009 of the Snap-on credit joint venture with CIT. As you know since July 16 of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT in reporting the gain on sales. Rather we are building overtime and on balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As the on-balance sheet portfolio grows, so will our financial services earnings.", "The first quarter loss of $1.7 million for financial services was improved from the $3.8 million loss reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. Moving to slide 11, as in the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $365 million in gross financing receivables from our Snap-on U.S. credit operations and $129 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing receivables portfolio of $494 million. Within the U.S. Snap-on credit portfolio, $313 million relates to extended credit loans to technicians. As you know, Snap-on credit continues to manage the run off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT which totals $483 million at first quarter end. Snap-on credit\u2019s on book portfolio grew by about $98 million in the first quarter of 2010. ", "For the full year 2010, we presently expect that the on book portfolio will grow by and therefore require net cash of approximately $300 million. The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations. Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.4 million. At the end of the quarter, our cash position of $472 million was down from approximately $700 million at 2009 year end. This decrease primarily reflects the $150 million debt repayment in January and the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on credit. ", "In the quarter, capital spending of $5.7 million was down from $14.1 million spent last year. The higher level of capital expenditures in 2009 including spending to support the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in Minsk, Belarus and the further expansion of our plant in Foshan, China. Capital spending last year also included the construction of the new R&D facility and headquarters for our automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. As seen on slide 13, trade and other receivables increased to $8.4 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher sales. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 63 days was flat with 2009 year end.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $16.3 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to seasonal inventory build and increasing production levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns were 4.2 times, slightly up from year end. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $444 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 25.9% compares to 22.2% in 2009 year end. If we exclude approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the first quarter would have been 30.3%.", "In addition to our quarter-end cash of $472 million, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility which does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available. In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Before turning the call back to Nick, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we continue to expect to incur restructuring cost of approximately $18 million to $22 million. At the same time, we believe we will continue to realize further benefits in 2010 from our RCI sourcing annual cost reduction initiatives. We also anticipate continuing with our planned strategic investment including expansion in emerging markets.", "We continue to anticipate capital expenditures in 2010 that will be in the range of $55 to 60 million. We also will continue to incur $5 million per quarter of expected higher year-over-year pension expense. For full year 2010, we now anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 34.5% which is slightly higher than the 33.5% estimate communicated at year end, primarily due to a higher mix of U.S. earnings.", "Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, that\u2019s our prospective on the first quarter. Our commitment to the Snap-On value creation process to safety, quality, customer connections, innovations in RCI, it continues to pay off. OI was up 32% in the OI margin of 11.6% was strong compared with history on considerably lower sale. ", "The markets have stabilized and appear to be favorably inclined although its way too early to call a clear trend. And our continued investments in the strategic customer segment, the franchisees and their technicians, the repair, the garage owners and managers, the mission critical industry and the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are all reaping benefit. ", "The bottom-line is that because of our commitment to Snap-On value creation processes and because of our strengthening strategic position, we are confident that Snap-On is well poised to take full advantage of the recovery as it occurs.", "Now, I will end with a word to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening to this call. The results of the quarter were encouraging. But I know that they were only made possible by your capability, by your effort and by your commitment to our team. You have my congratulation and you have my thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "First question with regards to currency was hoping you could just help us out with translation versus transaction. With gross profit referring to currency being favorable yet operating expenses currency being unfavorable and with the continued fluctuation in the dollar if you could give us a little bit color what are you seeing there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I can start out and may be Aldo can roll in. I think what we saw in the quarter year-over-year was positives with the Canadian dollar where we sell, we also buy some out of Canadian plans but we are positively exposed there and around the pound. And those two currencies tended to be quite favorable for us and that generated the positive events here. Going forward, we see the same events around Canada but the pound has started to weaken some we could see some headwind in that situation. ", "If you thinking about currency in terms of translation, our translation numbers in the first quarter on sales would have been about $24 million and operating expenses would be something $6 million to $7 million on a negative basis.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Yes. That\u2019s helpful and then starting first on the CNI side some very good color about the ongoing investments, very helpful commentary surrounding what you are seeing on the equipment and the big ticket side. Could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of re-stocking versus overall demand whether by geography or end market?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think we are seeing any restocking, stocking is through. I think people are snake bitten over the past recession. So we are not seeing any evidence in the United States where we sell through another level whether you are talking about our dealers, our franchisees or you are talking about distributors outside the United States. We are not seeing evidence of restocking. So none of that we believe is in our number. A quite a few of our businesses, for example, the industrial business is direct. So restocking would be a factor in that situation. The big question for us has always been Europe about re-stocking and de-stocking and we certainly haven\u2019t seen any restocking in Europe. The de-stocking seems to have ended in certain parts particularly in terms of the North. The South continues to be sliding. Spain, the markets in Spain and if you look at the GDP in Spain it's still going South. ", "So what we see is no restocking, an ending of de-stocking in the North of Europe, some minor I guess continuing weakness in the South. We just haven\u2019t seen the markets snapped back to the point that we expect people to restock. I\u2019m not sure when that will happen Jim. When we talk to distributors or I talk to franchisees, they all have their, to use an American expression, their Missouri head on, they\u2019re in show me territory. So they\u2019re going to have to see quite a bit of time go by before they\u2019re going to enter restocking.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and switching gear to the tools group. You referred to the termination is down, plans in terms of adding to the franchise count this year also, where the van count stands currently and then secondarily from a mix standpoint, could you give us anymore color of what you\u2019re seeing on hand tools versus power tools versus storage boxes?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes. Van counts are pretty stable. It\u2019s give or take 3,460 in the United States as about where it was at the end of December. Terminations are at an all-time low but you could say we\u2019re not capturing any. We\u2019re not increasing on that because we\u2019re not gaining even though the termination is at an all-time low. I would add quickly though we\u2019re being very selective of our people at the van because we had difficult experiences when we put people in vans that might have been not appropriate or not as I guess born to do that kind of business, and so we had some difficulty when they ended up having, not being successful. So we\u2019ve been stable there. Our plans are still to expand that business and we are still continuing to working to refine our recruiting models to make sure we can move forward and build that van count.", "In terms of mix, our hand tools were up slightly in the quarter. Remember that hand tools never really went down very much. It was all tool storage and big ticket items. So, the mix of tool storage and diagnostic, you can pretty much say that the increases for year-over-year are rooted in tool storage and high value diagnostic units. Power tools was down slightly but that has to do more or less with the timing of model introductions.", "Operator", "We have David Leiker with Robert. W. Baird.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "It's Keith Schicker on the line for David. I just wanted to start sequentially with the tool segment. It looks like revenue was up about $30 million sequentially; Q1 versus Q4 and operating profits split a little bit. Could you provide any color on that variance there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes. Well, first of all, we had record. I believe probably an all time record OI margin in the fourth quarter for the tools group so was gain busters. So we knew we had top comparisons if you are going to go sequentially. We had our volume rise up. So we got some pop out of volume and a little bit of absorption. Much of that business was as I said before big ticket items which tend to be ironically a little lower in absorptions because there are components purchased more than a hand tool. A hand tool tends to be a big labor, big machine, high fixed cost equipment. ", "Diagnostic tend to be component purchased and assembled. So we could get a volume push but the absorption might not be as much as you might expect if you are modeling this. We had favorable LIFO in the fourth quarter which I think we called out in our release which basically accrues to the tools group. In first quarter in a tools group, you do have a launch; we have kick off around the country. So there is a little more expense there and I think I would say that if we wanted to get jump started into the year with those big ticket items because we thought that would lead the way. So we promoted them relatively aggressively. So when you put all that together that ended up blunting some of the drop through you might expect off the volume increase.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "", "Perfect. Yes, that's great. If we look at the commercial and industrial segment and this is a difficult question but the margin improvement there, would you attribute more of that to getting more volume running through the model or would you attribute more of the margin improvement to some of the cross section that you have taken in that part of the business?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think it's both situation. The commercial and industrial division has been throughout the years pretty much our poster child to rapid continuous improvement and we did get nice drop through on some of the volume. But you don't get that kind of popping, I think we went from 6.7% OI margin to 10.2%. I think the numbers are something like that. You don't get that just from volume. So there was good drop through because we had some nice sales and alignment and so which are high profitability product, high margin product but we also had some great RCI benefits. So I\u2019d say both were big factors. ", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "But wouldn't think alone one or the other.", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, I would not. They got a nice increase in volume right.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay ", "Nick Pinchuk", "That's a good thing but the drop there was very high. So you can make the calculation based on that.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay and then two more quick ones here. Has there been any issues that you've had with the closure of the aerospace in Europe from a business perspective?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Yes. A couple of our guys are trapped in Paris for days and they are running out of clothes.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "We haven\u2019t had too much. I have made this kind of a joke about it. But there are people trapped there. We had some training plan, that\u2019s that put on hold. So that\u2019s an issue. I don\u2019t see us having a problem. If you look forward, we could have a problem if we ran out of things that we needed to airship. Europe would be a less of a problem then if this extended to Asia let say. To put it in perspective though we spent $90 million a year in freight, $5 million of this is air. So it\u2019s not a huge problem for us. It could create some irritancy in certain product lines and certain places. But we don\u2019t see it being an issue right now.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay and then the last one. It's still relatively early here in the second quarter but if you could just comment on some of the end market trends that you\u2019ve seen really early in the quarter here?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Couple of things, one is that we don\u2019t see much seasonality in our business except for the third quarter. Our third quarter tends to drop pretty much because of Europe, because of our dependence on Europe and some of the markets in United States people take the van drivers to take vacations in the third quarter from time-to-time. So, we do see weak third quarter but by and large not much seasonality going from first to second. So there is not much of a tailwind in that regard. ", "Looking out for the future, I think I stand on what I said in my remarks. We think the markets are leaning positively but it was one quarter and in those numbers are some expansion to new adjacent segments like capturing customers in Europe for the EPC and reaching out to new OEMs and equipment sold. There is probably some market shares in our gain, in our growth number and that 4% growth number as well. So I\u2019ve learned in the recession not to make any future calls. All I can say is the market seems to be leaning positively but I am still from Missouri that is show me. I\u2019m looking forward for any kind of recovery. The one thing I can say is, wherever it happens we\u2019re poised to take advantage of it.", "Keith Schicker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay and do you think this market share gains are something that can continue or would you rule that out or how should we think about that?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "I said market share. It\u2019s always dangerous to talk about market share gains over quarter. These are simply new customers that we captured. I believe we can capture new customers though. That\u2019s what our strategic initial is all about, that\u2019s what penetrating the garage, a repair garage owners and managers is about. That\u2019s what is extending the mission critical industry is about, that\u2019s what building in emerging market is about. It is after all share gain and so we believe very strongly that we\u2019ve taken the action in building capabilities in product lines and physical distribution to be able to take advantage in those areas which are pretty much adjacent for us as the recovery occurs.", "Operator", "We\u2019ve Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Seems to me just a little bit more optimism, can you express here but relative to the past conference calls I have been on Nick. But I just went through my notes. I just want to make sure you basically said that some of the big ticket items particularly in Europe you were seeing so mildly positive sales gains in tool storage diagnostics under-car is that correct?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes. What I said was I am seeing increases in tool storage and high value diagnostics that more refers to the United States than Europe, equipment I meant both developed markets United States and Europe.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Are these sequential or year-over-year? ", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "They are year-over-year and for tool storage and diagnostics they are sequential. Equipment had a gain busters quarter, in the fourth quarter so I say it\u2019s about flat.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "You also mentioned that some of the more Southern European countries you are dealing with are Italy possibly Greece Marseille having issues?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Spain.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Spain. But the Northern European countries are starting to at least stabilize.", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "We are looking better in the North UK, Sweden; France is looking a little better for us. Spain, the reason I mentioned Spain, Gary is that SNA Europe has a significant portion of its business in Spain. It\u2019s the leading market player in Spain and so for us Greece is kind of interesting. We sell there but it\u2019s not such a big factor. Italy, some factor for us but Spain is a significant challenge for us and we see the Spanish market continuing downward.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Could you just remind us what your percentage of sales are to Europe and U.S. and then what would you categorize emerging? Do you have that handy?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Of the top of my head 42% outside United States, I would say is 26%, 27% in Europe. You might say Asia-Pacific 8-10%.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "And in Asia-Pacific which is probably more your emerging markets?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "", "What did you see there is particularly?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Booming. We saw great smaller base though. When I am quoting the numbers Asia-Pacific, I am talking about Japan which is a much more stable market. But when I talk about the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific, I am talking about China, India, the ASEAN, all where we\u2019ve been building our physical presence and expanding our product lines where we add the diagnostics in China, where we provided the ASEAN (inaudible) those business in the emerging markets of Asia were up substantially well ahead of any GDP growth in those areas. So the GDP growth is pretty robust. Now again Gary it's off a smaller base but we are pretty encouraged by that.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Okay and then last question, we are truly coming out of this worldwide recession.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I didn't say that.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "", "What? No I am saying that. My prediction. How is the performance bid of your business line different now or coming out of this relative to where it has performed in the past recessions coming out of that? Is there any big differences that always been choppy by country or is there something that you can point to that significantly different that is giving you cause to be cautious here?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "No. Actually nothing that's giving us cause to be cautious out of that. If you are asking me how I feel about this, there is a couple of things, one is I feel why we brought down our breakeven?", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Right.", "Nick Pinchuk", "That's good. Secondly, okay, the recession put everybody on stall a little bit. We\u2019ve had chance to build our strength in places. So we kept investing. So I think we are in better shape perhaps then maybe some others are because we kept investing. We didn\u2019t take capacity out in Europe, we kept in place. Remember, we talked about that in the prior calls. We kept, because we were confident that the markets are going to come back. So I believe and we have building in Asia-Pacific well maybe this there was a tough time for some others. So building our product line for critical industries. We kept expanding our product lines throughout the recession. So I feel pretty good about the positioning. The only difference for us I\u2019d say is that Spain, one of our markets, one of our more major markets in Europe is unusually weak. That\u2019s about the only difference about our business versus I guess any other kind.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time, and I will turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional comments or closing statements.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A replay will be available shortly on our website and as always we thank you for your interest in Snap-on.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks Holly and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter 2010 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will lead off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on the Investor Relations portion of our website, next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "As noted in today's earnings release and as previously communicated, we recently realigned our management organization in an effort to better support the products and service needs of our primary customer segment. As a result of this realignment our reportable business segment now include the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group, Snap-on Tools Group, Repair Systems & Information or RS&I and Financial Services.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk, Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Leslie. Good morning everyone. I think it's fair to say that the second quarter results provide some significant evidence that our strategies are working. We continue to make tangible gains in markets that are mixed, still tough, but improving.", "In this environment we remain committed to the Snap-on value creation process. They form a powerful framework for both capturing those opportunities and for achieving cost and flexibility improvement and we continued to make progress in the four and key strategic initiatives that we believe would be decisive for us going forward; enhancing the franchise network, expanding our presence in vehicle repair facilities, extending out of the garage and into critical industries, and building and emerging markets.", "In each of those areas we are encouraged by the progress that's evident in our second quarter. The organic sales in the quarter were up nearly 10%, about $57 million from last year and operating earnings before financial services were up more than $25 million or 47% over last year's level. The resulting operating margin was 12.2%, that's up 310 basis points from 2009.", "Encouraging progress was the Snap-on value creation processes, processes like safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement have driven to reality. As usual, Aldo will take you through the financials in detail but first I will give you our perspective on the markets and cover some of the operating highlights.", "Last quarter, I characterized the markets as, I think I said stabilized, favorably inclined but not rebounding. Since then, we haven't seen any exceptional economic acceleration. However, I will say that overall nothing has led us to be less positive.", "So certainly, we now have one more quarter of stability and we actually see some pockets are further strengthening. So we are a bit more encouraged, but we remain cautious. It's clear that the recovery is fragile.", "Let me provide you a little bit more color on the sales front. In addition to the 9.6% of year-over-year organic sales increase, volume was also up about 6% sequentially from the first quarter. For us overall, there is not much seasonality except in the third quarter when summer vacations and shutdowns primarily in Europe can make volume hard to predict.", "So the 6% sequential increase in the second quarter was fairly strong compared to what normally is relatively flat for a second quarter progression. In fact, it was the strongest second quarter uptick we've seen in at least seven years. This strength was reasonably widespread with all the operating group, Commercial and Industrial tools and RS&I were up all stronger than the normal increase.", "In addition to those overall volumes, we've also been watching the trends and what we've been calling big ticket items, large dollar products like diagnostics and under-car equipment that have longer payback, and tool storage units, which are more discretionary purchases.", "Given the capital nature, we believe activities in those products are a window on our customer's financial position and the overall confidence and we are encouraged by what we saw.", "Under-car equipment sales showed favorable trends in the quarter and that was true in both North America and Europe. Diagnostics and Tool storage units, which are generally sold through the van channel also showed positive sign. So, now we recorded two quarters of big ticket progress and that is a fairly strong positive because we seen quite a bit variation in these products during the downturn over the last 18 months.", "If we dissect the sales by geography, we see an uneven landscape. In Europe sales are up from last year about in line with what see for the overall company increase. Remember however, though that Europe was hard hit, very hard hit last year. So I think we need to see a bit stronger gain in order to start feeling clearly positive about that situation.", "Within Europe the regional variances of the last quarter continued modest recovery in the north and central areas, weakness in the south. Spain in particular where we have fairly large position is not recovering. I think everybody is aware that Spain been among the hardest hit in the downturn, and we seen this reflected in our Spanish business. A couple of bright spots though, I'll say even better elsewhere have been under-car in Europe, under-car equipment in Europe and a even bit more rapid recovery in the East and places like Russia and Turkey, all of those were up strongly.", "Also in U.K., we are seeing some strength, especially in the Tools group where actually we are coming of a fairly solid 2009. That is the comparisons aren't that easy. So the gains in the U.K. are significant, a real positive. So, I'd say then that Europe is mixed. We are seeing some positive signs, but we are still some distance from a clear trend.", "Asia, no surprise it's outpacing the rest of the world. We are seeing solid increases there, both in emerging markets like India and even in the more established markets like Korea, building our presence in the region with both physicals and product is paying off.", "So, with another quarter of favorability behind us we are optimistic. However, we also still believe the recovery is gradual. It seems everyday we see and we hear mixed signals and for us, for our customers it does impact their confidence. I said frequently last year that people were eating bad news for breakfast, everybody from the paper and from the TV and I think we still have a bit of the same thing going on now only with mixed signals.", "So, the uncertainty remains but we would say we are moving in a positive direction. So, we will stay focused on the approach that's been successful for us; vigilance on cost, flexibility and reaching for opportunities, Snap-on value creation driving improvement, and investment in the size of initiatives for growth.", "Now for some highlights on each of the operating groups, Commercial and Industrial or C&I. Sales were up 22% from last year with double digit increases in all of the units. The operating margin was 9.9% also up substantially. Volume and ongoing operational improvement did the trick in that area.", "The industrial division especially in the US showed the strongest gain, making advances in critical industries, taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage like we said before. For example, our position in the Aerospace segment, it continues to strengthen. We are partnering with OEM aircraft manufacturers as well as Tech schools to develop and support Snap-on specific aviation certification programs. It's a great way to establish an early relationship with students who are future technicians. For us, it's an effective path in creating a lifelong professional customer and we continue to move forward with that type of partnership approach in a number of industries like wind, oil and gas, and in fact auto repair.", "Let's go back to the Aerospace segment. This is an area where Snap-on is uniquely positioned. The mission critical nature of the work is obvious. The quality of the Snap-on brand is required and valued and the potential for growth is abundant for us.", "While the industry has been depressed, there are some signs of recovery. At the Farmborough International Air Show, there has been a lot of confidence in aircraft orders were surprisingly strong. Snap-on's at that show displaying a revolutionary tool control innovations and they've been a big hit. So we like our position as the aerospace sector recovers.", "We are also reaching new critical industries and tailoring our lineup to support that effort. I spoke to you last quarter of the broadened product line we've been introducing for large tool application in areas and segments like mining and natural resources. In the second quarter, we saw more progress with those customers due to that expanded offering and a significant industrial sales growth is evidence of that success.", "We talk about innovation often at Snap-on. Our leadership in innovation and design, our focus on safety is also evident with the BAHCO brand. Last year, the BAHCO Handsaw System won the prestigious Red Dot award for European design excellence and this year the recognition continued with the product being named the winner of the Design IF award for ergonomics.", "That system provides ergonomically superior handles, in different sizes for left and handed users with 10 different interchangeable blades for cutting a variety of materials and it offers a patented locking system. Innovation driven by customer connection is helping SNA Europe sell even in the downturn, helping BAHCO maintain a world class brand.", "Asia-Pacific, as I said is continuing its upward trend. Sales were again up strongly with gains in India, China, Philippines and Korea leading the way. We've been working hard over several years in that region to establish our physical capability, more salesmen, more factory capability and capacity, more Asianized product and its being paying off. You can see it in our numbers. You can see it in the success of our new products.", "A great example is the new BAHCO Asianized bandsaw, a runaway seller. So much so, that we outstripped our recently established capacity and we are acting right now to double down on Kenosha's saw capacity. So Asia is a success.", "Moving to the Tools group, volumes increased to 7.8% in the quarter, about $19 million from last year. With the US posting a 9% gain, operating income was up $7.5 million to $33 million or 12.5% of sales. For sometime, one of our key initiatives has been to strengthen the franchisee network. I think we have clear evidence that those efforts continue to pay off.", "In the second quarter, our sales in the US returned to 2008 pre-recession level. Now I think it's widely agreed that the overall economy hasn't returned to same levels two years ago. So reaching that benchmark is encouraging for us.", "I spoken in the past about our franchisee stimulus program, aimed at supporting the network. It's been a key to our sales return and we believe that right now our franchisees are in better shape, sales strong, profits robust, cash improved. So the stimulus is working and the network is stronger.", "I already mentioned big ticket items and the favorable results. Those are the products that are often require finance and in that space Snap-on credit is a huge advantage. It's core contributor to the power of our franchise network. The credit company's transition into a wholly owned subsidiary of Snap-on started about a year ago and it's progressing well.", "In the second quarter it's now turned profitable as we said it would in several prior calls. At the end of the day though, in our business, you have to have great products to sell and we use our frequent touches with the end customer to create just that.", "Innovation and new products are born out of technology advantages, or often born out of technology advances, but some times it's less complicated. It comes from just knowing your customers' problems.", "For example, in using the 3600 franchisees and talking and visiting with customers, with automotive technicians, we found that all-in-one wire stripper, crimper and cutter pliers were designed primarily for electricians. They tend to spend more time stripping wires and you can imagine, they don't have the same space challenges as an autotech. So with that insight our engineers went to work and developed a new compact cutter and stripper tool, designed specifically for tight auto applications,", "It has been huge hit, not a big ticket breakthrough product that transforms a company but thousands were sold and it's great example of using customer connection to our advantage, extending Snap-on's traditional innovation. That tradition echoes favorably up and down the product line and in and out of garages all over this country and all over the world.", "Now, to Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group. This was the group that was formed out of our recent reorganization, lining each new segment up with a primary customer base. The Tools group focused on auto technicians. C&I focused on professionals in critical industries and emerging markets, and RS&I, serving vehicle repair shop owners and managers. We've now organized a capture growth in each of these broad and important customer segments.", "Back to RS&I. Overall volumes increased 4.7% driven by the equipment division activity, driven by the equipment division's increases that I'd mentioned before. It also had some solid improvements at EQS, our facilitation and essential tools business. Those gains in those areas helped to offset Snap-on business solutions or SBS where activity continues to be down, related to consolidation in the overall OEM dealer space.", "Now, SBS is working to help itself. It's working to create some offsets of it's own by expanding with existing customers including internationally and with [batches] that haven't been impacted by the dealership disruption. They are also working hard to grow near adjacent market such as power sports, agricultural and construction.", "Speaking of OEMs and the dealers, we are seeing some improvement in that area and the OEM manufacturers' willingness to commit to essential tools and the dealers themselves are starting to make purchases. So all of this certainly drove some of RS&I's improvement and the RS&I group is growing elsewhere.", "We saw some solid sales increases related to our expansion in the heavy truck and fleet market. To think about it, that's a natural fit for us and we've been making investments in product both diagnostics and repair information and we are starting to get traction.", "So that summarizes the market and I think it provides you some perspective on our advances in the quarter. So now I'll turn from an operating perspective. So now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financial results in detail. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Sales in the second quarter of $648 million increased 9.8% from second quarter 2009 levels. The primary drivers behind are the $8 million year-over-year sales increase, include tire sales in critical industries, increased sales in emerging markets, higher equipment sales and increased sales by franchisees in the US and U.K.", "The company also saw many improvement in its European based businesses. Consolidated gross profit of $303.8 million in the quarter increased $49.8 million year-over-year, while the gross margin improved by 380 basis points.", "These increases were largely due to the higher sales volumes and favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of the increasing levels of production. Savings from rapid continuous, RCI initiatives and benefits from previous restructuring actions contributed about $7 million of gross profit improvement.", "Foreign currency primarily transaction FX, contributed $5 million and lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed an additional $3 million of gross profit improvement. As a result of these factors consolidated gross margin improved to 46.9% in the quarter as compared to 43.1% last year.", "Operating expenses in the quarter increased to $25 million from 2009 level. This was primarily due to higher volume related expenses and $14.9 million of increased performance based incentive compensation expense as a result of improved year-over-year operating performance and increased participation in the company's stock purchase programs.", "In addition, we incurred $3.1 million of higher pension expense, largely due to lower than projected asset return in previous years, related to the US Pension Plan. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by $2.5 million of benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2.5 million of lower restructuring cost.", "As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 34.7% in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to 34% last year. Restructuring cost in the second quarter totaled $3.1 million as compared to $8.6 million last year.", "Operating earnings of $79 million before financial services improved 47% over prior year and 9.8% sales increase. Financial services' operating earnings of $1.7 million in the quarter improved sequentially from a $1.7 million loss of the first quarter of 2010 and also compares favorably with a $3.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.3 million loss in the third quarter of 2009.", "As previously discussed and as expected operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense is consistently improving as the on-book finance portfolio grows. Since the termination of the financial services joint venture with CIT in July of last year, our gross on-book finance portfolio has grown over $450 million to $577 million. Year-to-date this portfolio has grown about a $180 million.", "Turning to interest expense, higher average debt levels primarily related to the growth in our on-book finance portfolio, increased interest expense by $1.6 million year-over-year.", "The second quarter effective income tax rates for 31.2% in 2010 and 31.9% in 2009. The improved and lower than previously communicated effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2010 primarily benefitted from the favorable settlement of a tax audit. The second quarter 2009 rates benefitted primarily from the realization of a tax benefit in a foreign jurisdiction.", "Finally, net earnings of $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share increased from $37.4 million or $0.65 per share last year, despite $11 million or $0.19 per share of lower year-over-year net earnings from financial services.", "Lets now turn to our segment results, beginning with the C&I group on slide 7, segment sales of $259 million improved 22% from prior year levels. The year-over-year sales increased was driven by a higher sales across all operating units with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.", "Again this quarter, sales increases were realized in our European base tools businesses. While we still face headwinds in this region, we are encouraged that the higher year-over-year sales in the first half of the year may be evidence of some continuing stabilization in the European markets, despite the headlines of late, regarding financial market volatility in that region.", "Gross profit in the C&I segments of $93 million increased $27 million or $41.6%, from 2009 levels, reflecting the 22% sales increase and $5.2 million of savings from RCI, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.", "The year-over-gross profit comparison also benefitted from favorable manufacturing utilization, as a result in increasing production levels. You may recall that last year we incurred substantial cost to carry excess manufacturing capacity primarily in Europe, as a result of lower production levels and inventory reduction efforts.", "For the current quarter, gross margin of 35.8%, improved 500 basis points from 30.8% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $67 million were up slightly year-over-year as higher volume related and other expenses were partially offset [Author ID1: at Fri Jul 23 21:45:00 2010", "]by $1.4 million of more restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment improved from 1.1% in the second quarter of last year to 9.9% this year.", "Turning now to slide 8; on a worldwide basis, second quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group increased 9% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.8% including a 9.3% increase in the United States. Man-count in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter increased slightly compared to prior year levels. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group of $116 million increased $14.4 million over the prior year.", "This increase primarily reflects contributions from higher sales and benefits from favorable manufacturing utilization as a result of increasing US production levels and $4.9 million of favorable currency effects.", "In the quarter, gross margin improved to 43.7%, an increase of 200 basis points over 41.7% last year. Operating expenses of $83 million in the quarter increased $6.9 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.5% in the quarter for the Snap-on tools group improved 200 basis points from 10.5% last year.", "Let's now turn slide 9, and the segment we now refer to as Repair Systems and Information or RS&I. As previously communicated the RS&I segment and its operations are aligned and focused on better serving customers in the worldwide vehicle service and repair marketplace, including all orders of managers of independent and OEM dealership service and repair shops. In addition to equipment products and equipment repair services, the RS&I segment included the business operations of the former Diagnostic and Information group.", "Second quarter sales of $206 million in the RS&I segment were up 4% from prior year levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales of equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program sales, partially offset by anticipated lower electronic parts catalogues sales in North America, the latter a result of OEM dealership consolidations.", "Gross profit of $96 million in the quarter increased $8.2 million from 2009 level, primarily due to contributions from the higher sales $1.6 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.1 million of lower restructuring cost. Gross margin in the quarter improved to 46.5%, an increase of 230 basis points over 44.2% last year.", "Operating expenses of $56 million were up 1.1 million from 2009 level, improved 50 basis point as a percent of sales. Higher compensation, volume related and product development expenses were partially offset by $1.7 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives, as well as $1 million of lower bad debt expense.", "Operating earnings of $40 million in the RS&I group for the quarter increased $7.1 million or 21.6% on a $7.9 million or 4% sales increase. The favorable incremental operating margin is primarily due to $3.3 million of savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and $1.8 million of lower year-over-year restructuring cost. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the RS&I group of 19.4% improved 280 basis points from 16.6% last year.", "Turning to slide ten. The $1.7 million of Financial Services earnings in the second quarter compares favorably to a loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 and loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Financial Services earnings in the second quarter of 2009 prior to the determination of the joint venture with CIT were $16.6 million. As you know since July 16 of last year we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sales. Rather we are building overtime an on-balance sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows so will our Financial Services operating earnings.", "Moving to slide eleven. As of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $451 million in gross financing receivables from our US Snap-on Credit operations and $126 million in gross financing receivables from our international finance subsidiaries for a total financing portfolio of $577 million.", "In the United States, $384 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the termination of the joint venture, Snap-on Credit continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $384 million at quarter end, which is down approximately $100 million from first quarter end.", "For the full year 2010, we continue to expect that the on-booked financing portfolio will grow by approximately $300 million. This suggests that additional growth in the Snap-on Credit US portfolio of about a $110 to $120 million over the remaining six months of this year.", "The net cash requirements of our international finance portfolios are substantially self funding. Portfolio loss and delinquency trends continue to be in line with our expectations, and have improved sequentially compared to Q1.", "Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $55.5 million. At the end of the quarter our cash position of $431 million was down from approximately $472 million at first quarter end. This is driven by the net increase in finance receivables of $73 million primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit.", "In the quarter capital spending of $6.6 million was down from $19.5 since last year, primarily due to last year's construction of a new R&D facility and headquarters for our automotive parts and service information business in Richfield, Ohio. For the full year 2010, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million.", "As seen on slide 13, trade and other receivables, increased $6.9 million from 2009 year end, excluding $18.6 million of currency translation impacts, trade and other receivables increased to $11.7 million, primarily due to higher sales. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 59 days, improved from 63 days at 2009 year end.", "Inventories at the end of the quarter increased $21.8 million from 2009 year-end. Excluding $14.4 million of currency translation impacts, inventories increased $36.2 million primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns increased to 4.4 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year-end.", "Net debt at the end of the quarter was $493 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.3% compares to 22.2% in 2009 year-end. If we exclude approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the second quarter would have been 32.5%.", "In addition to $431 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility that does not expire until August 2012. We also have another $20 million of committed bank lines. At quarter-end, the full $520 million of borrowing capacity was available.", "In addition to these facilities, our current A2/P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter-end, no commercial paper was outstanding. Our liquidity position and access to credit continues to remain strong.", "This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance, but before turning the call back to Nick, I'd like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we presently expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost, somewhat less than the previously communicated $18 million to $22 million. This reflects the more likely calendarization of program actions to improve the company's fixed cost structure.", "We also anticipate continuing our planned strategic investments, including expansion in emerging markets and as I mentioned earlier, for the full year 2010 we presently expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $50 million.", "With respect to pension, our current expectation is that 2010 full year pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year. This is down from the previously communicated estimate of $20 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions.", "Finally, as a result of the favorable settlement of certain tax audit in the quarter, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 is now expected to approximate 33.7%.", "Before opening the call for questions, Nick will like provide some final thoughts. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Thanks, Aldo. So, wrap up. We are encouraged by the quarter's results, the second straight upward movement and perhaps the beginning of another trend. Sales up almost 10%; profits up 47% versus last year; good sequential progression versus the first quarter. The OI margin at 12. 2% is fairly robust. Our Snap-on value creation process just keep generating gains. In the quarter we saw all the elements of that play book work; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and RCI, and you can see it in the numbers.", "We've said consistently that throughout the downturn we would keep investing in the key areas, which we believed will be decisive in capturing growth going forward and we said as a result we would take advantage of the recovery as it occurs. The second quarter is testimony to the success of that approach,", "The van network is robust and back to 2008 levels. Share is growing is the garage. Our presence in critical industries is expanding and we are building a significant position in emerging markets.", "So looking forward we are optimistic, although cautiously so. We see the world leaning favorably in North America, mixed but positive in Europe and clearly growing in Asia. To be sure, the recovery is fragile and we are going into the third quarter, which is always difficult to predict because of the vacation period, but now we have two positive periods, so we are optimistic.", "We are not certain what the immediate macroeconomics will hold but we believe in the special strength of our markets. Making work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks is valued in any situation and with Snap-on value creation and our strategic investments we continue to believe that we are very well positioned, well positioned to take advantage of any recovery, in whatever shape, over what ever timetable it occurs.", "I want to finish just by recognizing our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are on the call. The successes in the quarter were only possible because of your efforts, your capability and your commitment. You have my congratulations and you have my thanks.", "Now we will open the call to questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird", "If I think I heard you correctly you made a comment that your US tool business is back at pre-recession levels, is that correct?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Correct.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird", "I know you got a lot of different business, but is there any way you can give some us some characterization of any other pieces of your business that might be back there close to getting back to those levels?", "Nick Pinchuk", "The industrial business is starting to get back towards that level. Industrial business had a pretty strong quarter, and showing some pretty good growth, and so we are starting to approach back to 2008, however we weren't really satisfied with the 2008 levels, we thought we had a lot of opportunity beyond that, so that's the business.", "The equipment business, even though we have been showing some upward growth in it, upward trends in the equipment business, we are still somewhat below the 2008 levels and of course Europe is quiet a bit below still. The European, the SNA Europe businesses are quiet a bit below that level.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. Then, as you look across your businesses, where do you think, what are the biggest laggards, where is the weakest parts of your business right now and it sounds like most likelihood it would be auto Europe at the moment?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I might not use the word laggard but see the business that's the furthest behind in 2008, is of course our SNA Europe business. They took quite a beating over last year. They were down substantially and they are coming back. We believed in the future of that business and we still believe, we believe we were maintaining or gaining shares, we said through the years but the volume is just still quite a bit below 2008. So I'd say that has to be the place which is the weakest position.", "The other play, I did mention RS&I before, there are some elements of RS&I, the new Repair Systems and Information group, Mitchell1 and Diagnostics are at 2008 levels, but SBS is down because of the consolidation of the dealers, the OEM dealers in the United States and that business is working feverishly to find offsets in adjacent markets as I said in my remarks. So if I were going to take two places which are behind, I would say Snap-on business solutions in the OEM dealership business and SNA Europe.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird", "", "SNA Europe is predominantly driven by Spain, right?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, the North is strong and Spain and Portugal was down. I think even the North is still below 2008 levels though, David. We are definitely seeing signs of recovery in the North but Spain and Portugal are pretty flattish. If you took Spain and Portugal out of the numbers, you'd see some pretty strong growth year-over-year but we have to remember that it's off a pretty weak base there.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird", "Then just one last item here. With the reorganization and kind of realigning the business model here, what has been the reaction from your workforce and your franchisees, distributors? What kind of response have you gotten from those folks?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think the franchisees, there's no reaction, and it pretty much didn't change their situation very much. I just pretty much said, we are focused on technicians. We have favorable responses from our customers particularly around the RS&I because in grouping equipment with that and now we've got a number of operations, which are truly focused on that particular customer vehicle shop owners and managers.", "It's a terrific customer base for us and the fact that we declared that you are a specific customer for us and we don't want to provide you products, we want to provide, we want to solve your problems. That has been received very well.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "First question, Nick, in your prepared remarks you were talking about seeing some pockets of recovery as well as improvement on the big ticket side, which obviously is encouraging, but could you give us a little bit of more color, maybe put some numbers behind what you are seeing first on the big ticket side, but when you refer to those pockets of recovery, is any particular geography or end market standing out more than others?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think the US is a great, the US dealer, the van channel, the mobile van channel is I think a shinning example of, maybe pocket is a little bit of a dismissive way to look at that, but the mobile van channel is a good place to talk about that. That business, like I said is up to 2008 levels and people talk about the restocking.", "We haven't seen any restocking there at all. So, in fact we like the cash position of our vans in that business. So I think we are very encouraged by the 9% to 10% growth in that channel itself.", "Now, the equipment, the big ticket items in there, it's kind of bifurcated. The smaller big ticket items, that is diagnostics and tool storage are starting to get back to 2008 levels, which we like. This is was we said all along and if you look at, I think we had the best quarters since 2008 in that business this quarter.", "If you look at the equipment, the other piece of the big ticket items, we are encouraged because that was in North America but we are still below 2008 levels, in low double-digits. Europe, though in equipments was a big strength for us. Europe has gotten back close to 2008 levels in the big ticket items and that was driven, I didn't talk about this in my remarks but by an extraordinary new product, which we launched in Europe the Prism aligner, this is an aligner, which allows you to package alignment into a smaller base, and as you probably can figure that the base, the garages in Europe are somewhat more compact, so the value of that aligner breaking on that market has given us some pretty good tractions., So we feel pretty good about that situations.", "So, I think those are couple of places, the other place in the industrial group, the businesses in critical industries like natural resources and aerospace are up in some pretty, I don't want to give you any numbers in this because we don't give numbers out, but they are up very strong and much, much higher than our average. We feel pretty good about that and as you know industrial is not a restocking situation. That's a direct sales model so restocking doesn't have much to do with that.", "Now we do have in our industrial business a smaller group, a smaller piece of the business, which we sell through distributors. You may remember this in United States it's a very small piece of the business and there could be restocking there, but that business was up over 50% in the quarter. So, we feel pretty robust about that situation, the whole idea of recognizing that when we roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage, the customers are open to that idea, they are open to that idea. So it seems to be working.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "All right that is very helpful. Can you spent a minute on the Tools group because that clearly is a shinning example here, a good turn but if we go back over the last decade, the revenue for that business has fairly consistently been between a $1 billion and a $1.1 billion.", "So we are seeing it back to the '08 levels as you said, but as you look at that business going forward, how do you get consistent growth out of that Tools group?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Certainly, its one of our strategic challenges that we said always but we believe that we have runways for growth in that group, one is the fact that we know that they are a number of customers who buy Snap-on tools for their workplace and then at home they use another brand, lets say a mid-tier brand, so we can sell Blue-Point.", "We launched the mid-tier brand to sell to them also, as much as we work to make customers for life, with educational institutions and we sell Snap-on brand to them. Some new technicians simply don't think they can afford Snap-on, they buy an alternate brand. So they can afford Snap-on, we sell a Blue-Point to them. So there is opportunity to grow in that mid-tier here.", "Secondly we go on about 800,000 technicians. In the United States there are 1.3 million. Fully enabled our vans call on about a 850,000 technicians. There are 1.3 million. The reason why we don't call on those others, 400,000 to 500,000 is because they are lower volume and our technicians drive by them because they don't want to spend time with them and that is a productivity issue, none of the technicians are vans driven, but that's a productivity issue.", "So productivity on the van will allow us to take our existing framework, our existing network and reach out to a big portion of that 1.3 million. Now it's not a one for one replacement but it's a real opportunity for us. That's why we are launching rapid continuous improvement in the vans. That's what we are doing this year. It's one of our big initiatives and I see those two things as ways to grow.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay, that's helpful. Then finally, hopefully we are back to getting to some sense of normalcy despite the fragile nature of the recovery, which I think we all agree on. Could you just bring us up to-date with the realignment here as we look at the three segments? I don't want to pigeonhole into actual targets but conceptually, how do we think about the margin potential for these three segments longer term?", "Nick Pinchuk", "The thing is we've said that overall we would expect the target to grow in normal environment, not recessionary environment, not recovery environment, because that's all better off in that kind of situation.", "In a recovery, we would expect to grow faster than normal, but we'd say we'd grow 4%, 5%, 6% per year on an organic basis and then we'd expect our operating margins on an overall basis to be mid-teens and the way that lays out with the new segments is that the RS&I, I believe is at 18, 19 now, it would be over the 20 mark some place, and the Tools group and the Commercial and Industrial would start to approach the mid-teens, be slightly below the average. So that's where we see it. We feel pretty confident we can do that.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. Final question, just in terms of longer term capital allocation strategies, the Financial Services is kind of playing out as expected. Could you just bring us up to-date about how you think about an acquisition strategy longer term?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Our view is that we are always available. We are not a serial acquirer, but we could see ourselves acquiring properties that seem to make sense in our orb.", "Lots of people used to think about Snap-on and I think we thought about this as ourselves as a company that makes wrenches, sells through vans to auto mechanics and we now think of ourselves as something broader that is, a company that provides, makes work easier, productivity solutions for serious professionals, who are performing critical tasks in critical industries like aerospace and oil and gas.", "That's a much wider space, and any acquisition, an acquisition that would give us further presence in that broader space with customers we would be interested in doing.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "So that's where we would invest our cash because we believe that concept is a valuable concept and we believe with Snap-on value creation we can drive profitability through that and the Snap-on brand on top of it gives us legitimacy in that space. So that would be cash well spent.", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) Next we'll hear from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "", "Nick, in your comments you mentioned that the big ticket items, you were encouraged by what trends were there. Could you possibly, I don't know if you want to put a number on it but Q2 is significantly better than Q1 or just really seeing a stabilization and no more deterioration?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, Q2 is better than Q1. In all of those categories, I think just let me, the stage is to be clear is that for diagnostics and tool storage, primarily sold through the van channel, Q2 was the best quarter we have seen since Q2 2008.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "That was the best quarter in 2008. So we had a gangbuster this quarter in terms of big ticket items and actually if you remember we said this is exactly how we understood the business. We said that people who were in garages, they were buying wrenches and they kept buying wrenches through the downturn and that was it. It was big ticket that was off, because people thought that they charged, the uncertainty, the idea of not wanting to invest in those big ticket item took them away.", "Well, we are back to 2008, and lo and behold the vehicle of restoration has been the rise in the big ticket items. That's exactly what we been I think thinking about and trying to conjure in these calls for a long time and so that's really what happened. So we did have a good quarter in the first quarter, it was a good quarter, but this quarter was up double digits.", "Then in terms of equipment we are still not as I said we are still not back to 2008, we are still coming off the floor and that makes sense. So Gary as you think about it, diagnostics is the best. So the most expensive its like an [$8000] purchase, tool storage can be $5,000 to $10,000 but when you are talking about some of that equipment that under-car equipment it can be up $20,000, and it's much more of a capital type equipment.", "So therefore the whole idea of the uncertainty around the recession becomes more dampening in that area and that's what we are seeing.", "So we are seeing progress, but it just isn't as fast and it hasn't snapped back to before 2008 levels. In fact it went deeper than diagnostics and tool storage. The one thing I did say though was that, what we are really pleased with is the effect of that new Prism product in Europe, which really gave us some boost in equipment.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "Then do you feel that, you mentioned and also in your prepared comments a lot of the gross margin improvement was due to higher sales volume. I mean if the sales volumes kind of stay the same in terms of the growth here, do you feel like you will be able to maintain that gross margin somewhere in the high 46% in the back half of the year?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yeah, I think that is right, I think you know, we obviously, like any company you can have a mix issue and if we have higher sales in Asia and so on, if we higher sales in Asia and so on, we can, that's is a little less profitable and the drop through is somewhat, but we still are pretty good about maintaining the number, that gross margin number, I mean we had some absorption in this period and we had some cost savings but still I feel pretty good about maintaining the gross margin.", "So you got to kind of remember though is that, I think everybody should remember is, you have a couple of good quarters, we are going into the third quarter. I think that the third quarter for us is highly unpredictable, more difficult to predict because we have European vacations, the franchisees tend to relax a little bit, they go to the Merlin show or something like that, whatever they do.", "Historically our third quarter has had more variance than other quarters. So we think of our year as 1, 2, 3 and 4 in terms of trying to model it out. I think the third quarter; it's hard to make a lot of judgments on.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will take a follow-up from David Leiker.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "", "Just a couple of other items here to follow-up. You called up a couple of things here that were, higher costs here year-over-year, and the current expense you mentioned particular about $16 million. What is that number running year-to-date, do you think?", "Aldo Pagliari", "This is Aldo, David. It's about $20 million, I would say as an absolute number. Also I want to call attention to it, it did include higher, particularly higher year-over-year expenses related to greater participation to the various company stock purchase programs, which also allows franchisees to invest in the company stock as well.", "So we saw some higher year-over-year participation and with the growth of the stock price, it fueled a higher year-over-year cost per share for those who participated as well.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay. So, 4 in Q1, 16 in Q2, what should we kind of look out for that number here, sequentially going forward in the back end of the year, do you think?", "Aldo Pagliari", "In Q4, it will be approximately $5 million, 4 to 5.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Then Q3?", "Aldo Pagliari", "It will be similar. Similar amount, maybe a little bit less.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay. So we really did have a pump up here that's beyond what normal is?", "Nick Pinchuk", "We did.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay, great. Then, yes, I know this is the tough thing. We've talked about this before, but in the industrial market is there any way you can give us some sense of what your penetration, is there market share and\u2026?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don't know. I can't. I think I can only tell you that we are growing faster than anybody else is saying, pretty much. We're growing pretty fast and that's been for some time. It is very difficult to do that and that's bad news I think from a modeling point of view and I suppose from an investment point of view, but its good news from an operating point of view because what it means is that market is unbounded in terms of customers and in terms of products.", "One of the reasons why its so difficult to say what the market share is, because how do you calculate it, because we go into a customer like a military, a tank command and we say, what you need and we're not sure. Sometimes we provide them things we never thought was part of our orb, because we put it in a kit.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Right.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Like a flash light or some thing or generators and things like that. We sell it, we provide it in package with Snap-on tool. So that's an example of us struggling, we try to identify that. Equally, we find customers that are added, I would say three years ago I wouldn't have said wind would have been a customer for us and now there is some customer there.", "So it's very difficult to define that. I can just say that, it seems to us based on the growth, we were getting good growth if you remember all the way through the first quarter of 2009 in this business.", "We were expanding and we took a downtick, growth faster than anybody else was talking about and we should because we are rolling a Snap-on brand out of the garage, it was a new thing. We are providing something new, capturer, share takers. Now this quarter it has started back up again. So, I believe we are taking share, I can't define it though, sorry.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "So, as you go into these customers and these markets, I mean obviously they are getting the product from somewhere right now. Do you have sense of who you are displacing in those products or they are just new market opportunities that didn't exist?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, it depends on the location, I mean in Europe we are displacing people like\u2026As I said if you are talking about tool competitors, you are talking about displacing people like in Europe, let's say you stop [Willie] or a [Good Door].", "In the United States the usual suspects that come out of our major competitors would be those who would be displaced and also some specialist people who are small. There are people in United States who only make pliers or screwdrivers and so on. We would displace them and then also we wouldn't displace people, we would be sort of like the distributor for some other people that might have been selling direct before but the customers feels pretty good about a packaging with our tools. So all those phenomena is occurring.", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "Okay. Then if we look at China, the economy is hot there, the government there is trying to slow things down, we're definitely seeing on the automotive side of thing and I know your business is more industrial there, but are you seeing that slow down and what your thoughts about going forward?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I was just there. I have been back from China less than only a week. I was just there with our salesmen and meeting with some customers and we don't see a slow down now. Having said that though, Asia is 5% to 10%, of our business, and we are just bulking up there, we are adding factories and products and so on. So I would charge out, I in fact I do charge our people to grow regardless of whether the economy moves from 12% growth, to 7% growth, because we are just taking share in general. So we wouldn't necessarily see it so easily but having said that, I didn't see any evidence of slow down, to tell you the truth. Now I read the papers like everybody else and the government saying slowdown, but I didn't see it.", "", "David Leiker - Robert. W. Baird", "I am with you on that, and then lastly here Aldo as you look at the Financial Services business, where do you think you are on track now to rebuild that asset bases that's kind of the second quarter 2011, as you get back there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think I will take a little [mirror] targets though, David, as an end stage. If you look at the former portfolio that we had with CIT as partner was about $800 million range. We anticipate that our future statement that would be about $750 million because we are probably going to do little bit less badly seeing that things of that nature that might be better suited for Banks than do directly with franchisees.", "It will take a little bit of time for some of the tail of the old CIT portfolio when it comes across. So I have been saying as I meet with people, that I think we will see our future staying at about like a $750 million US portfolio in and around somewhere around 2012. Ramps somewhere in that time frame, but you know our future state that we envisioned for this, is tending to follow the model, we have a portfolio that is yielding at expected rates, we are fortunate in that the bad debt performance and delinquencies are still on plan and on target and actually have slightly improved. We are very pleased with that.", "The originations which underlie the volume tend to track more or less with the Tools group. I think it the reflects the actions in the Tools group. That's what it's there for. So pretty much as the Tools group volume rose, we expect that this renewal of contracts and add-ons as we call them will continue to prosper.", "So at the endgame, we expect that this has the capability even after interest expense is allocated to create a portfolio that will generate about a 25% return on financial income and that financial income would be, the portfolio yield times the overall finance receivables, that are there within it.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Well everyone, thanks again for joining us today and for your interest in Snap-on. A replay of this call is going to be available shortly this afternoon and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks. Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Leslie Kratcoski, please go ahead.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks Evelyn and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter 2010 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will lead off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on the Investor Relations portion of our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk, Nick.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks Leslie. Good morning everyone. Well, Snap-on had another quarter of improved year-over-year performance and on top of that we saw some favorable market signal, so it\u2019s very encouraging. We believe there is now clear evidence of a building Snap-on strength in the recovering market. Overall, our organic sales were up 13.4%, solid by any measure, and that\u2019s after being up 9.5% in the second quarter and 4% in the first quarter. Needless to say, we like that trend.", "Operating income rose 72% from last year with financial services contributing profitability as projected improving its performance as it brings the loan portfolio on to Snap-on\u2019s books. The operating company ally without financial services increased by a strong 46%, so again overall we are encouraged by the strength of the quarter, and that result was in the face of an unfavorable swing in LIFO.", "We would say our runways for growth are clearing and our Snap-on value creation processes around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they continue to drive progress. So, having said that let me give you a bit of color, and my perspective on the trends we see.", "With respect to the economic environment and the impacts on our market, there are some nice positives. It was our third straight quarter of increasing year-over-year gain. So that alone indicates a better environment, and there is also a building momentum in some of our more strategically important areas in our core auto repair business, in emerging markets, in critical industries, all areas where we see clear long-term runway.", "Now, the third quarter is seasonally are most challenging. It can be quite variable. So, it\u2019s some times difficult to draw extended conclusions from the results, but having said that Snap-on\u2019s quarter was robust completely overcoming the typical season low.", "We often talk about big ticket items, higher-price products that either have longer paybacks like diagnostics or under-car equipment, or a more discretionary like tool storage units. Activity here is usually a barometer of our customers\u2019 overall financial health and of their confidence. ", "You recall that during the downturn last year we saw quite a bit of variation from period to period in big ticket purchases, but with these results we\u2019ve now put together three quarters in a row of year-over-year increases in all three big ticket categories. They are all back now to pre-downturn levels.", "In the tools group, both diagnostics and tool storage units showed significant gains. A real help in this was our new diagnostics handheld unit called them VERDICT. It was launched at our annual franchisee conference in August and it got great reviews. It\u2019s a fully functional unit that we believe set a new industry standard with features like detachable wireless touch screen display, remote use from anywhere in the garage, Wi-Fi internet capability and access for Snap-on\u2019s unique repair information and database.", "The VERDICT is clearly an innovation. It provides real productivity to technicians and as you would expect the reception has been very strong. Beyond the vans, our equipment division, part of the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group showed strong year-over-year gains in particular and its big ticket under-car products that\u2019s what equipment sales. It achieved gains in both North America and Europe well ahead of our company\u2019s overall sales increase. In fact equivalent lines were even slightly ahead of the second quarter, and third quarter sequential increases is very rare for this business, because a large presence in Europe and the associated seasonality usually make July through September a tough period. So, this quarter\u2019s increase, sequentially increase in equipment sales was a big win.", "From a geographical standpoint, there hasn\u2019t been much change in the regional market landscape. North America showed gains that were a bit better than those recorded worldwide. Europe\u2019s recovery is generally a little weaker, we were however up double-digits, though the story there continues to vary region-by-region.", "In the south, especially Spain there still hadn\u2019t been much improved. Spain is important for us because that\u2019s in our European big hand tools business has an exceptionally strong presence. On the other hand, the North is decidedly more positive. Sales in markets like Germany, Sweden and Finland all grew strongly, so Europe is still mixed, but for us up double-digits overall.", "With the respect of emerging markets, the places where we\u2019ve made investments and are focused on expansion like Eastern Europe we saw a strong growth in Russia again in the quarter up nearly 50% and Asia-Pacific continued its steep growth curve significantly higher than our overall increase with India and China both setting the pace.", "China continues to sell out all the bandsaw\u2019s it can produce and the Indian sales team is now gaining real traction in the under-car equipment market. So that\u2019s some perspective on the global environment, a varied landscape, but increasing almost everywhere.", "Now for some highlights on the operating segment. Commercial and Industrial or C&I saw volumes up about $45 million that\u2019s more than a 21% increase, operating earnings rose $21 million with those increased volumes and strong RCI results driving in the improvement. RCI results in the quarter are dramatic testimony to the ongoing power of our Snap-on value creation processes.", "They\u2019ve contributed greatly to our progress so far and we are confident there is still much more opportunity to go. We\u2019ve often spoke about the runway in critical industries where the tasks absolutely need to be accomplished without sales. Well, recently we had graphic evidence of such a situation, many watched the dramatic rescue of the miners in Chile as it was broadcast around the globe, it was a great story and you could clearly see SNA Europe\u2019s BAHCO branded tools on the scene assisting in the rescue, accomplishing the critical mission on the quarter.", "So, our performance, but while that\u2019s an interesting sidebar. I think I would like to talk about our performance in the industrial business. One of the real positives for the company this past quarter, near record sales trailing only the fourth quarter of 2008 in volumes, a really strong quarter.", "Our industrial business was up 34% and that gain was across the globe and that was without much restocking. We believe that is evidence of our success in moving the Snap-on brand out of the vehicle garage and into critical industries everywhere. Look it\u2019s clear, that overall economic activity is not at pre-crisis levels, but we still achieved a near record quarter in this space, it shows we are making significant gain in the strategic area.", "I have also mentioned in the past, that we are expanding our product offering aimed specifically at critical industries, like power generation, mining and aerospace, it's paying off. Along those lines innovations play the big part of Snap-on history and that tradition continues today.", "Just this past quarter, we launched our new Automated Tool Control or ATC tool storage product aims squarely at the aerospace sector. We\u2019ve taken our sophisticated digital imaging technology, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in car aligners and transform tool storage boxes into hi-tech assets, compared with the keyless entry system that laser technology scans the tool door, it knows who checked out and who returned every tool, every time.", "It's important to know where your tools are when you are working on jet engines, ATC accomplishes that task like no other product and it\u2019s a great system and we\u2019ve started to see our first sales in the quarter. The ATC technology is only one example of leveraging Snap-on\u2019s breadths and depths to drive the company\u2019s presence in critical industry. We are collaborating widely across business operations to maximize opportunities by applying our existing advantages in one sector to develop opportunities in others.", "For critical industries, such as power generation and aerospace, military, and mining and many other we are well positioned to modify our core product and technologies to meet the unique requirement, the third quarter is more evidenced that it's working. ", "A good portion of our effort in emerging markets gets reflected in C&I, so I will talk about that now, I touched on the strong increases earlier and that growth only comes with expanded physicals presence in products, and we are aggressively building both in those market.", "In Asia we are increasing manufacturing capabilities, both in Zhejiang and in Xiaoshan were our Wanda acquisition is based and we recently launched our Asian Handheld Diagnostics Unit, it\u2019s our first specifically tailored for the region and there is more in the pipeline. In Eastern Europe, last year we build a plant in Belarus, just this past month we have the official inauguration that included government dignitaries and broad TV coverage.", "It was great exposure for the innovated technologies we\u2019re bringing to the region, and it\u2019s just a type of presences and reorganization that helps in building a distribution network, creating a foothold and in generating the strong sales increase we\u2019ve seen in this quarter in Eastern Europe, that\u2019s C&I.", "Let\u2019s move to the tools group, we\u2019ve seen a return to pre-downturn sales levels, overall volumes up nearly 11% in the US better at nearly 13%. OI margin is same as last year after adjusting for a $4 million negative LIFO swing. These results reflect our balanced approached to maintain the strength of our powerful franchise system. We\u2019ve invested significantly in training and product support to keep our network robust.", "In that way in August we held our annual Snap-on franchisees conference. It\u2019s annual, but this one was special, it served as the highlight of our 90th Anniversary celebration, we\u2019ve been in business for nine decade and it was a significant success, record attendances, more product, more trading seminaries, and a business and profit center aimed specifically at helping our franchisee to improve their business efficiencies. That was really popular.", "The mood of the conference was very positive, I can tell you. The franchisees are up beat about their prospects. They enthusiastically embrace Snap-on\u2019s cohered focus on making work easier for professionals who perform critical task and because they know our whole organization is behind that mission across the globe in all of our division. They believe strongly in their future with our company.", "We\u2019ve spoken in the past about the Snap-on stimulus program. Well the best stimulus we can provide is great product. So, we\u2019re encouraged that we were recently recognized for just that. Snap-on was named the overall best brand in six tool categories of tools by Frost & Sullivan\u2019s in the 2010 survey of technician. ", "Snap-on carried the number one ranking by wide margins, for example in hand tools 70% of the technicians preferred the Snap-on brand. The nearest competitor had an 8% share, and diagnostics in winning margin was 46 to 9 and the numbers for tool storage was 63% Snap-on the highest other brand 8%.", "Our products were also recognized in the quarter by professional tool and equipment news, the Snap-on low profile ratchets in the Quadriga tire changers were both recognized by that publication for outstanding innovations in vehicle repair. Now this awarded special, because it was based on the opinion of professional users, the people that gained productivity by actually using Snap-on. So, that says a lot. ", "I already mentioned the recovery in big ticket items. Many of those sales are through our vans, on credit and that credit has been available without disruptions throughout the inauguration of Snap-on Credit. Our financial service business is performing as we predicted, becoming increasingly profitable as the loan portfolio moves on to our books and that successful inauguration of Snap- on Credit has had a significant hand in supporting the sales and growth.", "Now for some discussion of the RS&I group; sales up about 10% or $19 million excluding currency, OI up 11.2%. I already mentioned the equipment division\u2019s big ticket sales gains in both North America and Europe. The strong increases of equipment are a big part of our RS&I progress. You remember that RS&I portfolio is where we have our exposure to the North American OEMs and their contraction of the dealerships. ", "So, Snap-on business solutions does continue to be impacted by that disruption. We did, however, in the quarter, achieved more offsets with an increasing activity and OEM essential tools and diagnostics programs. We\u2019re also gaining a heavy duty diagnostics products, supplying trucks, supplying to truck shop owners in a greater volumes than ever before.", "And you\u2019ll probably remember that RS&I focuses on vehicle shop repair owners and managers, we\u2019re expanding in that space and you can see it in this group\u2019s numbers. Our Diagnostics and Mitchell1 divisions already strong in the independent repair shop continue to better the positions. In addition, for the successful new VERDICT handheld I mentioned earlier, Mitchell1 released a new version of a shop management software with significant success. We\u2019ve made investments in this area and it\u2019s paying off.", "Well, that gives you a little color on the quarter. Significant sales increases, encouraging profitability, strengthening strategic position and ample runways for further growth.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo for the financial review.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating result is summarized on the slide 6. Net sales for the third quarter of $653 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, sales increased 13.4%. As Nick mentioned, the primary drivers behind the $71 million year-over-year sales increase include significantly higher sales to customers in critical industries in emerging markets, as well as double-digit increases in worldwide equipment and sales to franchisees in the United States.", "Consolidated gross profit of $301 million increased $40.7 year-over-year driven by higher sales, improved manufacturing utilization and savings from ongoing rapid continues improvement or RCI initiatives and restructuring actions. Foreign currency benefited gross profit by $2.7 million while lower year-over-year restructuring cost contributed another $2 million.", "The overall benefits from improved manufacturing utilization, RCI currency and lower restructuring were partially offset by $4.1 million of higher year-over-year LIFO-related inventory expense. As a result of these factors, consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points a 46.1% as compared to 44.8% last year.", "Operating expenses in the quarter increased $15.9 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at our 2010 Annual Franchisee Conference.", "Year-over-year operating expenses also included $4.1 million of higher U.S. pension expense largely due to lower the projected asset returns in previous years. These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense, favorable currency translation and savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives.", "As a percent of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved to 150 basis points from 35.5% last year. Operating earnings of $78.8 million before financial services improved $24.8 million, which is a 45.9% year-over-year increase on 12.3% of higher sales.", "Including financial services, operating earnings increased $35.1 million or 72.1% over 2009 levels. As a percentage of total revenues, operating earnings increased 420 basis points from 8.3% last year to 12.5% this year. Financial services operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter improved $10.3 million for the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million. On a sequential basis, financial services operating earnings improved $3.3 million from second quarter 2010 levels.", "As expected operating income from financial services, which is before interest expense continues to improve as the on-book finance portfolio grows. The third quarter effective income tax rates were 34.4% in 2010 and 29.3% last year. The lower rate in 2009 reflects the favorable resolution of certain tax matters as well as the favorable mix of foreign earnings.", "Finally, third quarter net earnings of $46.5 million increased $21.1 million or 83% from the $25.4 million earned last year. Let\u2019s now turn to our segment results. Beginning with the Commercial and Industrial or C&I group on slide 7, segment sales of $261 million improved 19.5% from prior year levels. Excluding the impact of currency translation organic sales increased 21.2%. The year-over-year sales increase was again driven by higher sales across all operating units with particularly strong increases in those businesses serving customers in critical industries and emerging markets.", "Gross profit in the C&I segment of $96.2 million increased $25.9 million or 36.8% from 2009 levels. This increase is primarily due to higher sales and $3.5 million of savings from on going RCI and restructuring initiatives. The gross profit comparison also benefited from improved manufacturing utilization, primarily in Europe, as a result of increasing production levels.", "For the quarter, gross margin of 36.8% improved 460 basis points from 32.2% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $65.6 million increased $4.8 million from 2009 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses, and increased restructuring cost. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved by 280 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin in the C&I segment of 11.7% in the third quarter of 2010 improved 740 basis points from 4.3% last year.", "Turning now to slide 8, on a worldwide basis, third quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $259 million increased 10.8% from 2009 levels, including a 12.8% increase in United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on tools group of a $108 million in the quarter increased $3.4 million from 2009 levels primarily due to higher sales in favorable currency effects.", "The year-over-year gross profit comparison was also impacted by higher costs associated with increased franchisee product related programs and by $4.1 million of higher LIFO-related expense. LIFO-related expense was $600,000 in the third quarter of 2010. Last year, as a result of lower production in inventory reduction efforts, the LIFO-related benefit was $3.5 million. As a percentage of sales, gross margin in the quarter was 41.6% as compared to 44.7% last year.", "Third quarter operating expenses of $79.5 million in the Snap-on tools group increased $4.7 million from 2009. This is primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses as a result of increased participation at this year\u2019s annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which focused primarily on the development and profitability of the franchise network.", "In the quarter, we also incurred higher cost associated with the development of a new and expanded product catalog that was deferred from 2009 to 2010. We view these increased cost as longer-term investments in our business. As a percentage of sales, operating expense from the quarter improve to 140 basis points, from 32.1% last year to 30.7% this year. Third quarter operating income for the Snap-on tools segment was $28.2 million or 10.9%of sales compared to $29.5 million or 12.6% of sales last year.", "After adjusting for LIFO on both years, operating income in the quarter increased $2.8 million or 10.8% year-over-year and as a percentage of sales was 11.1% in both years. ", "Turning to slide 9; in the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I segment. Third quarter sales of $207 million were up 8.1% from 2009 levels. Excluding currency, organic sales were up 10.1%, primarily due to higher worldwide sales of equipment, increased essential tools and facilitation program sales, and higher diagnostic sales and Mitchell1 information products. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated lower electronic parts catalog sales in North America, as a result of OEM dealership consolidations.", "Gross profit of $97.3 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million or 13.3% from 2009 levels. Primarily due to higher sales, low restructuring cost, material cost reductions and continued savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. Gross margin in the quarter of 46.9% improve 210 basis points over 44.8% last year. ", "Operating expenses of $55.6 million in the quarter were essentially flat with 2009 levels as higher volume related product development and other expenses were largely offset by lower restructuring cost, favorable currency translation, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives as well as lower bad debt expense.", "As a percentage of sales operating expenses improve 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $41.7 million in the quarter increased $11.2 million or 37%. As a percentage of sales operating margins in the RS&I group improve 420 basis points from 15.9% last year to 20.1% this year. ", "Turning now to slide 10, financial services, operating earnings of $5 million in the quarter, compares favorably to both second quarter 2010 earnings of $1.7 million and to the third quarter 2009 loss of $5.3 million.", "The $10.3 million year-over-year increase and operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from Snap-on Credits growing on-book finance portfolio. As you know, since July of last year, we are no longer selling loan contracts to CIT and recording gains on sale, rather we are building an on-balance-sheet interest yielding portfolio. As this portfolio grows, so well our financial services operating earnings.", "Moving to slide 11, as of third quarter ends, our balance sheet includes gross financing receivables of $528 million from our US Snap-on Credit operation and $139 million from our international finance subsidiaries, for a total financing portfolio of $667 million.", "In the United States $445 million of the portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Snap-on continues to manage the run-off portfolio of contracts owned by CIT, which totaled $317 million at third quarter end, down $67 million from second quarter levels.", "For the full year, we continue to expect that the on-book financing portfolio and Snap-on Credit will have grown by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year end US finance portfolio of about $565 million to $570 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses in delinquency trends, these continue to be inline with our expectations and they have improved compared to both Q1 and Q2 levels.", "Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $10.2 million. At the end of the third quarter our cash position of $360 million declined $71 million from second quarter 2010 levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit.", "Since second quarter end, net financing and contract receivables increased $85 million. In the quarter capital spending of $10.5 million was down from 2009 levels, primarily due to last year\u2019s construction of a new R&D facility in Richfield, Ohio and the accelerated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets.", "As seen on slide 13, since last year end trade and other receivables increased $20.6 million and days-sales outstanding improved to 62 days. Inventories increased $50 million from 2009 year end, primarily due to higher production levels as a result of increased customer demand. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns improve to 4.5 turns as compared to 4.1 turns in 2009 year end.", "Net debt at the end of the quarter was $571 million. Our net debt to capital ratio of 29.2% compares to 22.2% at 2009 year end. Excluding approximately $108 million of cash, currently withheld related to the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our net debt to capital ratio as of the end of the third quarter would have been 32.9%.", "In addition, to $360 million of cash, we continue to maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility and $20 million of committed bank lines. Most recently on October 1, we entered into a loan and servicing agreement that allows us to secure additional borrowings up to $100 million through the pledging of Snap-on Credit finance receivables under an asset back securitization facility.", "This agreement provides us with additional available credit capacity and funding diversification that supplement to our existing credit agreements. As of third quarter end no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance.", "Before turning the call back to Nick, I\u2019d like to review our outlook for the balance of 2010. For the full year, we expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring cost and approximately $45 million for capital expenditures. We continued to expect that full year 2010 pension expense will be $16 million higher than last year.", "Finally, the anticipated effective income tax rate for full year 2010 will approximate 33.6%. Before opening the call for questions, Nick would like to provide some final thoughts. Nick.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Look, I\u2019ll close by saying again that our performance in the quarter was quite encouraged. We believe that represent strong confirmation that Snap-on is a company with unique strengths, ongoing opportunities for improvement and extended runways for growth. ", "Going into the downturn, we assess the macroeconomic difficulty saying that big ticket long payback items were important. They would help to ease our recovery and they have.", "We said that we would invest in strategic areas that would be decisive growing forward and those efforts appear to be working well. We\u2019ve maintained our van network; it\u2019s more enthusiastic and more stable than when we entered the difficulties. We said that critical industries would be quarter [ph] growth. We are growing strongly in that arena. The industrial division was up 34% in the quarter.", "We were convinced that our technology and reputation would enable expansion with repair shop owners. Equipment in RS&I are confirming that belief. Equipment shook off the natural third quarter headwinds and grew strongly in both the US and Europe, and we said emerging markets, presented with the unique opportunity of physically provisioned, would help us grow and we are growing and gaining in those areas. Those regions are growing at deep double-digits, well ahead of even the robust GDPs.", "No one can predict how the environment will unfold. The economies of the world are still fragile, having said that, however. We now have three quarters of positive Snap-on momentum. The situation seems to be playing out as we expected and our strategic programs are successful. Because of all that, we are more confident than ever before that Snap-on is well positioned to take strong advantage of the future, strong advantage of the future in whatever shape it unfolds.", "Before taking questions, I want to end by thanking the people responsible for these encouraging results, our associates and franchisees. I know as usual, many of you are listening. These results would not have been possible without your capability and your dedication. I thank you for your support and I congratulate you on your success.", "Operator, now we\u2019ll take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll first go to Jim Lucas, Janney Montgomery Scott.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Thanks, good morning all.", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Hello, Jim", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "I want to start with a couple of housekeeping questions. First, on the restructuring, what is the year-to-date number?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Year-to-date number in restructuring is about \u2013 I think it\u2019s like $8 million, $8.4 million or $8.5 million, something like that.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. I thought you were about half-way to the target which implies. Do you anticipate that full $15 million spend?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "I mean, you do the arithmetic, it says six and change in the fourth quarter, but last year, we did seven in change. So, I mean, I don\u2019t think we think that\u2019s an extraordinary amount.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay. And with the early successes you\u2019re having on the emerging market strategy, could you just bring us up-to-date on where you stand today from a geographical footprint, North America versus Europe versus the emerging markets?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "You mean the sales?", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "The sales, yes.", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Yes, it\u2019s roughly this way, I think. You can say, look, North America is 65%, 66% of the business, Europe is 25% of the business, emerging markets. Asia-Pacific is 8 -- between 5% and 10% of the business and the rest is dribs and drabs, Latin America and so on.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Okay. And on the critical industries, glad to hear that the new vision tool box is out there and that\u2019s a great example on the aerospace side. Can you talk a little bit about, which of the critical industries you\u2019re having the best success in and far and is that geographically spread out or it more end market specific?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Actually, the success in industrial, which I think I said really success in industrial\u2019s been across the board geographically, at least generally almost all the quarters we\u2019ve seen, the critical industries have been pretty strong in United States, Europe and so on. This quarter was showed strong gains from aerospace to mining to natural resources. I think the strongest in this quarter was natural resources for us, but if you look back over some period, we\u2019ve seen growth in each of those areas. But in this quarter, we saw a nice bump out of the natural resource business.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay and I know that it\u2019s probably a little too early to be talking about 2011 at least on public environment, most companies answer this question, but clearly the third quarter was a positive surprise from the season, not having the normal impact and it does signify that those of us that have been waiting to see this sort of long time on the outside as I know it has been the same on the inside, very good to see. But as you start looking ahead, not just to the fourth quarter but 2011, can you talk about -- you talked a lot about what\u2019s going to happen on the reward side, but from headwinds, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, from a headwind point of view, I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen in Spain. We\u2019ve got a lot of business there. It seems to be bumping along the bottom, so I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to recover. ", "So, in terms of looking at where improvements going to come from, and looking from recovery, I have a question marked myself about Southern Europe. ", "You can talk about commodity prices, a lot is talked about in terms of commodity, we don\u2019t see for us a major headwinds because we do get commodity prices, but as you know Jim, a lot of our products are not so much material as they are labored, so our increases are not very devastating and plus we generally comprise for recognized commodity increases, so that\u2019s not such a problem for us. ", "You could say, you can take a look at critical industries and say okay, well, will the military spend as much as they have in the past, maybe they won\u2019t, that could be a headwind that we have to offset some places. Some people are talking about restocking, but for us we see almost none. ", "So, the 34% we saw in the critical industries in the industrial division in third quarter had almost, and only restocking. I can tell you that we just went through our quarterly reviews here and I don\u2019t think restocking came up at all in a week of discussion.", "So, we are not seeing that as a factor, so for us the headwinds are mostly around, what\u2019s going to happen in Southern Europe, could there be some variation and some cooling in critical industries, but we don\u2019t expect a lot. We expect that to continue reasonably good because we\u2019ve seen it for many quarters now, and some of the traditional headwinds for some other businesses like commodities or restocking, we\u2019re not seeing in our future.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "As then just, as a reminder with regard to that industrial business, what is the rough percentage mix of direct versus distribution there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "You know, I have to say that about 70-30.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Okay.", "Aldo Pagliari", "", "Most of its direct. I mean, 70 being direct. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons of course, why you don\u2019t have a lot of people in between you and the end customer, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see the restocking as much.", "Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott", "Great, well, congrats on a very good third quarter.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next one is Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Yeah, this is actually Steven Gregory from Mandalay Research. A couple of things Nick, this is one of the calls I always looking forward to every quarter, you\u2019re very enthusiastic and do a great job to continued success.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Couple of things, about two months ago in the Wall Street journal there was an article written, how 2011 is going to be really \u2013 critical for companies to drive more revenue online. Can you provide some color on the call today as, what is your e-commerce vision going forward and how do you plan to drive more revenue through your really good website?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think, in terms of our van business, we offered the price \u2013 in United States in the traditional tool business that you\u2019ve for Snap-on, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much revenue in that business because our customers in that van business is about 35% of it, see real added from the up closing and personal delivery of the product. ", "So, I don\u2019t see that happening there, now I want you to remember that we are about making work easier for professionals in critical tasks. So the online piece of our business, the online delivery does not provide as much opportunity for us, really, you may see some online delivery with some of our distributor activities and that\u2019s more B-to-B in that situation, but that\u2019s really where we, I\u2019d say we limited to. ", "Our sticks if you will, our value is that, we sell to customers and we convince them, we sell the customers whoa are performing critical path and we convince them that they are going to see real productivity in using our solutions and our product. And that usually requires face-to-face. ", "Now, after you convince them you can see some kind of structural ordering, but it\u2019s not a big factor in our business.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "\t", "So, driving people aside to buy some of your cars, battery packs and stuff like that is not rally, usually an initiative to kind of a status code really?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It can, but the thing is that we remember when you are talking about a guy, a van driver, he wants to get it right now, he goes out there and his big value is that when he\u2019s talking to the technician and technician say I need it now and we\u2019ve got it right there boom, its off the truck and he has it now. He doesn\u2019t have to wait for delivery.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Hopefully, on your website, whom are you targeting on your website. I guess why you didn\u2019t have it up, wasn\u2019t it or is there specific\u2026?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, our websites are targeting people who want the order that way, but it\u2019s most around trying to create brand awareness.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Okay, do you any revenue methods that how much your revenue \u2026?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s a very small percentage of our business.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Very small.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t have any metrics.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Are you guys building Mobile Apps for your \u2013 any sight at all? ", "Nick Pinchuk", "You\u2019ve being a little garbled. I didn't hear that, could you say it again please?", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Companies obviously are looking to mobile or social media, are you guys doing anything for mobile or social media to gather more attention in the community, get people more to your site, whether they purchase or not, but to get people more involved with your site? Are you building any Mobile Apps for the iPhone or anything?", "", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think [Multiple Speaker].", "Aldo Pagliari", "We do use some of those features, but they are oriented towards our franchisees. Our effort is to increase the productivity of the franchisees and not so much for the end user technicians. ", "So, all those you were describing are an excellent tool from an RCI perspective. We also used the web for supplier based activity, but when it comes to end user purchases it\u2019s not the preferred means is to how they conduct the trade.", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "One of these, we talked about in terms of productivity for our van and that\u2019s, we\u2019ve identified that as one of our best opportunities is continuous improvement of their computer systems or their IT systems. And in fact we are rolling out a new system in Canada, as we speak and that will be spread out throughout the United States, okay?", "Steven Gregory - Mandalay Research", "And final question, going forward, for 2011 and beyond. Where would you like to see the company head, if you could picture a perfect world, not like revenue stream or profit? Where would you like to be a couple years from now?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think we have said in the call, and I said many times, we see substantial runways for growth, particularly around critical industries, around repair shop owners and managers, and in emerging markets. ", "We also see opportunities to grow our van business, but those are two, three places. Critical industries, repair shop owners and emerging market, and I see those businesses being a bigger part of our company. We are going to continue to pursue roll down those runways, because in the third quarter, I think is abundant evidence that those runaways are clearing for us. ", "Now we have said, I think that moving forward, after the recession recovers, after we recover the recession, after recession recovery goes away, we believe we can register between 4% and 6% organic growth consistently and we believe we can drive towards strong mid-teen OI margins. ", "And we believe that we will get that through organic growth and then also in those critical runaways we can find both on acquisition, so I see as pursuing that moving forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Moving on, we hear from David Leiker, Robert W. Baird.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning. How are you all?", "Nick Pinchuk", "David.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "I just want to follow-up on a couple of things, here. The organic growth number here is 13%. You answered one of my questions, how much you think there's restocking there. But how much do you think is pent up demand is part of that as opposed to the market growing or market share gains?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s always a tough question, but look I\u2019ll say this, it\u2019s pretty clear, we\u2019re growing market share with van. It\u2019s pretty clear, it\u2019s clear that we are growing share in industrial with critical industries, 34% is gaining buster\u2019s number. ", "I can\u2019t tell you how much but we are seeing that expansion. And it\u2019s on top of, if you go back previous session, we were growing strong, double-digit in a moderate economy in that areas, so I think this is just extension of that.", "Of course we are growing share in emerging markets, and I think one of the places where our people on the ground say we are expanding, is in Europe. Europe was up double-digits even though is in fact to \u201908 levels, everybody, a lot of people are saying they are up in Europe, but what we see in Europe is the customers aren\u2019t going way, but the smaller player seem to be contracting.", "So, our people on the ground in Europe say we are gaining share even there. I can\u2019t part between, I can\u2019t tell you which part of that is, is market share \u2013it\u2019s share increase and return, but if you look at things like, if you look at places like equipment and the critical industries, equipments up strong double-digits almost 20%, over 20% critical industries are up 30%. You see Europe up double-digit, I think if you look at the economies there locally you are not going to see anything like that number, you have to conclude we are gaining shares in those areas of the significant amount.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "On a longer term basis, you said you\u2019ve got organic growth of 4% to 6% and your running 13%. You get to that normalized rate, do you think that's two quarters out, four quarters out, how would you characterize the progression to that number? ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I would simple say this, it think if you look at this we are going to keep growing at strong double-digits in Asia-Pacific. We\u2019re going, I think we\u2019re backed the pre-prices levels in the van business, so I don\u2019t know what should expect. We are back the pre-crisis levels. ", "We are starting to get the pre-crisis levels in our critical industries, were by the way we are growing at double-digit and Europe is the wildcard David, because I don\u2019t, I can predict how that\u2019s going to come back, that\u2019s got a long way to come back to 2008. I really can\u2019t say were we\u2019re going to get back the stabilize numbers.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And then on the critical industry side, where would you say you are in your game plan in terms of penetrating those end markets of having a presence and a product for those markets? Do you think it's pretty much where you want and now it's like a share opportunity or do you think there's still some market opportunities there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Can you say that again, I am getting, I\u2019m must have some bad connection, because I didn\u2019t get, did you say about emerging markets?", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "No, in the critical industries, where you think you are in terms of penetrating that in terms of having that right product in the right markets presences versus still having opportunities to broaden your exposure on this?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Yes, okay. Based on where we started, based on the opportunity that I see, based on the, I think, the incidence of people coming to me with both product and customer opportunities, it\u2019s the end game of a 10, I would we\u2019re at 2.5.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W Baird", "Okay. And the last item on that is who do you think you\u2019re gaining share from in those critical industries?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Well, I think there\u2019s a number of people, I mean, there\u2019s a number of people. Certainly we have our big competitors like Armstrong and Proto in the United States. In Europe, you have Gador, you have Sanville you have Usag and those are the broad tool manufactures and then you have some specific people that do like pliers and other things, of smaller products like Nepex in Europe.", "So I\u2019d say we\u2019re gaining from a collective group. We can\u2019t offer a wider range of products than anybody else David. So, when we sell a kit to an aerospace company or we sell a kit to the military, we\u2019re usually displacing a number of different competitors. ", "When we sell to Shanghai Airlines, we maybe replacing a German competitor or Japanese competitor and a Chinese competitor at the same time. So it\u2019s a mix.", "David Leiker \u2013 Robert W Baird", "Okay. Thank you very much, and have a great quarter.", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now move to David Manger, Morningstar.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Hello.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "We go to the next person in the queue please.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We\u2019ll next move to Gary Prestopino, Barrington Research", ".", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "", "Hi, good morning.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Hi, Gary.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "Can you hear me?", "Nick Pinchuk", "", "Yes.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "", "Hey Aldo, I try to ask a question before I got cut-off. What did you say was the goal with the portfolio by the end of Q4? Did you give a number there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "", "I did actually. I mean, we said, consistently we expected from the beginning of this year to add about $300 million for the overall portfolio. So, if you do the mathematics, we should end up at about $565 million to $570 million by year end is our projection for the Snap-on Credit portfolio.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "", "That\u2019s US, right?", "Aldo Pagliari", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "", "Okay. Alright, and then the ultimate goal with the overall portfolio to get it, or maybe I\u2019m wrong, is the US ultimate goal to get to about 700?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think more closely Gary to about $750 million or so. Historically if you look at the combined portfolio they exceed over $800 million in the half or sometime. As I\u2019ve said before in our investor meeting, is that we probably do a little bit less van leasing going forward, there are other sources of funding for our credit strategies on that dimension on a very competitive, we have no problem with them using those.", "But we look at our extended credit portfolio and our leasing of equipment portfolio with that in there, I think we see of about 750ish and again internationally, again we expect at least $130 million and we look to the future to see if this opportunity to grow that, but I\u2019d like to at a combined portfolio of about $900 million, $880, $900 million right now in the terms of a future state.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "Okay. And then in terms of some of these growth markets like critical industries and the emerging markets, could you maybe size each of these markets on a worldwide basis as you see it? And then maybe give us some idea of what the revenues are in each of these markets currently?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well. Sure, I think I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s very difficult to size the market state for critical industries because it\u2019s so vertical and there are so many different aspects of it and what products do you include in it. But I would say for example that, we\u2019ve said that, that business has the clear potential to be as big as our tools group, that business alone and today that business is somewhere between lets say $350 million to $400 million.", "But, we think that\u2019s relative to where we are now that\u2019s quite unbounded. And emerging markets its anybody guess, but Gary they are going to sell more cars in China this year than United States and I think that place out in terms of airframe and then full other things in power plants and so on. ", "And so when you see our opportunities there and realizing that the repair market hasn\u2019t started yet, because there is 300 million vehicles on the road and there are 45% over 10 years old now and in China even though they\u2019re pound in a lot of vehicles into the park right now. There is still only 15 million on the road and they are all new, you can see the China market alone being as big as in the US market and therefore being kind of the size of the van business again. Again there are various difficult - -", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "Emerging markets, I mean you kind of gave a range of 5% to 10% of revenues?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "That we are .. ", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes. That\u2019s were we are today, yep.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "So if you dial back a year or two years ago where were you was as a percentage of revenues?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know that number, but it\u2019s been growing dramatically, on a small base. So I really don\u2019t have that, it was quite a bit small, I have just said that, I think you and I have spoken about this is that, if you go back to 2004 let\u2019s say are those kind of years we hardly sold anything in Asia, we got ten people in two offices, so it\u2019s really - -", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "So is your main competition and say place like China is that like a domestic manufacture - -", "Nick Pinchuk", "It depends on the industry if you tend to, it depends on the particular product in the industry, but let\u2019s say for example, it can be some times there can be imported product for or some times for lets say Shanghai Airlines, your competition will be imported, but for let say the Volkswagen OVM dealership, it will be primarily local. ", "And it\u2019s a galaxy of competitors, the thing about China and India and all emerging markets, they\u2019re generally fragmented, that\u2019s why we like the opportunity actually.", "Gary Prestopino \u2013 Barrington Research", "Thank you.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "I\u2019d just like to say, we appreciate you interest in Snap-on.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, I'd say our first quarter results were positive. And I believe they once again confirm clear progress in strengthening our strategic position and in improving our operating execution. When you look at the first quarter, you can be encouraged by the performance and quite positive regarding the Snap-on future. Volumes in the period were up 10% from last year. It was actually the best volume performance we've had in relation to pre-recession levels. Adjusted for FX, our sales were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings were up more than 42% with a 12.6% operating margin before financial services, 100 basis points higher than last year. And we registered $12.5 million in earnings from financial services, an over $14 million increase. Consolidated operating margin of 13.9% was up 280 basis points from 2010. On the overall environment, I think it's fair to say that the landscape is not nearly as unpredicted in nuance as it has been over the past couple of years. We believe we now have clearer visibility and that alone is a positive for us. While there are some pockets of challenge, as you would expect when you have a global operation, there was broad progress in the vast majority of our businesses that more than offset the few difficulties. For example, the businesses serving the automotive space showed considerable strength. You can see that reflected in the nearly 12% volume increase of both the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. These are businesses where we track the activity in what we call big-ticket items, high-value products, things like diagnostics, undercar equipment and tool storage units. As we've been saying, the customers' willingness to make commitments to those types of buys give us an insight into their financial health and into their confidence in the future. During the downturn when the outlook was uncertain, these products were particularly hard hit. They turned the corner in the middle of last year and an upward trend continued into the first quarter of 2011. So these recent results confirm that big-ticket is back and that optimism is strong. Also, in new automotive space, we do have some activity that's tied directly to OEM dealerships -- to OEM dealerships rather than independent. As the number of dealerships continue to shrink in the U.S., it has created a headwind for us. As an offset, we've been increasing global essential tool activity, which is driven by the OEMs and we've also been capturing Electronic Parts Catalog business in adjacent markets. So while the U.S. dealership rooftops are still contracting, the RS&I group has been recording solid gains, capturing other business and overcoming the turmoil. From a geographic perspective, again, it was an extension of what we've been seeing in the past few quarters. For example, in Europe, we continue to see a general improvement. Double-digit gains were the norm in the region from our industrial division to the big-ticket equipment products, to our European Hand Tools business or SNA Europe. It now seems that European weakness for us is limited to the South and especially Spain, where SNA Europe does have a particularly strong presence. Spain was down a bit again, even from last year's already depressed levels. We're just not seeing much favorable movement in that market. Overall though, the general European improvement, especially in the U.K. and Scandinavia more than made up for Spain. ", "Turning to emerging markets. They also remain strong and the expansion in those arenas was another positive. In Eastern Europe, our fortified presence with our new Minsk plant helped drive significant increase in Belarus, in Russia and the Ukraine. And no surprise, Asia-Pacific had strong double-digit gains again, driven by increased penetration in India, Thailand and China. Related to Asia Pacific, I think it's the topic the day, as you would expect, we saw some initial impact from the tragic events in Japan. We're down in that country by about 5%. We were fortunate that our associates and franchisees came through the earthquake and tsunami safely. Having said that though, there is an unsettled business environment in Japan and going forward, any impact will be in place for an entire quarter rather than for only a month as was the case in the first quarter. However, for us, sales in Japan are only a small percentage of the company's total volume and our most significant activity in that country tends to be outside the northeast where the most disruption is occurring. So while nobody can predict how the Japan market will play out, it will certainly be another headwind for a while. But we've demonstrated in the recent path that we've been able to overcome, to manage through challenges by finding offsets where increased opportunities present themselves. The other consideration related to Japan is component sourcing. Of course, like most companies, we do have some exposure particularly as related to the diagnostics product, but we're already working with suppliers to offset or to mitigate any short-term supply chain problems and again, to find offsets. So that's the overall market update. No major surprises and we think that's favorable. Still a few headwinds, but fairly broad growth carrying us through in driving overall gains. ", "Now I'll say a bit on each operating segment. The commercial industrial group or C&I saw sales increase 10.3%, including a couple of points due to foreign exchange. The operating margin was 11.6% up from 10.3% last year. I already spoke about the favorable environment and growth we saw in emerging markets in Europe. The C&I group is where most of that business resides and the uplift in those geographies did aid the group's growth. Let's speak for a moment about critical industries. C&I is where we're focused on extending the power of our brands and our capabilities into critical industries. And as we said before, we see great opportunity for expansion in that effort and in this quarter, there were some strong positive improvements. In the aerospace sector, we're building a strong position. And Automated Tool Control or ATC has been a high-profile product that's provided a great boost. I've mentioned it in the past, it's a new technology for this type of application. Laser imaging, originally developed for the undercar aligners but used here to control tools, to make sure they're not left in the aircraft engine. I guess I'd say that I can't think of any task more critical than that. GC, the smart tool storage box, gets a lot of exposure and attention. It's really the broad expansion of our product line, more hand tools, torque products and power tools developed specifically for aerospace applications that drove double-digit volume growth in this area. We also saw strong increase, also double digits, in the critical natural resources arena. This industry's a natural fit for us. Professionals performing critical tasks with a need for quality and reliability and a high cost of failure. So we're pleased with that progress. Now the expansion in critical industries isn't just limited to the Snap-on brand on our industrial division, SNA Europe has also grown it's offering in large tools designed for the critical mining industry under this strong Bahco brand and we're gaining position there. Our advancements in that space fueled some significant growth in the quarter. For example, in South America, Chile had a fine quarter led by the mining sector. So we continued to make progress in critical industries and we saw solid growth in most of those segments, like aerospace and natural resources. We also had headwinds, like lower military spending and field operations as sealed operations wind down around the globe. That was a partial offset to the many advancements in Europe, emerging markets and in critical industries like aerospace and natural resources. This quarter, the C&I story is that broad growth, overcoming a few headwinds to again post solid sales and earnings increase from the prior year. Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians, we had a strong quarter. Sales of $282 million, a record, up 13.5% from last year with 11% organic growth. The OI margin of 13.2% was up 230 basis points from 2010 and that 13.2% includes $2.8 million of restructuring mainly related to our tools storage plant consolidation. Excluding those restructuring costs, the margin exceeded 14%. Though it's clear, the Tools Group is getting stronger.", "I've spoke of the continued strength of big-ticket volumes and that's being supported by some great product launches. Customer connection and innovation, they're important elements of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, they keep delivering winning products. For example, our updated VERUS handheld diagnostic unit has considered -- has generated considerable excitement in the period. The new version incorporates wireless technology. VERUS owners can now scan the vehicle system from anywhere in the shop. It's a productivity enhancer that builds on our already market-leading position. And if you have a prior version of the VERUS, there's an update -- an update kit is available and that's also been well received. Last year, we launched the new VERDICT handheld in the U.S. It's simply the most sophisticated diagnostic unit available anywhere and that launch, that product was a big it. Well, we took that product to the U.K. just this past month and it started out with the same strong reception, just like the U.S. It's another strong step in solidifying Snap-on's leadership in that important European market. And while we're discussing the Tools Group, I think it's important to highlight the strength of the van channel. We worked hard to support the network through the downturn. We identified that as being strategically important and we are investing to that end and it's paying off. We monitor a number of metrics to gauge the health of our franchisees business and many of those indicators are at the best levels we've ever seen. Obviously, sales are up, all-time high and that helps. But importantly, franchisee turnover is down and keeps going in the right direction, down. Loan delinquencies are at a low -- at low levels and we've improved internal execution all over the corporation. An example is another of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, RCI, helps us keep improving our complete and on-time delivery performance to the franchisees. So the van network, better than ever before. But beyond the network, beyond the metrics, I'll tell you that when you talk to franchisees, when you speak with them, enthusiasm is high. Consider our annual kick-off meetings that are held each January this year and -- at each January. And this year, we had the highest participation ever with over 80% of the franchisees attending and sales at these events this year were up nearly 50% from 2010. So the channel appears healthy. And when that's coupled with our strong Snap-on brand and our unique finance company, we have a substantial advantage in this space. The results show it and we believe there's much more upside. ", "Let's move to the RS&I group, where Snap-on is expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales increased 11.7% from last year, led by increases in undercar products and essential tool and facilities -- facilitation activities. The volume helped drive operating margins 18.9%, up from 18.3% last year. We're ramping up our product development efforts especially in this group and it's paying off with better and expanding position. This group is in fact fueling some of the big-ticket strength in the Tools Group with the diagnostic products I just mentioned through the van channel. Additionally related, thought, to big-ticket category, are liner volumes, sold through the equipment division which is part of our RS&I, were up double digits in both North America and in Europe. And our equipment operations -- when you think about equipment, it's also key at collaborating with our Asian team as we take our technology and capabilities to that region with products specifically designed for those markets and that process, that support, that collaboration is working well, as evidenced by the growth we're seeing in that emerging arena.", "I'll just add 1 more item for RS&I and that's our expanding position in serving the medium and heavy-duty truck market. We've been making investments because it's a natural opportunity for Snap-on. For example, Mitchell, our business that provides shop and repair information, has expanded its offering beyond just cars into the Truck segment. And it's now gaining in commercial and truck fleets. An important part of our strategy also working with the truck engine OEMs and our partnerships here are growing through both Snap-on Business Solutions and EQS businesses. We develop both handheld and PC-based diagnostics products that serve as essential tools for the engine manufacturers and dealer networks and also serve as broadly versatile products for independent truck repair shops. That breadth of new products is generating significant presence and it's helping us offset some of the weakness inherent in the shrinking rooftops of the automotive OEM dealerships. ", "So those are the highlights for the quarter. Considerable advancement in the 4 strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future. Enhancing the franchise channel, expanding with shop owners and managers, extending out of the garage into critical industries and building emerging markets. The results, they confirm progress in each of those areas and we're confident that those strengthening initiatives, when coupled with the improvements driven by our Snap-on Value Creation, will assure that the positive trend we've already established and now reinforce with the first quarter results will continue for some time to come. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall, revenue growth continued profitability increases in financial services and what we believe are significant benefits from our Snap-on Value Creation Processes generated a 52% improvement year-over-year net earnings and diluted earnings per share. Net sales in the first quarter of $694 million dollars increased $72 million or 11.6% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 10%. We continued to realize year-over-year sales growth throughout our businesses, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, increased sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I group and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries in our Commercial and Industrial or C&I group. Consolidated gross profit of $331 million in the quarter increased $43 million from 2010 levels as a result of higher sales, favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives and favorable foreign currency effects. Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% in the quarter increased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243 million increased $27 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses including: $6.8 million of increased performance-based and stock-based compensation including mark-to-market, $2.3 million of anticipated higher pension expense and $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These operating expense increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense and benefits from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were 35.1% as compared to 34.7% last year. Restructuring costs of $3 million in the first quarter were comparable to last year's $3.2 million. Financial services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the quarter improved $14.2 million from the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. On a sequential basis, Financial Services' operating earnings improved $3.1 million from fourth quarter 2010 levels. As expected, operating earnings from Financial Services continues to improve as our on-book finance portfolio grows. Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $2.3 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to a higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. As anticipated, our first quarter 2011 effective income tax rate was 33% compared to 34.5% a year ago. Finally, net earnings in the first quarter of $56.2 million or $0.96 per diluted share increased $19.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share from 2010 levels. ", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $272 million for the first quarter improved 10.3% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 8.4%. Continued higher sales to customers in emerging markets, increased sales in the segment's European-based Hand Tool business and continued sales progress in the critical industries of aerospace and natural resources more than offset lower year-over-year sales to the military. And as Dick mentioned, while our organic sales in Japan were down in the quarter, it did not significantly impact our overall results. Gross profit in the C&I segment of $103.6 million in the quarter increased $14.9 million from 2010 levels, largely due to higher sales of favorable manufacturing utilization, savings from ongoing RCI restructuring initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Gross margin of 38% in the quarter improved 210 basis points from 35.9% last year. Operating expenses of $72 million in the quarter increased $8.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.4% as compared to 25.6% last year. First quarter operating earnings of $31.6 million for the C&I segment increased $6.2 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins in the C&I segment of 11.6% improved 130 basis points from 10.3% last year. ", "Turning now to Slide 8. On a worldwide basis, first quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13.5% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. On an organic basis, sales were up 11.7%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125 million in the quarter increased nearly $20 million from last year's levels. This increase includes contributions from higher sales and favorable manufacturing utilization and $1.7 million of favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by $2.3 million of higher restructuring costs, primarily due to the previously communicated consolidation of our North American Tools Storage operations into our Algona, Iowa facility. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 200 basis points from 42.3% last year. Operating expenses of $87.8 million in the quarter increased $9.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.1% improved 30 basis points from 2010 levels. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $37.1 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million or 37.4% from the $27 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.2% increased 200 ", "[Audio Gap]", "Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $227 million increased 12.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 11.7%, reflecting higher sales of undercar equipment and increased essential tool and facilitation program activity with automotive OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter increased $8.4 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales, lower restructuring costs and contributions from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45% compared to 46.4% last year. The 140 basis point decline is largely due to higher relative growth in the sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program sales.", "Operating expenses of $59.3 million in the quarter increased $2.6 million from 2010 levels, as higher volume related product development and other costs were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses improved 200 basis points year-over-year. Operating earnings of $42.8 million for the RS&I segment increased $5.8 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margins of 18.9% improved 60 basis points from 2010. ", "Now turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $12.5 million in the first quarter compares favorably to both fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million and to the first quarter 2010 loss of $1.7 million. The $14.2 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the higher revenue contributions from our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $145 million in the quarter increased 24.2% compared to the first quarter 2010 levels, reflecting improved approval rates and greater participation in our credit programs. ", "Moving to Slide 11. At the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $785 million of gross financing receivables including $640 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $530 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2010 year end, our total on-book financing portfolio has grown about $50 million and we expect for the full year 2011 that our on-book finance portfolio will increase approximately $130 million over 2010 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. ", "Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $27.9 million for the quarter compares to $10.4 million last year. Our quarter end cash position of $517 million decreased $55 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, increased working investment in capital expenditures partially offset by higher net earnings. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3 million from the operating company, and as expected, a negative $35 million from financial services reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Capital expenditures totaled $18.6 million in the quarter, reflecting our continued commitment to planned strategic investments. ", "As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. As of quarter end, inventory levels were up $39 million versus 2010 year end, primarily to support higher levels of customer demand and as a result of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.4x compared to 4.2x at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and 4.7x at 2010 year and. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $653.2 million. Our net debt to cap ratio of 30.5% compares to 25.9% last year and 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the $250 million December note issuance. Excluding the $107.8 million withheld for the previously disclosed dispute with CIT, our quarter end net-debt-to-cap ratio would have been 33.8%. In addition to our of $517 million in cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of the first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. ", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. So we're quite encouraged by the quarter's results. There are still challenges with continuing weakness in Spain, the U.S. dealership consolidation and now the uncertainty surrounding Japan. There are always challenges and weaknesses. We've consistently demonstrated the ability to overcome headwinds. The improvements of this quarter are a testimony to the strength of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Rapid Continuous Improvement, innovation, customer connection, quality and safety. It's a solid framework that's propelled us forward and we believe it will continue to do so. ", "We also said we would invest in the areas that we believe are decisive for our future and represent major runways for growth. We're doing that, and it's working. We said we'd enhance the van network. All the health metrics and the franchisees themselves say the vans have never been better. Extend to critical industries. We saw strong gains in aerospace and natural resources. Expand with repair shops owners and managers. Our SN&I absorbed dealership consolidation and still grew strongly and build in emerging markets. Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific are growing well ahead of GDP. I mentioned in the past that we're confident we'd emerge from the downturn stronger than when we entered, while the first quarter did provide some strong evidence that we did just that. Volumes were back to the Q1 2008 levels at constant currency. And our OpCo margin of 12.6% was 140 basis points higher than it was in that pre-recession period. And remember that in achieving that improvement, we shook off higher pension costs which are, after all, related to the financial crisis. And that represented an additional 130 basis points of expense. So our ongoing operating structure is significantly improved. ", "All of that, Snap-on value creation, investments and decisive strategic positions, the credit company contributing more as projected and the first quarter results. We believe those are strong signals that Snap-on is well positioned for continued improvement and to take full advantage of the broad runways for growth that are now clearly evident before us in the quarters and years ahead. ", "Before I close, I want to again express my appreciation and gratitude to all our associates and franchisees for their commitment. I know many of you are listening in to this call. You are responsible for the progress that's been made, that's been achieved and for the encouraging first quarter results. You have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, thank you, sir.  [Operator Instructions]  We'll take our first question from Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "A couple of questions here. First, C&I, I thought it was interesting that you called out military as 1 of the headwinds, and I wanted to see if we could just drill down a bit further because, I mean, clearly, the comps are getting tougher in C&I. But not that 8.5% core growth is not shabby by any means, but what would the growth rate have been without that military headwind?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I think it would have been a few percent up, but I think the thing about C&I is, you said it first, to use the New York expression, I'm from New York, 8% isn't chopped liver, we think. And so we think it's pretty good. And then if you look at overall C&I sequentially, this is about in line with the sequential seasonality that you see in the C&I. So overall, we feel pretty encouraged by the quarter in C&I. If you look at the way C&I behaves in the first quarter, you have in there the Asia-Pacific businesses which are generally down in the first quarter seasonality wise because of Chinese New Year. And you have the idea that the fourth quarter is a little bit up because you've got the sort of year-end budget cycle plans through the industrial businesses. So the C&I numbers, we think, are pretty encouraging.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. Again, I just wanted a little clarification since you had called it out. And then switching gears to RS&I, facilitation, which we haven't heard much about the last few quarters, did you sign any new facilitation contracts? And what kind of headwind was that on margins?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think you're just seeing more Facilitation business come through. I think the dealers are coming out. I think what you see there is the auto industry getting a little stronger and recovering from what was 1 of the deeper recessions. And so the dealerships after the consolidation of dealerships are feeling a little more robust in placing in a few more orders. We didn't get any more big contracts or anything like that. The Facilitation business, though, can be like 15 points down from the average.", "Aldo Pagliari", "There's about a -- there could be a 15 point variation given the market performance when you're selling Facilitation versus the other business units that are in the RS&I.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And that's reflected more in the gross profit line?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes. Sure.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. Then bigger picture, I mean, it was interesting and good to hear that the big-ticket demand has remained, but with gas prices now $4 and that magic number seeming to get back in the headlines more and more, have you heard anything either from your dealers specifically or seen any changes in the technician's buying patterns?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No. We haven't seen that yet. Or I don't -- our view of this, when gas prices go up, miles driven tends to react, I think, to the change in gas prices not to the absolute. A little bit like this, the gas prices go up the guy gets mad, he stops driving for a weekend, then he gets tired of being home. And so he tends to drive a bit more. But even through that period, when gas prices last went up in 2008, we didn't see much impact to our revenues. So I wouldn't expect to see it, I wouldn't expect to see it over the spread of a longer term. I don't really expect that. And we certainly haven't seen any yet. Now gas prices can impact our franchisee base somewhat in that they drive and they have diesel fuel, but it's not a major factor. You're talking about for every dollar of diesel price rise, you get about less than 1% increase in cost and that's usually offsetable in a number of ways. We did the last time, we're working on it now.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. And then final question, on the topic of cost, can you just give us an update of what you're seeing on the inflation side and the expectation for full-year price versus inflation?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes. We do see some cost increases. Remember, our exposure is not that high, we don't -- a big component of our business, certainly Hand Tool business is labor, but we do have some exposure in steel and in freight and component and so on. And we see some of that drifting too. I think the good news is steel seems to be abating for us a little bit now. But we do see some costs, but we're seeing evidence, like we've always said, that we're able to price against that. As long as -- our tried-and-true situation has been, our demonstrated situation is, is that when the inflation is visible, when it's something like steel or freight or gasoline, we're able to price for it when people recognize that's the environment. If it's something like nickel or something a little more obscure, that might be another issue. But in terms of this, we see ourselves being able to price and we have been able to price when we've seen inflation here in this quarter.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay, great. Well congrats on a good start to the year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Can you, on the portfolio for the financial services, you've given us some idea of what the originations would be domestically. International, are -- can you give us any idea where that would be? Or does that stay kind of stagnant there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Well, Gary, international portfolio did grow since last time. Sequentially, it's up about $4 million and I expect that it will continue to grow, not as rapid an absolute number as what you see on the U.S. side. And that's simply because we don't have all the mechanisms of Snap-on Credit extended globally at this point in time. That's something we have on our long-term vision is to how can we project some of the finance company attributes internationally? That's why we talked mostly about the U.S. portfolio.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "So with originations that you've given us for U.S., we're looking at something of between $860 million, $870 million as a year-end portfolio overall, Aldo? Was that about right?", "Aldo Pagliari", "That's a good estimate, I'd say up at about the $865 million mark, considering we have a robust origination experience in Q1. So we came out of the box stronger. It is typical in Q1 because we have -- it reflects the growth of the Snap-on Tools Group more than anything else. Snap-on has a lot of what we call kick-off meetings in the first quarter. So a lot of the products that are featured in that program tend to led themselves to contract finance arrangements. So the first quarter tends to be a little bit more robust. But certainly we came out strong so I'd say $865 million is a -- $870 million is a reasonable expectation for full year.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just 1 more question on that. The CIT receivables that are managed by SOC, when does that run off entirely?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Well, the contracts tend to have an average duration in the extended credit arena of about 3 years. So if you go back from July of '09, you'll say well, we're starting to get towards the average duration of where those will be. But all don't perform equally. Some of the ones that don't have what we call a renewed business or add-on performance can lag to their entire duration and go out the full 3-year to 5-year cycle. Also in there there's a pocket of van leases and there's some long-term leasing of equipment. We don't usually see those terminate early or come to early payment. So those could be laggard to the portfolio. So the bulk of the extended credit will run off this year. The remainder of it could be a tail that hangs out there for a few years, but it will create much less noise in 2012 than what it does this year.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just last question. It seems that you're at a -- total company wide, a more normalized level of operations relative to where the worldwide economies are. So as we think of your quarters, Q2 would be the second strongest sales quarter, Q4 would be the least -- Q3 would be the least and then Q4 would be the strongest. Is that how we should think about that?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes. That's generally right, but it's not wildly different. The big seasonality in our business, Gary, most definitely is the third quarter. And so everything else, it's kind of noise around it. You're talking about the third quarter down 5% or 6% or 7%, that kind of thing. But we generally think -- I think I've said on these calls that it's very difficult to judge anything from the third quarter results. It could be up and down, depending on whether the Europeans come back from vacation or go longer, those kinds of things.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Dax Vlassis with Gates Capital Management.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Yes. If I look at the internal growth rate of the company for the quarter, I think it was about 10%. How much of that was units and how much of that was pricing?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "There wasn't very much pricing in that. I would say minimal pricing.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Okay. But you said that the -- that you're...", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure. But the thing is, we're seeing that much -- we're not seeing that much material on inflation either. So we're not seeing much in terms of pricing. I would say less than 1% would be pricing.", "Aldo Pagliari", "I'd say that the first quarter reflects really pricing actions that took place in Q3, Q4 of last year. And up until the first quarter, we haven't seen a lot of the inflation effects on the commodity front. But we have forward-looking price increases that have already been announced and they'll be in place beginning in April. So we're already in place.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Well, if you raised prices in the second half of last year, you'd have pricing up year-over-year in the first quarter versus the first quarter, no?", "Aldo Pagliari", "And we do. And that's why we say it's probably 1%.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Okay. So it's 1% -- so you're saying it's of the 10%, 1% was pricing, 9% of the units and you had 1% sort of inflationary pressures in your costs.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes. That's a good summary. Yes.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Okay. And the on the cash flows of the company, obviously you seem to put some more working capital in with higher inventories, obviously on the higher sales. On the inventory turns, do you think there's opportunities to improve that? Do you think you'll wring some more cash out of working capital this year on a full-year basis?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I think first of all, there's a seasonal question and so the inventory turns almost seasonally always go down from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. That happens to us. I think the answer is we probably will see some modest improvement, some improvement in working capital as we go forward in the year. There's a seasonality event there. What we did here, and you'll be entitled to view this, we took special action around inventory because I directed the Tools Group to add inventory to offset to make sure that we had no disruption when we made the Tool storage plant consolidation in the United States. And that's happening now. So some of what you're seeing is that. And then secondly, in Europe, as Europe came back, we saw raw material shortages in Europe. And so we asked the Europeans to put in place a little more raw material and whip so that they can serve their customer somewhat better. So you'd be entitled to view that as an idea that, that would come out as the world matures and we put behind us the consolidation in Tool Storage and that's going to happen through the year. And then I believe the raw material situation will stabilize in Europe as we go forward and that inventory will come out.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Right. And then regarding the balance sheet, I mean, if I look at the debt of the company especially the way you sort of, I mean, I guess Financial Services is consolidated but you sort of break it out as sort of a separate entity, as if it were a separate entity, and that if I look at the leverage that you use in that business, it's sort of moderate and on the whole company it's -- if you look at it on a sort of operating basis excluding Financial Services, that it sort of looks extremely low. What is the priority for cash flow? Because it looks like you have, really -- I mean, it looks like you can generate significant amounts of cash and really have nowhere to go with it as far as -- I guess, you have 1 issue of debt pay down that's about $200 million this year but other than that...", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I disagree with the idea of nowhere to go. That's the first thing I'd say. I wouldn't characterize it quite like that. I mean, first of all, we do have cash flows that are associated with the credit company and, of course, as the on-book portfolio comes on, that will leave cash from us. We have to repay the debt and that comes due in the middle of next year. Then we have substantial ideas around organic growth. And you see our capital investment ramping up this year to greater than last year. And we have acquisition opportunities that are coherent to our strategy in critical industries and serving repair shop owners and managers that lay out before it. So I think we have ample places to put that cash.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Well, that's kind of what I was getting at, the acquisition opportunity and sort of how do you view the pipeline for that? And how do you look at the multiples of these businesses? Obviously, given what I'm looking at, the overall company, Snap-on, trades at a relatively cheap multiple. And I'm just wondering about acquisitions, about the amount you'd have to pay for acquisitions versus buying your own stock here.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I think our policy on the stock buyback is more or less we offset dilution. We think we have places where we can put the money at reasonable prices and make a lot out of it. When we acquire somebody, we think we can make them a lot better. Because we've got Snap-on Value Creation Processes. We impose -- when we put that on an acquisition, we can make them better than they were before, because those processes are tight and capable and value creating around safety and quality and customer connection and innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. It did a lot for our company and we acquired ProQuest, the Electronic Parts business in what, late to almost early 2006, late 2007. That business has been rocked by dealership consolidations in the interim and the Snap-on Value Creation system has wrung profitability out of that and allowed us to offset it. So we feel pretty confident we can acquire somebody, 1, and make them better just with Snap-on Value Creation and secondly, and secondly, we can add it to our -- because we're not looking at acquiring somebody that's sort of like -- that's unrelated to our business. We see ourselves saying we can grow coherently. We're just -- we're taking the Snap-on brand out of the garage and into critical industries. So of we would acquire a company that had a position in, let's say aerospace or natural resources and added it to the power of the Snap-on brand, there would be synergies beyond the idea of the processes we would bring to that company. And so there will be tremendous value created. So I'm not so worried about the multiple question.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Well, okay. And just to be clear, when you're talking about, I mean, businesses, you're not talking about buying turnaround situations, you're talking about decent businesses that you would improve.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes. I mean, yes. I'm not saying that we're buying businesses to turn them around, but I think we can improve almost most businesses we see, actually.", "Dax Vlassis - Gates Capital Management", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning to review our results and what we know is a very full earnings release date.

Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's Second Quarter 2011 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.

Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Well, the second quarter results were reasonably strong again, and I think it's safe to say that we're encouraged by the continued progress. Overall sales in the quarter were up 12.2% from last year with some help from exchange rates. Organically, volume rose by over 7%. The overall operating margin was 15.4% and operating income was up more than 44% from 2010, and both of those comparisons exclude the positive effect of the arbitration settlement with CIT.", "The 40-plus percent rise in operating income is similar to what we posted in the past couple of quarters, so these results mark a continuation of an ongoing and strong trend. The profit increase included a $15.8 million rise in earnings from Financial Services, but a real highlight was the quarterly operating margin of 13.6% before Financial Services. That Opco [ph] OI margin represents the highest level Snap-on has achieved in well over 15 years. Now we believe the operating performance and the trend clearly demonstrates the strength of our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's a framework we apply everywhere at every level to improve our performance, and our commitment to those principles and processes are enabling our broad progress.", "Now with respect to the macro environment, the various markets in which we operate, the second quarter was fairly unchanged from what we spoke about 3 months ago. I characterize our performance brought -- our performance has widespread gains in most areas, more than overcoming those few continuing headwinds we mentioned in the past. I'll provide a bit of color on the quarter and cover the highlights for each of the operating groups. And then as usual, Aldo will offer a detailed financial review.", "From a geographic perspective, the same dynamics are present for our operations that have been in play for the past couple of quarters. In North America, no real change. Look, the overall 10% volume growth in the Tools Group reflects the same stable upward trend that we've become accustomed to in North America. Also, the big-ticket diagnostics and tool storage units that are sold in the van channel remain strong, and that's a continuing positive for us.", "Our Undercar Equipment, another big-ticket category was also up in North America, better than our overall sales increase. The same was true in our distribution and general industrial sales in the region.", "Moving to another area of strength, the emerging markets of Asia Pacific. Again this quarter, we saw strong double-digit gains. It's no secret that those markets are expanding, and we're taking advantage as we build presence and gain position. Throughout that jurisdiction, but especially in China, in India, in Indonesia, we're seeing growth, far above both GDP rates and the company's overall pace of growth.", "We continue to see progress in most of Europe in the established markets like the U.K., Sweden, Finland and we're growing in the East, in Eastern Europe, of course, in Russia, but also in other developing areas like Poland and in Turkey. And the gains we've seen are across business segments from big-ticket undercar equipment to industrial customers to SNA Europe's.", "But the overall growth in that region was somewhat muted by the ongoing economic weakness in Southern Europe. You might remember that for Snap-on, these are large markets by way of SNA Europe, and we're not seeing relief. Countries across the south like Spain and Portugal remain weak. But you know that's no real surprise, given the almost daily news from that region. Actually, when it comes to Europe, given the turbulence, we feel okay about no major changes for us at Europe over the past few quarters. Speaking of headwinds, another that we mentioned last quarter is Japan. The situation there is fairly well known, it's unsettled as we thought it would be for a while. The good news is it's isolated and most people believe it's temporary.", "Now for the operating segment. For the operating segments and a view on the advancements we've made in those strategic areas, which we've identified as decisive for our future: expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage.", "In Commercial-Industrial or the C&I group, sales were up 8.1% from 2010 levels. However, excluding the benefit from foreign exchange, volumes increased about 2%. The operating margin was 10.4%, up 50 basis points from last year. And as you expect from the geographic discussion I just provided, most areas here were up solidly, widespread double-digit rises. Keep in mind, however, that C&I is where we see most of the impact of those fairly specific headwinds of Southern Europe, the unsettled situation in Japan, and the lower military spending which we discussed last quarter. So the story in C&I is robust gains in most areas, partially offset by the concentration of our external headwinds in this one segment.", "C&I operations outside those concentrated headwinds grew organically as double digits, very much in line with the gains in the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems and Information Groups. From that perspective, we're encouraged by the progress along run rates from growth in C&I. And that progress can be seen in the volumes, the positive motion in Asia Pacific and in critical industries such as aerospace and natural resources. All these continued with their trend of strong double-digit growth.", "But more important than the sales in a particular quarter, we know that Snap-on is building expanded long-term presence in each of those strategic areas. Just last month, the corporation had a strong showing at the Paris Air Show. It is widely recognized as the most prestigious aircraft exposition in the world, and many of you know that our array of products for the aerospace sector is expanding.", "While in Paris, we highlighted the high-tech Automated Tool Control unit or ATC and our newly increased range of torque products aimed at aerospace. And the response was very enthusiastic. It's that kind of growing presence that's generating the big gains we're seeing in this critical industry of aerospace. And the gains are being driven by customers throughout the industries from airlines in support of their fleet, to aircraft manufacturing facilities and into the maintenance and repair of overhaul shops or MRO facilities. And as you would expect, the opportunities here are across the globe, and Snap-on is increasingly valued in this important sector. We feel encouraged by that.", "I've spoken in the past about the partnerships with technical schools in creating certification programs. We believe it's a great way for technicians of the future using Snap-on products. It's a great way to get the technicians of the future to use Snap-on products, to get them to see the quality and the professionalism of the Snap-on brand and ultimately for them to become Snap-on customers for life. We continue to build those programs in the U.S. and internationally and across the wide range of disciplines from automotive repair, to critical power generation, to aerospace.", "And as part of that progress, an array of key technical schools across the U.S. have adopted Snap-on certification protocols, and that practice is expanding. Our sales in Education were up over 20% again in the quarter. But more importantly, we believe those gains are setting the stage for future growth across all the critical industries.", "I already mentioned the rapid growth we're seeing in Asia-Pacific, but I'll just provide one example of the products that are helping to drive that expansion. During the quarter, we released a new version of our diagnostics unit in China. The handheld includes a new touch screen interactive display, as well as expanded vehicle and system coverage. As you can imagine in China, with relatively recent development of the new car market, the repair wave is just starting to form. Our handheld unit is getting great reviews and is positioning Snap-on to ride that wave as it breaks. So that gives you a little insight into C&I, continued advancements in critical industries in emerging markets, significant gains, with offsets from a few concentrated headwinds in that segment.", "Moving to the Tools Group, where we serve professional automotive technicians. Sales were up 13%, including 3 points related to currency, and the operating margin was 15.5%, up 300 basis points from last year. Sales of diagnostics products to the vans were up strongly. We're continuing to see the benefits of the successful launches of both our high-end VERDICT and our updated VERUS handheld unit. Those products are innovative, big-time productivity enhancers and they're driving a big-ticket strength across the Tools Group. We said we need to maintain and even enhance our van network. It's been a big focus for us, and it's showing in the results.", "Again this quarter, the franchisee health metrics are moving positively. Obviously, the sales are up, but our franchisees are in better overall financial shape, the turnover is low, and we believe that the network is stronger than ever. We did get some validation of that progress in the quarter when Franchise Direct published its annual global franchisees report. The Snap-on franchisee proposition ranked sixth overall, the top-ranked tool company by a wide margin, in fact, the top-ranked industrial company of any type.", "This is a publication that's a leading source of information for the franchise industry in both North America and Europe, so it was a valuable endorsement for us. The rankings were based on several criteria, including stability, growth, best practices and support and training, and those are areas that all have directly benefited from our focused efforts to enhance the channel and from the application of Snap-on value creation processes.", "Now on to the Repair System & Information Group. This is where we serve vehicle repair shop owners and managers and where we have a great opportunity to expand the Snap-on brand throughout the garage. RS&I posted a sales increase of 13.9%, just under 10% excluding currency. And the operating margin, it was 20.9%, a 150 basis points up from 19.4% last year. Related to the growth in those shops, our Equipment division was up in both North America and in Europe. Over the past several years, we've had done a number of innovative products and equipment, and they're propelling us forward. The OEMs increasingly are directly signing on to these products, and that additional exposure is a big plus. Particularly strong in the quarter were big-ticket alignment products, up more than double the group's growth rate. This is a product where we have a lead in imaging technology, and we're taking advantage.", "Also related to our expansion in the garage, we're increasingly seeing -- serving medium and heavy truck market with information and diagnostics. We have launched the new Pocket iQ handheld diagnostic unit, specifically for the Truck segment. It's designed for anyone diagnosing and repairing trucks from dealers, to fleet maintenance shops even to owners. We're also working with truck engine OEMs, launching software for diagnostic testing for repair information and for reprogramming capabilities, to ease repair work across their entire line of OEM engines.", "And in the independent repair sector, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 has been making investments in truck repair and information for some time. Now we're well-positioned and we're gaining in the truck software space.", "We've spoken in the past about a relatively small direct exposure to automotive OEMs. But obviously, as the rooftops in the U.S. decrease, our Electronic Parts Catalog business to Snap-on Business Solutions has been impacted. But we're finding offsets both internationally and in adjacent markets, areas like motorcycles and agriculture, and we have made gains in those areas. Also related to this space, we continue to see increased activity in essential tool distributions. The OEMs are more freely commending, and that's helping drive some of the sales increases in RS&I. So that gives you a picture of what's going on in the operating units.", "As I said in the beginning of my remarks here, the Snap-on value creation processes are driving our progress, customer connection, building relationship with students, creating customers for life, innovation, new diagnostics units in the U.S. and the U.K. and in China for cars and for trucks. Undercar, new undercar equipment, building on technology leadership winning new customers and products expanded to serve critical industries, automated tool control and wider torque offerings. And of course, rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, one of our biggest value creators. The operating income margin tells that story, 13.6% before Financial Services, up 140 basis points stronger than we've been in some time.", "We believe we've come out of the downturn as a stronger company than when we entered, and the Snap-on value creation processes made it possible. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for our financial review. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Overall revenue growth increased profitability in Financial Services and what we believe are ongoing benefits from our Snap-on value creation processes generated a 44% improvement in year-over-year operating earnings.", "This operating earnings improvement excludes the $18 million arbitration settlement gain recorded during the quarter. That sales in the second quarter of $726.7 million increased $79.1 million by 12.2% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 7.2%. We continue to realize year-over-year sales growth broadly across most of our businesses, including increased sales to franchisees by the Snap-on Tools Group, higher sales to repair shop owners and managers by the Repair Systems & Information Group our RS&I and increased sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and critical industries that are commercial and industrial or C&I Group.", "Consolidated gross profit of $342 million in the quarter increased $38.4% million from 2010 level. As a result of higher sales, $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from ongoing RCI and restructuring initiatives of $1.9 million of lower structuring costs. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% in the quarter improved 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $243.4 million increased $18.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume related in other expenses, including a $4.2 million of anticipated higher pension expense.", "As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 33.5%, it improved 120 basis points from 34.7% last year, restructuring cost of $1.9 million in the quarter compared to $3.1 million last year. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $17.5 million before the arbitration settlement, improved to $15.8 million from second quarter 2010 levels. Sequentially and as expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to improve as our on-book financial portfolio grows.", "Interest expense of $16.3 million in the quarter increased $3.1 million from 2010 levels, mainly due to higher average debt levels following last December's $250 million notes issuance. Next month, we intend to repay $200 million of 6.25% notes upon the maturity with available cash.", "Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 34% was higher than last year's 31.2% rate, primarily due to the mix of earnings including the impact of the arbitration settlement gain that is taxable in the United States.", "And finally, reported net earnings in the second quarter of 2011 were $78 million or $1.33 per diluted share. Absent of settlement gain, which contributed $0.19 per share, net earnings in the quarter were $66.9 million or $1.14 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 47.7% when compared with the $45.3 million or $0.78 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of last year.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with a C&I Group on Slide 7, sales of $279.7 million for the second quarter improved 8.1% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 1.9%. Sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets in critical industries were up considerably in the quarter. However, the rate of year-over-year organic sales growth in the C&I group was again affected by lower sales to the Military, continued weakness across Southern Europe and some impact in Japan from last quarter's natural disasters.", "Gross profit of $102.4 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million or 10.6% from 2010 levels, primarily due to the higher sales of lower restructuring costs, $4.2 million of favorable currency effects and $2.8 million of savings from an ongoing restructuring of ongoing RCI initiatives, partially offset by inflationary in other cost increases.", "Gross margin of 36.6% in the quarter improved 80 basis points from 35.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter increased $6.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, higher volume-related expenses and higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter were 26.2% as compared to 25.9% last year. Second quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment increased $3.7 million or 14.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin in the C&I segment of 10.4% improved 50 basis points from 9.9% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group increased 13% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S, On an organic basis, sales were up 10%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $132.4 million in the quarter increased $17 million from last year's levels, primarily due to the higher sales led by increased sales of hand tools and diagnostic products and favorable currency effects. These gross profit increases were partially offset by higher structuring costs for the previously communicated consolidation of our North American tools storage operations. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.3% improved 60 basis points from 43.7% last year.", "Operating expenses of $86.2 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses and $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense.", "As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 240 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings for Snap-on Tools Group of $46.2 million in the quarter increased $13.2 million or 40% from the $33 million earned last year. And as a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 15.5% increased 300 basis points from 12.5% last year.", "Turning now to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $234.5 million increased 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 9.7% reflecting continued higher sales to repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $107.4 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from prior-year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $3 million of favorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.8 declined 70 basis points from 2010 levels, reflecting the higher relative growth in sales of undercar equipment and essential tool and facilitation program. Operating expenses of $58.4 million in the quarter increased $2.7 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.9% improved 220 basis points from 27.1% last year. Our operating expenses as a percentage of sales also benefits from the higher mix of undercar equipment and essential tool facilitation program sales, which tend to exhibit lower operating expense levels relative to the other businesses within RS&I. Operating earnings of $49 million for the RS&I group increased $9 million or 22.5% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.9% improved 150 basis points from 2010.", "Now, turning to Slide 10. Financial Services operating earnings of $35.5 million in the quarter of 2011 includes the previously discussed $18 million arbitration settlement gain. Excluding the settlement gain, operating earnings of $17.5 million in the quarter compares favorably to both first quarter earnings of $12.5 million and to fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $9.4 million. The $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings from $1.7 million last year to $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2011, we believe is testament to the earnings potential of our growing on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $153.1 million in the quarter increased 12% compared to last year's levels, reflecting increased sales in Snap-on tools, higher approval rates, as well as increased participation in our credit programs.", "Moving to Slide 11. As of the second quarter end, our balance sheet includes $845 million of gross financing receivables including $697 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the United States, $576 million or 83% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our global on-book financing portfolio has grown over $110 million. In the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $45 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now, turning to Slide 12. Net cash used by operating activities was $13.7 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $55.5 million in the second quarter of last year. This $69 million year-over-year net decrease primarily reflects the return of $89.8 million of cash previously withheld from CIT related to the arbitration settlement. This return of cash, combined with the funding of higher inventory levels and new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, were partially offset by higher net earnings. Similarly, our quarter-end cash position of $418 million decreased $154 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, the return of cash to CIT and increased levels of working investment in capital expenditures, partially offset by higher levels of net earnings in 2011.", "Free cash flow from Financial Services was, as expected, a negative $116 million, primarily due to the return of cash to CIT and the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $82 million. Capital expenditures totaled $14.7 million in the quarter.", "As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at both first quarter and 2010 year end. Inventories increased $63 million from year end, primarily to support increased customer demand and to mitigate supply-chain disruption from both the recent natural disasters in Japan and the consolidation of our North American tool storage operations.", "Currency translation also contributed $12.9 million of the inventory increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.3x compared to 4.4x at the end of Q1 and 4.7x at 2010 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Our net debt-to-capital ratio 32.4% compares to the 30.1% at 2010 year end and 28.3% last year. The year-over-year increase is primarily reflective of last December's $250 million bond issuance.", "In addition to our $418 million of cash and cash flow from operations, we have more than $600 million in available credit facilities, and our current A2P2 short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets, should we choose to do so. As of second quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This includes my remarks on our second quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. These are interesting times, but we believe Snap-on's performance confirms the underlying strength of our businesses and the ongoing potential of our runways. We're quite encouraged by the results. Sales up nicely, Opco [ph] OI margin at a relative high, meeting headwinds and overcoming. Financial Services continuing to fulfill the promise of profitability that we believed in from the original acquisition, now 2 years ago. Snap-on's potential is unfolding, just the way we've been describing for some time. The Snap-on value creation processes are driving improvements. Margins are up again. Opco [ph] by 140 basis point and the overall company by 320 basis points.", "And again this quarter, we're demonstrating progress along our strategic runways for coherent growth. The van network has been enhanced. Cash collections are up, turnovers down and Snap-on was named the top industrial franchise by Franchise Direct. We had expanded in the repair garage. Our liner sales continue their upward trend, and our big-ticket diagnostics are increasing their penetration. The Snap-on presence is expanding further in critical industries. Sales continue to grow significantly in sectors like aerospace and natural resources, and our presence in emerging markets keeps building. Our growth in China, India and Indonesia confirm the opportunities. So that's our quarter, more evidence that Snap-on has considerable strength, capabilities and position. It has much more runway for growth and improvement, and as it embarked firmly on the path that we believe will continue our progress for some time to come.", "I once again want to end my remarks -- I want to end today by speaking to the many franchisees and Snap-on associates that I know are on the call. All of what we discussed today, the encouraging results, the strategic progress would not have been possible without your commitment and your contribution. For all that you do, for all that you have done for Snap-on and our team, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Lucas of Janney Capital Markets.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I wanted to focus first on the Tool side of the business. You talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about the improved franchise metrics, citing some things such as turnover, in particular. And I was wondering if could give us a little more granularity on turnover metrics, number of vans today with the comment of the franchises being stronger than ever, and just any additional color you could provide in terms of helping us better understand the point [indiscernible].", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure, the turnover's at a relative low, I think. We've been tracking it back. I can't say it's at an all-time low, because we don't have the statistics at our hand, that's way back 20 or 25 years. But in recent history, it's at an all-time low, now down below I would say 10%. So we find that to be pretty good for us, and that's quite manageable. One of the problems with turnover is it could become very expensive. But at this level, we have the ability to manage it quite well. The way we see this is that we've invested all through the recession and try to help our franchisees in terms of continuous improvement, the productivity on their van, in terms of upgrading their system and in terms of giving them access to other opportunities like more efficient ways to ensure they're advanced, more efficient ways to communicate more, better ways to manage their vans from a fuel consumption point of view. And we see all that coming through in these numbers. Now in terms of the van side, I think the numbers are somewhere just south of 3,500. That's been growing gradually. I want to say on a year-over-year basis, single digits. So it's been moving upwards but not at a large pace, but it's been very stable.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And with regards to the 15% margin in tools, I mean, is the phenomenal number we've been waiting a long, long time to see the potential of getting unlocked and that's very gratifying to see. When you look at the margin profile of tools today, where is the potential for that? And I guess secondary to that question is, what impact did mix have on margins this quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Let me speak of that in a couple of ways. The first thing is, if you're thinking about the short term and you want to extrapolate off of this, I think what have to think of for Snap-on, of course, for the Tools Group and for our business, in general, is the second quarter is a good strong quarter for us. The third quarter is always uncertain. We have in the Tools Group the van drivers will take time off. They have to go on vacation sometimes. They usually go on the third quarter, and we put the Snap-on Franchisee Conference in that period. So if you're looking at the short term, I don't think you can extrapolate from second quarter onto the third quarter. You have to get that effect in the Tools Group, and you have the effect in Europe of vacations which are always, in my experience, of indeterminate length depending on the year in Europe. So you have in the short term. In the longer term, we feel very positive about our position in the Tools Group. I don't know if you can extrapolate off the 15.5%. In the past, we have said that our target for operating margins for the entire corporation is around mid-teens, and we thought the Tools Group would approach that. In this second quarter, it got above that number. It started to go into the back end, the back half of that number. I don't know what you can make out of one quarter. But having said that, we feel very good about where the Tools business is today. That's not being driven by necessarily an extraordinarily rich mix of the business. It's simply being driven by RCI, by good strong sales, by our ability to price against inflation, which we said before, and a combination of those things. And together with, I suppose, you could say robust sales of big-ticket items like diagnostics and tool storage. So I think you could look at the Tools Group second quarter and say, \"Wow, that is an extraordinary quarter. They have been selling on -- they are operating on all cylinders. They probably have gained some share, if you look at their growth in this situation. They've got good growth, and they're performing well and the mix is very robust.\u201d I don't know if you can extrapolate from that number.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "And then finally, on C&I, you've got the ongoing headwind that persist out there, and a lot investments that have been made and with the core growth in the quarter shows that those investments clearly are paying off. But as we look out to the second half of the year and when you start thinking about budgeting next year, how are you thinking about those headwinds persisting and the ability to potentially accelerate the growth rate within C&I, given all of those other opportunities outside of the headwinds?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure. If you take away, as I said in my call, if you take away the headwinds in those concentrated areas, C&I grew just like we always believed it would, double digits. But let's talk about the headwinds. Look, Japan is going to fix itself. I was just there about 4 weeks ago myself, and it is still having trouble associated with rolling power cuts and so-and-so. But that will all work itself out, as we know the Japanese do, they're very ingenious and so on and so. We think Japan comes back from its current malaise, I don't know it will go back to prerecession levels or not, but you'll certainly see recovery. So I think that fixes itself out toward the back of the year. If you're talking about the military, I don't know where the government goes, but the comparisons get easier year-over-year. So when you're talking about a growth scenario that looks like we have managed over, at least, through this quarter, maybe another quarter, the worst of that, and we'll start building from a base. I have given up predicting Spain. Because I think, I would have said a year ago that Spain's got to get better. We believe we're not losing market share, but the Spanish market was down again, and I think what you're seeing is, if you just pick up a newspaper and read about it, you can see the roots of that across Southern Europe. And so, that's how I see C&I. Good strong double-digit growth happening just like we thought it would. Three concentrated areas of headwinds, 2 of which we think dissipate as we go through the year in the third and fourth quarter, varying time constants. And Spain, I'm not so sure. We're confident it's going to come back, but I can't predict the timing.", "Operator", "And we'll now move on to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "A couple of questions on the Financial Services portfolio. When do you think that sit receivables will totally we run off by, Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think that you'll see the balance of that portfolio. It runs often but at ever-slowing pace, Gary, because the most vibrant of accounts have already come over. But in year 2012 is when I think we've been looking to say we will be at our future state. There will be very little noise from the CIT old portfolio.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "So there'll be little impact in 2012?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think so.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay, and then in terms of either balance sheet capacity or where you want to take this, where do you think this portfolio goes in a year and a half? I mean can you, overall, be managing a portfolio of close to $1 billion?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think so. I think we've already spoken about a portfolio size of around $925 million. It will largely reflect the growth in the Tools Storage business. That's largely what their financing is, sales to mechanics in those markets where the Tools Group serves. So it will be that order of magnitude.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then in terms of what you guys do on new products, you often say that you put out about 40 new products a year that generate over $1 million per product. Are you on track to do that this year as well?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure. We sought some of it. We tried to give some color of that in my remarks, and we're seeing that. If you could see the new products we're going to roll out at the Snap-on Franchisee Conference, I think you would be excited. I was excited when I viewed some of them, and it's across the line. We see them in industrial, aimed at critical industry, some new stuff that excites people in critical industries. We see new products in power tools and torque and tools storage and hand tools and diagnostics, and it will all be rolling out as we go through the year. So if anything, it's getting stronger. I think we feel better about that, and part of the reason why we had this good quarter, I think, is because we've been driven by a new product.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then in terms of the emerging markets, can you give us any idea of what percentage of your sales are coming from there now versus where they were last year at this time? Or is that something you just don't disclose as of yet?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We generally don't disclose it. I can tell you it's between 5% and 10%, and it's increasing every year between last year. That's generally what we've kind of held to and I think we'll stay there, but it's growing. It's 5% and 10%, growing greater than GDP, greater than the rest of the company on a base that's smaller. But still, pretty nice growth for us when you look at it on the margin.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "And is it safe to assume that the majority of those sales are in China or is it split evenly between China and India?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well the biggest piece is China, but we get -- this month, we get good growth out of it in India. And actually, this month we tried to highlight that Indonesia is becoming a bigger market for us. I think that's the underappreciated growth engine in Asia-Pacific. Having lived there for 11 years myself, I know that for a long time, Indonesia malingered in political promise but I think they solved some of it. A couple of years ago they had a currency problem, but now they seem to be hitting, as I said before on other things, hitting on all cylinders. So we're pretty positive about our position here and have a good position in Indonesia. So that was a contributor this quarter for us and we look to it to be a contributor going forward.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And we'll move on to our next question from Jared Platts [ph] with Robert Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Actually, it's David Leiker. Nick, 2 things. On C&I first, I just want to -- I missed some of your comments earlier, I just want to confirm the comment I heard earlier. Are you saying that your C&I business, excluding Southern Europe, Military and Japan is running double-digits?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, that's what I said.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And is that consistent with what we would have seen in the first quarter, where the segment as a whole had organic growth of 8% or 9%?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, it's pretty much like that. I think we're not seeing any -- the question is, are we seeing any back-offs in the industrial area or the critical industry areas? We are not seeing anything like that. I know there's a lot of discussion about industrial back-and-forth in a number of different sectors, particularly over the last few days. We like our Industrial business. And now, we have a specialized industrial business. First, we're armed with the Snap-on brand, with all these guys and all these professionals in the industry loved and revere. And secondly, we're aiming just at the critical. We're just not so easy to back off of when you need the results, because the need for repeatability and reliability is important. So I think we're in a great spot in the industrial sector.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes, I agree. I think that's fantastic. So if we look at this move from this 8% to 9% with 2% organic growth, it would seem that most, if not all, of that is a function of Military and Japan, is that fair?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Actually, Spain was down, too. Spain was down.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Spain has gotten worse?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Spain got worse. I almost want to say, \"Shut my mouth.\" I was surprised by that because we -- that's why I've given up predicting Spain. Although we don't think -- our customers are still buying, it's just small amounts. We don't think we lost share.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then on the other side, if we look at what Stanley Black & Decker reported yesterday or 2 days ago, it looks like there's some volume gains that are going on there. I know it's hard to tell how much of it, because the revenue numbers we see are from the corporate to the dealer, and not the dealer to the street, do you have any sense with their change in ownership and direction there? Is Mac being run better? Or they have a better presence in the market? Do they have a better value proposition? Can you just talk about what's going on in that regard?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I will let others opine on how Mac is being run. I have a lot of respect for the Stanley management myself, but I don't know what's actually -- we're not seeing any change at the -- where the rubber meets the road at the customer base, second quarter, versus first quarter. If anything, we thought our -- we think our competitive position is fairly robust. I would offer that, Gee, I think double-digit growth, 10% in the Tools Group, that's got to be pretty strong. I don't think we're losing out or losing position to anybody in that situation. I even think we're getting stronger. Our people feel we're getting stronger. I was with 1,200 customers at Joliet, Illinois at the, National Drag Racing Championships about 10 days ago. And when I talked to our franchisees, they were quite enthusiastic and quite full of themselves in terms of confidence. So if the numbers, if the anecdotal evidence is anything, I feel we're, if anything, stronger than ever. And if the metrics are anything, I think 10% indicates that we're growing. And by the way, the comparison wasn't that easy. If you look at the Tools Group, they were pretty strong last year in the second quarter. So at 10% growth year-over-year, it's not small. It's fairly significant. I can't explain necessarily the Stanley numbers. And again, if you have questions about your selling into the van, and I'm not exactly sure what's in those numbers.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "What did you see in your -- in terms of end market demand, yout dealer sales, how did those track relative at the corporate level?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Pretty much in lockstep with our corporate levels. If the question is are we building inventories on the vans? I don't believe so. We're not building inventories on the vans. So generally, we see this as just a reflective of the marketplace. I think what you're seeing in the van channel is, is good robust product. We have some nice, nice products out there that's engaging the customers. And I say that you can't dismiss the fact that our franchisees are, we believe, stronger than ever before. We feel better about our franchisee population than we ever have in the past. By the way, Franchise Direct kind of said something like that. We were 6 and no tool manufacturer was even close and no industrial franchiser is even close. We felt good about it.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Mrs. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Well, thanks everyone for joining us today.

Ms. Kratcoski, please go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Rufus, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter 2011 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. ", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website, next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call, relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information on the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I\u2019ll now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, I would characterize our third quarter as an extension of the broad progress we\u2019ve been making for quite some time. And I would say that the continuing trend is especially encouraging in light of the generally negative macroeconomic news we seem to be hearing almost every day. Overall, our sales in the quarter were up 6.8%. Excluding currency, organic volumes increased 3.6%. Now last year's third quarter did create some tough year-over-year optics, because we were in the midst of a fairly robust recovery, and there really wasn't any of the normal 5% seasonal sequential decline we usually see in the third quarter. ", "From that perspective, this year's sequential downtick of 3.5% was a bit better then usual. So this period's volume is a positive indicator. Operating income for the quarter rose by over 37%, and our operating margin of 15.8% was up from 12.5% last year. Now those numbers include $15.8 million in higher earnings from Financial Services, and that's the result of the continuing ramp up of our on-book portfolio. ", "Looking at the results before Financial Services. The third quarter operating margin of 13.5% was up 140 basis points, in part aided by that favorable mark-to-market adjustments highlighted in our release. But even excluding those adjustments, Opco operating income in the period represents a new record high for a Snap-on third quarter. ", "We believe the advancements we're making are a great testimony to the effectiveness of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we apply every day in moving the company forward: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. It's that framework that enables our progress and it's driving our strong profitability. ", "As usual, I'll now review some of the highlights for the quarter, provide my perspective on the market environment and offer a view on the strategic areas we've identified as being decisive for our future, extending to critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the garage.", "Regarding the overall environment, I'll just comment that based on our various businesses, it can be characterized as generally unchanged from the past several quarters. I view that as a real positive, because if you pick up the paper or watch the news on any given day, you'll get the feeling that there's been a decided turn for the worst, but we're just not seen it. That said, I do think the well-documented troubles in Europe are creating a bit more uncertainty, and therefore, less visibility. But we\u2019ve had a high level of European uncertainty as well as a headwind in Southern Europe for quite a while, and we've managed through it by taking advantage in other places where opportunities are expanding like in emerging markets and in critical industries and in automotive repair. So there is some uncertainty as there has been for some time. But we're not seeing any overriding downturn. ", "Probably the best summary measure I can give you is this. In the third quarter, our volumes, excluding the effect of currency movements, were above the third quarter levels of both 2007 and 2008, the strongest period before the recession took hold. That same comparison for the first 2 quarters of this year showed 2011 slightly below those earlier year levels. So if recapture of pre-recession level is your measure of recovery momentum, our third quarter was another favorable data point, and it occurred despite the bad news all over the press.", "Moving to the highlights of the operating segments. The Commercial & Industrial Group sales increased 6.6%, that's 2.6% organic growth excluding currency. The operating margin was 10.6%, a 20 basis point improvement from the second quarter, but down from the 11.7% last year, reflecting the concentration of our major headwinds in this segment, the weakness in Southern Europe as well as contracted military spending. These challenges primarily impact the C&I Group where SNA Europe has a strong position in Spain and Portugal and where our Industrial division has felt the impact of the reduced military spending. ", "In the balance of the C&I Group, outside of those specific areas, volumes were actually up much more robustly, about 8% organically. Those gains reflect the progress being made in our primary areas of C&I strategic focus, building our presence in emerging markets and extending into critical industries. ", "Speaking of emerging markets, the gains continue to be far in excess of any related GDP growth rate, and the expansion isn't just limited to Asia. We\u2019re posting significant gains in the emerging European regions. Places like Russia and Turkey are growing rapidly. So I guess, when you say emerging markets, the focus is most of on Asia; the discussion is Asia. And we did see exceptionally strong gains across that region as well, in places like India, in Indonesia, and, of course, in China. We're investing continuously in the region and it's paying off with growing position. ", "In that regard, our Asian product offering is expanding. Our Undercar Equipment lineup, aligners in particular has been ramping up and rolling out over the past few quarters. And as you would expect this is a product that is specifically designed for Asia, and coupled with our new Asian Diagnostic Products, which I discussed last quarter, we're not only driving growth in the region but we're building a strong presence as the repair wave is just rising in China. We said all along that we'll continue to invest in those areas that are strategically important. And we're doing just that in China. We're in the process of building a new engineering and R&D center in that country. It will be state-of-the-art. It will support a wide range of Asianized product and it\u2019ll help continue our rapid growth all over the region. In addition to emerging markets, we're also building our position in critical industries. Our Aviation & Aerospace sales, served through our Industrial division, grew strongly in the quarter. I've spoken about our ever-expanding offering for those customers, while we're highlighting that broadened array of products with what we call our Advanced Technology Labs. These are large trucks, loaded with aviation offering, trav -- with our aviation offering, traveling site to site to assembly plants, to hangars and to maintenance and repair and overhaul locations. We find it to be a great way to demonstrate the product right in the workplace and it's helping drive our growth. Every month, we're getting orders from new customers for tool control systems and toolkits, for flight lines, for assembly operations and for those MRO facilities. Importantly, as you would expect, our position is improving across the globe here. Aviation is an industry that is growing internationally. It's certainly critical and it's right in the Snap-on wheelhouse. ", "On to the Tools Group where sales were up 8.1%, including about 2 points from currency. The operating margin of 12.7% was an increase of 180 basis points from last year. The Tools Group is where we serve professional automotive technicians and they value Snap-on. That fact was recently highlighted, once again, by -- as we came out on top in Frost & Sullivan\u2019s survey of technicians\u2019 brand preferences in hand tools, diagnostics, tools storage, power tools and pneumatic air tools. We always distance ourselves from the competition by wide margins in this survey, but this year's results showed Snap-on even further in the lead with record levels of professional technicians choosing Snap-on in several of those categories. For example, in hand tools, 75% of technicians surveyed preferred Snap-on. ", "The next highest brand registered only 8%. Now with that sort of position, it's no wonder that our franchise network is strong. Volumes in the third quarter for our franchisees were very robust. And the franchisee-held metrics, which we closely monitored, continued their favorable trend. ", "The Snap-on Franchisee Conference, which was held in August, provided more evidence of progress in strengthening our franchise system, another one of our primary strategic objectives, strengthening that system. This conference was quite a success, record participation and higher than ever product ordering activity. And aside from the metrics and the sales levels, the enthusiasm, the enthusiasm on display was considerable and contagious. All of this is testimony that our network is well positioned and moving in the right direction.", "Now for the Repair System Information segment or the RS&I Group. Sales were up 7.3% or 4.7% without the favorable effect of currency. The gains were somewhat muted by the return to a more typical seasonal decline in our Undercar Equipment business, which had been particularly strong in the third quarter of 2010. The RS&I operating margin of 19.6% remained very strong, but was down from last year's level of, I think, 20.1%, mainly due to growth in our Facilitation business that serves OEM dealerships. That lower margin activity was up strongly as OEMs continue to commit to additional essential tools in diagnostic programs throughout the U.S. and in Europe. One of the highlights in RS&I for the third quarter was the launch of our SOLUS Ultra, a new full-function handheld diagnostic unit. We introduced it at the August Franchisee Conference and it made a big splash. It offers some real advancements, ease-of-use, functionality, starting with the faster boot-up and a battery that charged directly from the vehicle so never any worries about power availability. It also had a keyless adapter that makes connections to the vehicle much easier. And it has high-resolution graphing on a touch screen that is 50% larger than the competition. This tool is always ready to be used with improved simplicity and productivity and it\u2019s helping support the strong results in RS&I. ", "I mentioned earlier that the Equipment division returned to its normal seasonality in the third quarter, and that counterization is driven by the fact that Snap-on has a strong position in the European equipment market where summers, they tend to be a bit slower. Our Undercar Equipment lineup in fact is where we're seeing some strong international expansion. I already mentioned the liners in my discussion of Asian growth, but we're seeing the same kind of thing in Brazil and in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe. We're posting solid gains in those areas. Our equipment lineup is instrumental in advancing us along 2 of our strategic runways, expanding in the garage and building in emerging markets with leading technologies that does provide a real advantage. An example of one recent new product in this area, just being launched in Europe, is our new RFV 2000 diagnostic wheel balancer. It\u2019s already getting considerable attention and winning innovation awards right out of the blocks. We've taken our patented imaging technology to analyze the interaction between the wheel and the suspension system so this new unit predicts and will head off any vibrations, all in just a few spins of the wheel, achieving a balance quicker than ever before. ", "The RFV 2000 also laser maps the side wall and the wheel and the tire tread providing a picture of the actual and predicted tire wear, heading off any future problems. That's a feature that's going to be valued by shop owners everywhere when they\u2019re dealing with car owners. ", "So that's some of the highlights in each of the operating units, and while I just mentioned some of the new products in the RS&I Group, let me expand that discussion a bit as it relates to the entire corporation and to the Snap-on value creation processes. Two of the tenets embedded in this framework are innovation and customer connection. We have a great legacy in both those areas. And we believe a huge advantage in the number of customer interactions that our people, whether they're franchisees or associates, have with professional users, those who actually benefit from our productivity enhancing tools, that customer connection gives us great insight for developing new products. So not only do professionals prefer Snap-on as evidenced by the survey data, but we're using that strong customer connection to make sure our product line just keeps getting better with new innovative offerings that customers greatly value. ", "Just recently, we were honored to have won 2 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Award. These awards recognize products that will help make the jobs of technicians and shop owners easier, enabling them to perform vehicle repair more accurately and more quickly. One of the winning products was the RFV 2000 that I already mentioned. The other was the VERDICT diagnostic and information systems, a modular handheld unit that includes a touch screen and wirelessly connects to the vehicle. It also includes Wi-Fi access and Windows multitasking so that technicians can access more information, including our Mitchell 1 shop key repair information system, and they can do it from anywhere in the garage. I've spoken about this product in the past and I think at that time, I told you it was great innovation. Well, this award confirms that fact. As further testimony to the effectiveness of customer connection and our innovation processes, Snap-on was also named winner of 4 innovation awards by Professional Tool & Equipment News. Our products were voted the best in tool storage, the best in lifts, the best in shop equipment and the best in tool accessories. The importance of this recognition is that the judges are professionals, people that make their living using these very products, independent shop owners and skilled technicians. In that regard, these awards speak strongly not only to Snap-on product innovations, but to our strong connection to our customers. It's a unique Snap-on advantage, and it's paying dividends. ", "So that's our third quarter: Encouraging financials, clear evidence of strategic progress and a strong pipeline full of new and exciting products. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a more detailed -- more detail on the financials. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the third quarter of $697.2 million increased $44.1 million or 6.8% year-over-year. Excluding favorable currency translation of $19.6 million, organic sales increased 3.6% as we realized year-over-year sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Continued sales increases in the Snap-on Tools Group, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to OEM dealerships, expansion in emerging markets and growth to a wide range of customers in critical industries, more than offset anticipated lower sales for the military and across Southern Europe. As Nick also noted, these sales levels reflect a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern where we typically experience lower sequential sales moving from the second quarter to the third quarter. This seasonal pattern was largely absent in 2010 as the economy was rebounding from 2009 recession levels. Consolidated gross profit of $329.3 million in the quarter increased $28.1 million from 2010 levels, reflecting contributions from higher sales, $9.5 million of favorable foreign currency effects, savings from our ongoing cost-reduction and rapid continuous improvement or RCI initiatives and $1 million of lower restructuring cost. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 46.1% last year. ", "Operating expenses in the quarter of $235 million increased $12.6 million from 2010 levels. The year-over-year operating expense increase includes volume-related and other costs as well as $5.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, $3.1 million of expected higher pension expense, $2.6 million of increased performance-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost. As noted in our earnings release, mark-to-market adjustments on stock-based compensation, which are calculated on the quarter ending stock price, also benefited third quarter results. The change in Snap-on's period-end stock price resulted in a benefit of $7.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter. And while we always have some impact from mark-to-market in our results, recent stock market declines resulted in the significant third quarter benefit. Similarly, should the price of Snap-on stock appreciate during a given quarter, we would incur mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses in the quarter of 33.7% improved 30 basis points from 34% last year from a restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared to $2.1 million last year. ", "Operating earnings from Financial Services of $20.8 million improved $15.8 million from third quarter 2010 levels. As expected, Financial Services operating earnings continues to grow as our on-book Finance portfolio grows. Consolidated operating earnings of $115.1 million or 15.8% of total revenues increased 330 basis points from 12.5% a year ago, with the mark-to-market contributing 110 basis points. Interest expense of $15.1 million in the quarter increased $1.6 million from 2010 levels primarily due to higher average debt levels to fund the growth in our contract portfolio of Snap-on credit, partially offset by lower average interest rates. ", "Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.7% was lower than last year's 34.4% rate, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Finally, third quarter net earnings of earnings per share of $67.8 million or $1.16 per diluted share increased $21.3 million or 45.8% from last year's levels. Even without the $0.09 of benefit from mark-to-market, these net earnings and earnings per share represent an all-time third quarter record. Now let's turn to our segment results.", "Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $278.3 million for the third quarter improved 6.6% from 2010 levels. Excluding currency translation, sales rose 2.6%. C&I benefited from double-digit gains in both Asia and Eastern Europe. These higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets as well as critical industries were partially offset by expected lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness across Southern Europe. Gross profit of $102.8 million in the quarter increased $6.6 million or 6.9% from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher sales, $2.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects and $1.2 million of a lower restructuring cost. Gross margin of 36.9% in the quarter improved slightly from 36.8% last year. Operating expenses of $73.2 million in the quarter were up $7.6 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to the volume related and other expenses, $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1.8 million of higher restructuring costs, largely for the ongoing optimization of our cost structure in Europe. ", "As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 26.3% in the quarter compared to 25.1% last year. Third quarter operating earnings of $29.6 million for this C&I segment declined $1 million from 2010 levels, largely due to overall higher restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.6% in the C&I segment compared with 11.7% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group improved $20.9 million or 8.1% year-over-year, largely due to continued higher sales in the U.S. And on an organic basis, sales were up 6%. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $125.2 million in the quarter increased $17.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher sales across several product categories, favorable manufacturing utilization and $4.8 million of favorable currency effects. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 44.8% in the Snap-on Tools Group improved 320 basis points from 41.6% last year. Operating expenses of $89.6 million in the quarter increased $10.1 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses including higher cost as a result of increased participation at the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference and $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 32.1% in the quarter compared with 30.7% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $35.6 million in the quarter increased $7.4 million or 26.2% from the $28.2 million earned last year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 12.7% in the quarter increased 180 basis points from 10.9% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group as shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222.6 million increased 7.3% year-over-year. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 4.7%, primarily due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs. Gross profit of $101.3 million in the quarter increased $4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to higher sales and $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 140 basis points from 2010 levels, largely reflecting the growth in essential tool facilities and program sales to OEM dealerships which yield relatively lower gross margins. Operating expenses of $57.6 million in the quarter increased $2 million from 2010 levels, primarily due to $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.9% improved 90 basis points from 26.8% last year. Operating earnings of $43.7 million for the RS&I Group increased $2 million or 4.8% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 19.6% compared to 20.1% last year.", "Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $20.8 million on revenue of $32.7 million. This compares with operating earnings of $5 million or $17.2 million of revenue last year. We believe the $15.8 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings demonstrates the earnings potential of our growing on-book Finance portfolio. Originations of $153 million in the quarter rose 7.2% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. ", "Moving to Slide 11. As of third quarter end, our balance sheet includes $896 million of gross financing receivables, including $751 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. In the U.S., $609 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2011, our on-book financing portfolio has grown over $160 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect that our on-book finance portfolio will roughly increase by an additional $20 million to $25 million. The pace of the portfolios on balance sheet development continues as expected and naturally decelerates as the transition progresses. For 2012, we would expect any further expansion of the Snap-on credit portfolio to largely reflect activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Net cash provided by operating activities was $42 million in the quarter. This compares to net cash provided of $10.2 million last year. Our quarter-end cash position of $186 million decreased $386 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the August repayment of $200 million of long-term notes, continued funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit and the previously disclosed second quarter repayment of amounts previously withheld from CIT. ", "As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $42 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. Free cash flow from the operating company was a positive $35 million. Capital expenditures totaled $13.3 million in the quarter. ", "As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at quarter end improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased $70 million from year-end levels, primarily to support higher demand and seasonal inventory builds, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and to improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.1x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year-end, reflective of the higher inventory. ", "Our net debt to capital ratio of 33.8% compares to 30.1% to 2010 year-end and 29.2% last year. The year-over-year increase results primarily from last December's $250 million bond issuance, net of this quarter's $200 million debt repayment and the second quarter repayment to CIT. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including $200 million under our recently amended loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of third quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. ", "During the quarter, Fitch initiated credit ratings on Snap-on of A- and F2, which is in addition to our existing ratings of A- and A2 from S&P and Baa1 and P2 for Moody's. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter. Sales positive from a sequential perspective. And from the vantage point of capturing pre-recession levels, the volumes represent another step forward, better than either our 2007 or our 2008 third quarter activity. From a profit view, there were adjustments that helped, but even excluding those effects, both OpCo operating income and our EPS in the period represent record high profits for a Snap-on third quarter. ", "Regarding the environment. It was a third quarter, and as I have said in the past, there is considerable variation on third quarters due to vacations. On balance, however, looking at our overall results, it appears that just the same headwinds are in place, but the positive trends are continuing despite the bad news we get every day in the press. While our results don't indicate deterioration, the difficult macros -- the difficult macroeconomic bulletins do create some limits to our forward visibility; I think that's fair to say. But having said that, I'm confident that the advantages and strengths we bring to any environment, the Snap-on value creation process generates improvement in good times and in challenging times. Our runways for growth enhancing the network, expanding in the repair garage, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, they remain attractive and they\u2019ve generated returns on our investments and on our energy for multiple quarters now. And we're fully confident they'll provide the same strong opportunities as we go forward to the days and the quarters and the years ahead. Before I finish though, I want to once again speak directly to our associates and franchisees around the world. I know many of you are listening or will replay this call later. The Snap-on third quarter was another encouraging period. And we all know that our financial and strategic progress would not be possible without your effort. So for your extraordinary contributions, for the wins you have achieved, and for your commitment to your team, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I want to start first with 2 housekeeping questions. First, on the military comparisons. When do -- when does that anniversary? So that will be the first question.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I said the last quarter, and I think that this does certainly continue, it starts to abate going into the fourth quarter. We said last time it would be about another quarter of tough comparisons, starts to get a little bit better next quarter, and, of course, gets better as we go into the first quarter. So we start to get out of the worst of it as we move forward into the next quarter.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And the other housekeeping question. With the shift in the third quarter in RS&I to -- with some more facilitation sales, understanding the seasonal weakness on the under car side, as you look to the fourth quarter, would you expect the stronger facilitation sales to continue or shift back to more equipment?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think equipment comes back in the fourth quarter. It has a stronger fourth quarter so you\u2019ll see that come back. Equipment historically has a weak third quarter. We'll see some snap back of that in the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis. I don't expect the facilitation business to back off in the fourth quarter though. So I think what you're going to see, looking forward is, as I've outlined I think, in our \u2013 as was outlined in our comments, you'll see a seasonal recovery of the Equipment business. And I think that will affect the mix in that way. OEM will stay -- the OEM facilitation business will stay about where it is.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one of the things that you historically talked about, Nick, is demand for big-ticket items. And as we got out of the seasonally slow August, end of September, entering into the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could just give us a update anecdotally what you're seeing out there in both the tools as well as the C&I side?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. We look at big ticket -- as you say, big ticket is kind of our bellwether for storms coming. And we haven't seen any back-off in the aggregate big ticket. If you're looking at that category, you're talking about tool storage units, larger equipment items and larger diagnostics. And that business has, in aggregate, been fairly strong. Now of course, it can be effective from quarter-to-quarter by product launches and shows and so on, but we feel still that we don't see any indication of downturn in that -- out of that data. In fact, our aligner business is, which is really sort of our ultimate big-ticket event is up quite strongly in this quarter.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And with regards to Europe, did you see any changes as the quarter progressed? Just wondering, I mean, I understand exactly where you're coming from. I mean, you're echoing what we're hearing from a lot of other companies and that if you don't read the headlines, things still look okay but have you seen any changes either from moderation of growth rates or anything in any specific countries or industries?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I hear you. I don't think so. Now I'll point out though that the third quarter is kind of squirrelly in Europe so if you\u2019re going to look week-by-week or month-by-month, it's very hard to interpret anything. I think I've said that kind of consistently. But as I'd step back at it and look from a macro point of view, we don't see this. In fact, just as you said, I've said this many times and I think in the last fortnight, a number of people have said the same thing to me. If we could unplug the TVs and then withdraw from the Internet, people wouldn't be talking about a downturn. I just think our businesses look okay.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And then final question from me, very big picture, each quarter we tend to ask just updates on the capital allocation side. And given credit playing out as expected, the balance sheet kind of getting where you would expect it to be, the strong cash that you're generating, could you talk a little bit about how you think of the dividend policy, buybacks as well as opportunities on the acquisition side?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure. Our ranking for use of cash, one organic growth. We have lots of places we can put it. For example, some of the build in working capital in Asia and so on and then emerging markets and investing in capital expenditures support things like our R&D center and so on. Secondly would be acquisitions around that core coherent group, making us -- allowing us to expand in the garage, extend to critical industries or build in emerging market, any of those dimensions, we'd be looking at that. And then dividends, where we feel pretty strongly that our dividends for perpetuity, because we've never \u2013 we\u2019ve paid a dividend every year since 1939 and never reduced it. So we look at moving our dividend up, but it's always in the context that we're never going to move, it's permanent for us. And then after that, we offset shares -- we offset dilution by buying back shares. So those are the orders in which we look at it.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And with regards to the dividend policy, I mean, I understand where you're coming from, but it's been some time since that\u2019s been addressed, and just trying to get an idea how often that is addressed.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I can just tell you that we look at it every quarter with the Board. And so I think you guys can draw your own conclusions in looking at our history in this kind of things. I think we moved it last November, right? So you guys can look at that and draw your own conclusions. I can only say we look at it every quarter.", "Operator", "And for our next question, we go to David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple things here. You\u2019ve touched on some of this, Nick just kind of put it all together, but as we look at the organic growth here in the quarter, slower, multiple reasons and understandable, some are tightening issues and things like that. As we look forward, do you think like a 4% or 5% organic growth is achievable over time in an economic environment that we're in today? We continue to muddle along in U.S. and Europe like we are. With the 4% to 5% organic number...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, sure. I think we've said 4% to 6%, and this is kind of in that range. I think we tried to make the point in the call that okay, this is a 3.5% percent or 3.6% growth, but actually if you look at it from the perspective of recapturing pre-recessionary levels, it's a fairly positive quarter. And so now we're back to pre-recession levels so I think you're talking about that 4% to 6% range going forward.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "But can you do that in an environment where in U.S. or Europe are growing 1% GDP or 0, negative 1?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I think we can. I mean, I think that we have share gain to add. We have places where we have not unleashed the Snap-on brand. I think that's what coherent growth is all about. We're not looking at necessarily -- we're not necessarily looking at riding economics upwards. We're looking at, if you think about what we're doing, we're talking about taking the Snap-on brand to critical industries where it's never been done -- never done before in a real serious way. We're talking about emerging markets, which are growing at faster than whatever it is, 1% or 2%. And we know there are technicians we do not call on in the Tools Group. And we could do that. So I think we feel pretty good about that. Now I want to emphasize that I've said 4% to 6% kind of an annual over time basis. I'm not saying you can do it every single quarter, but I think if you look at those numbers, capturing more technicians through the efficiency of the vans, extending out into critical industries which are places we haven't gone before, which is kind of like share capture, building in emerging markets, where the wave is still rising and getting into the garage a little bit more by offering more products. I think those places ride above the specific GDP numbers. Now if everything crashes, and we have a really terrible situation like people are talking about the banks all holding up and everybody's worrying about putting money in their mattress or something, then that's a different situation. If you just talk about slow growth, we feel okay.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then I think -- just I want to confirm something I think I heard is that, if you look at the seasonality that you saw in the revenue line here in the quarter, this is probably a pretty normal quarter adjusting for distortions last year. Is that fair?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, yes. That's right. If you look at the second quarter, this is actually a little bit better. I mean, the thing is if you look at the second quarter -- normally, we're down 5% to 6%. We're down 3.5%. And so I would say this is within windage. The third quarter there\u2019s always a lot of windage so we kind of view it as a kind of normal consequence of where we were at the second quarter.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then as we look at Q4 and into 2012, are there any particular initiatives or costs or unusual items or things like that, that we should be aware of as we look forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I don't think so. I think we're going to be -- continue where we\u2019re \u2013 well that\u2019s what I said. We're controlled restructurers so we're going to be restructuring about the same; we might move a little bit more. I think -- I've said all along that because we think times are good, we're still unloosening our belt a little bit from where we restricted costs way back in 2009. So some of that flows through our P&L from time to time, but nothing huge, I don't think. And we're just doing the same things we've said we've been doing for a while.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. One other item here. On the Stanley call yesterday, they talked about some of the initiatives that they\u2019re gaining some traction, particularly taken some of the professional tools, the DeWalt brand in particular and putting on Mac truck some things like that. Are you seeing that Mac is better run now as a distribution channel today than it was over the years? Just your thoughts on what you're seeing there.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I have a lot of respect for the Stanley management, and to the extent that they would focus on Mac, I suppose that would have a very positive effect on the running of that business. And maybe that\u2019s some of what you're seeing, but when I look at our numbers, and I talk to our people -- I was just with the NFAC or National Franchisee Advisory Council for the U.S. on one weekend and a subsequent weekend with the Canadians. They all feel pretty strongly about their position. And they're not seeing -- they're not feeling threatened by anybody else. So to the extent people are doing better, I think, maybe they're getting share someplace else; that could be part of it. I don't know. But our business, we seem to not be seeing pressure from competitive activity; if anything, we seem stronger.", "Operator", "And we go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Could you maybe help me with this issue with your stock price and the stock comp expense? Is this that you plan internally for stock comp expense relative to a certain price of the stock? And I guess what I'm getting at is in that if the stock stays where it is, through Q4, are we going to see the same kind of positive impact to the expenses?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. Look, it has to do with -- I'll try to explain it and then I'll turn it over to Aldo. I mean, I'll try to give you the people's interpretation of it, and then -- the whole idea is, it emanates from 2 big pieces. One is the fact that for outside the United States, we grant stock appreciation rights, not options. And we have deferred compensation in the United States where you have a stock certificate, not a real share, and so that gets mark-to-market based on a stock price. And so what happens is that if the stock stays at where it is today, which is up from the quarter close, we would see some kind of negative in the fourth quarter. And so any time the stock -- it's a quarter-to-quarter thing so if the stock moves up during the quarter, we will see a negative impact for this. If the stock moves down, we see a positive.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay and in doing your budgeting, you kind of roll it every quarter. I guess what I'm getting at is\u2026", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "It\u2019s beyond our control, Gary. It actually moves within the stock price itself, which obviously we can't control. So when we do our budgets and planning, you might assume a certain appreciation rate for the stock over time and that's how we would approach it. But when people have stock appreciation rights or can invest in deferred compensation programs, they have the equivalent of -- they have stock equivalents. So depending on what the price of the stock is, whether it be up or down, you get a favorable or unfavorable mark-to-market effect or impact.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "But it's pegged as of the 30th of September price then is it?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Correct. At the end of each quarter, the accounting rules require that it's the price at the close of the quarter that day, and so really you have -- all you have to do is look at the Snap-on stock price at the end of each quarter and if it's up over the previous quarter, it\u2019ll be mark-to-market expense. If it's down from the previous quarter, it will be mark-to-market benefit. Normally, we\u2019d never had this discussion because it was quite a volatile quarter as you can recall. So if you look at the Snap-on stock price, it was up in the 60s and then it was in the mid-40s so that's what caused this variation in a single quarter.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to understand how it works. And then could \u2013 Nick, maybe -- could we drill down on a little more on Europe? I mean, there's so much bad news coming out of there. It seems that you're doing very well over there, relative to what the perception is, but could you maybe talk about, which countries are really carrying the loads there for you? I mean, you mentioned Southern Europe as definitely having some negative issues, but maybe could you kind of go through Europe...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I mean, Spain and Portugal and I guess, Italy some. And to the extent we have business -- we've got big business. As you know, we have big business in Spain, pretty big business in Portugal, we've got little in Greece, but Greece, we have business. And it's not so good. And so you see sort of if you draw a line across the south, we're getting pretty big headwind there. And the problem was, just to reiterate, as maybe as you know, but I'll just say it, we have the biggest shares in Spain and Portugal, so our margins were kind of strongest in that situation. Now if you want to talk about the other regions of Europe, first and foremost, what's going very well for us is Eastern Europe. Russia and the sort of Orthodox countries, they are very strong for us. The Nordic countries and the low countries are doing very well for us. We're seeing -- and so those are the businesses, those are the countries that are standing out, I think. Eastern Europe and the Nordic countries are standing out for us. The rest of Europe is kind of doing okay, but it's not as strong as Scandinavia or Russia and then the low countries.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So when you're talking about Nordic countries, that\u2019s not Germany.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'm talking about Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe could you \u2013 with your people that are on the ground there, I mean, walk with them, as I'm sure you do. Is there any kind of level of apprehension among the people there or your people as to what's going to be the end event here with Greece and the euro...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I have to tell you though, no. Actually the people at the ground level don't seem concerned about that; they seem confident. And this is just anecdotally, Gary, anecdotally. When you talk to customers, or you talk to our people, they see much more confident in the solution of the euro and everything that's involved in that I'd say, Americans are. That's just how I characterize it. They don't seem as alarmed to me. I think, surprisingly, actually, but they seem very confident, and I don't know what to do with that, but I think that obviously, they do have problems and there is a lot of discussion in the press. And there's questions about what's going to happen in Europe. And we already talked about the idea that it limits our visibility, but if you're talking about the people at the ground, our people, seem to be confident that a solution is going to be worked out. And things are going to move on in Europe. The one thing I can say about our European business is we're clear, that even in Spain and Portugal, we haven't lost share. It\u2019s just that these businesses are that's our business is still intact. So we're just there on hold waiting for the idea that the market comes back.", "Operator", "And we go next to Jarrod Rapalje with Longbow Research.", "Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC", "So one last question on Europe and just -- I understand the Southern Europe's weak and to the extent that it does carry over to these other countries, can you just talk about your profitability over there compared to the U.S. and the downside risks to earnings power in some sort of quantifiable way?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. We never quantify the probability in Europe. I think we haven't done that, but I'll just say that our profitability in Europe has never been as strong as the United States. So if you're going to compare those 2, it's just never been as strong for us in Europe as it has been in the United States.", "Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then secondly within the Snap-on Tools segment, can you break out that organic growth between price and volumes?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, yes. Price is about between 0.5% and 1%, just a small amount. We generally price for material inflation. We feel that -- if you've listened to prior calls, we say generally that we can always get visible inflation back in pricing. And that's what they've done over the past year and that turns out for us to be between 0.5% and 1%.", "Jarrod Rapalje - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So safe to say that with that pricing, you guys are recovering all the raw material inflation you guys are seeing and is that a headwind right now?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure. No, no, no. We're able to price for it. I mean, it's not a headwind. First of all, Snap-on isn't that big a purchaser. Our biggest commodities are freight and steel. And we buy, I think, we said about 75 million of steel. So if you think about that, it's not a lot. Our biggest input to a hand tool is labor. And so the commodity headwinds are a factor, and I often say this on these calls, I say we can price for it. I\u2019ll probably say -- I'd say we can deal with it, and I'm pretty confident we have and we will as long as it's visible. So if somebody decided -- we put titanium, say, in our steel; if somebody decided to increase of the price of titanium by 20x, probably we might not be able to price for that. And then -- because no one would know, but if steel goes up by 10%, we can price for that. Now on top of that, we have a very -- as part of our Snap-on value creation processes we have a -- something called RCI, Rapid Continuous Improvement and we're out every day in every site with dedicated people. We have a dedicated guy in every site, pushing cost reduction and productivity. So not only do we have a pricing, but we have this productivity flowing through our plans.", "Operator", "And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore Ms. Kratcoski, I will turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Rufus.

Please go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Yolanda, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's Fourth Quarter 2011 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.

With that said, I will now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Well, our fourth quarter represented an encouraging performance to cap off the year. The progress was not only reflected in the financials, but it also can be seen in our strategic advancements. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles and processes we use everyday to guide our actions, they're driving results. Our focus on safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, as we often call it, it's paying off. And we believe the advancements made throughout 2011 on our runways for both growth and improvement position us to go forward with strength. Aldo will provide detail on the financials. But first, I'll offer some of my perspectives on the highlights for both the quarter and for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were up organically by almost 6% from 2010. Operating income rose about 30% with our operating margin of 16.3%, up from 13.5% last year. Now that profit increase, of course, included some substantially higher earnings for Financial Services. As expected, that rise came right along with the continuing buildup of our on-book portfolio. But before Financial Services, the operating margin was 14.1% and that compares to 12.6% last year and represents a new high for Snap-on for any quarter.", "With respect to the economic environment, the events in Europe are creating a bit more of a headwind. I don't think that'll come as a surprise to anybody. I would, however, still characterize our overall market on balance as favorable, fairly stable and you see that in our overall sales growth. Just as we've demonstrated since the recovery began, we were once again able to gain position and to find the pockets of strength that allowed us to offset areas of external weakness. ", "I told you during the discussion about 3 months ago that our third quarter sales volumes, excluding the effects of currency movements, were above the pre-recession levels of 2007 and 2008. That was the first time we could claim an overall recovery in volumes. While the fourth quarter continued that overall trend, today we're reporting results that exceed fourth quarter 2007 levels, which is the most appropriate pre-recession comparison. And in addition, sales increased sequentially off the third quarter, consistent with our normal seasonality. So while Europe does pose some challenges, we are maintaining our momentum.", "Now for some highlights from each of the segments and a discussion of our advancements in 4 strategic areas, extending into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise network and expanding in the repair garage. We've identified these runways as being decisive for our future, and we made solid progress in each of them during the quarter and, for that matter, throughout 2011. In the Commercial & Industrial segment or C&I, organic sales increased almost 5% in the quarter. That growth was somewhat higher than the past couple of periods. So while C&I was where we see the most impact from the challenges of Europe due to our large hand tool operation in the region, SNA Europe, we actually saw better year-over-year comparisons than we've been posting recently. That progress was due to the gains in our Industrial business and to our continued growth in emerging markets, both in C&I. The C&I segment margin for the quarter of 11.2% was down from last year's 12.6%, largely reflecting the $2.9 million in additional restructuring charges and some challenges to the profits at SNA Europe, as that part of the world is obviously not yet recovering. That margin rate, however, was improved from what we saw in the past couple of quarters, reflecting the relative strength of our Industrial businesses, which posed double-digit growth and reached new performance highs.", "Speaking of our Industrial division, we made good progress throughout 2011, we said that on these calls, extending into critical industries. In the earlier periods, however, those gains were somewhat masked by the lower military activity. In fact, it was actually real positive that the reduced military volume was effectively offset by our growth in serving the other critical industries. But now, our gains in critical sectors such as aerospace and natural resources are showing through. They're visible. That activity in those areas is supported not only by the innovative Automated Tool Control or ATC system, which is somewhat of a halo product,  and has garnered a lot of important attention. But it also reflects -- that attention also reflects a wide array of hand and torque and power tools, all designed specifically to make the work easier for customers in critical industries. It's that expanded offering and the increased focus that's driving the rise in orders to support flight lines, assembly facilities, maintenance, repair and overhaul operations, oil rigs, mines and power plants, and giving us an ever-growing presence.", "C&I is also where we see much of the benefit from our emerging market strategy. Now when you say emerging markets, everybody naturally thinks of China, but our emerging growth is rooted more broadly. In the quarter, C&I saw double-digit gains across Eastern Europe, including in important markets like Russia and in Turkey. So 2011 was a strong year for our emerging markets where we saw large gains, not only in the countries I just mentioned, but across Asia as well in places like Indonesia and Thailand and of course, in India and China. And we're supporting that growth with investments. During the year, we expanded our band saw capacity in China and in Minsk, and it's paid off with substantial new customers and volumes across the globe. In China alone, we now have more than triple band saw capacity since our start up. This past year, we also launched a handheld diagnostics unit specifically for the China market, and our Asianized undercar equipment line is making solid inroads with local automotive repair customers.", "When we spoke of emerging markets, I've said in the past that succeeding there is often about presence and physicals, and we're showing our commitment to that belief by building. For example, in China, just this past quarter we opened another facility, our new state-of-the-art Engineering Center at our complex in Kunshan. And in 2012, we'll be expanding again with a new undercar equipment factory aimed at making sure that we can continue to serve that growing local market.", "Now let's move on to the Tools Group. Sales in the fourth quarter rose over 9% organically. Operating margin at 13.5% was up from 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Now I'll remind you that in 2010, the 2010 number included a $4.6 million restructuring charge related to consolidating the North American tool storage production into one facility. But while the year-over-year gain is somewhat amplified, the fourth quarter rise to 13.5% still represents a 230 basis point increase even after adjusting for the favorable restructuring compares.", "The quarter's result, taken together with the full year operating margin at 13.7% for the Tools Group indicate clearly that, that operation is showing significant positive momentum. Given that one of our key priorities we set for ourselves years back was in fact, strengthening the van channel, I'm encouraged that it appears to be quite robust as we enter 2012. Throughout last year, I was able to point out significant progress in that area. Snap-on being ranked #6 of all franchise opportunities by Franchise Direct and the Frost & Sullivan survey, more recognition of Snap-on by professional technicians as their preferred brand by larger margins, wider than ever before, and awards from MOTOR Magazine and Professional Tools & Equipment News for innovative products that make the technician's job easier. But more importantly, more important than outside recognition, the best testimony to a strong system comes directly from our franchisees. They've told us in confidential surveys and in public discussions that overwhelmingly, if given the chance to do it all over, they would again commit to a Snap-on franchise and they would also recommend the opportunity to a friend or family member. That may be the best endorsement we can ever get. Just this past week, and I spent a weekend -- just this past month, I spent a weekend with a number of our franchisees during the annual kickoff meetings and their enthusiasm, I'm telling you, confirms the progress we've made. They tell me that one of their big advantages while out calling on technicians is our captive finance companies, Snap-on Credit. Our successful transition from a joint venture to a wholly-owned Snap-on entity without our customers' experience, and any disruption was certainly a key factor in maintaining the health of our network and in supporting the global growth we've been posting. The credit companies' portfolio continues to ramp up onto our book. It's performing well and it's adding to our bottom line. But more important than the financial returns, in today's world of tight credit, our franchisees and our technician customers are benefiting significantly from access to consistent and available financing. And we see it in the numbers. The growth in the operation -- so that's some color on the state of the tools. The growth in that operation has been substantial. And I can say that all of those things I've just mentioned are driving the growth, and we are very encouraged by the results of the Tools Group in this period, it's showings strength. Now for Repair Systems and Information or the RS&I. Fourth quarter organic sales were up 2.4%. The operating margin was 20.8%, and that compares to the 19.7% achieved in 2010. The growth in the operation was somewhat muted by our undercar equipment business, which is the other area where we have exposure to Europe reflecting our significant market position in that region. Remember that the RS&I businesses are focused on serving repair shop owners and managers, and they're working to expand our strong brands of products throughout the repair garages of the world. I mentioned our equipment product position in Europe. Well, in the fourth quarter, we reinforced that strength when we launched our updated V3D aligner in Paris. That new product offers some attractive productivity enhancing features such as a VIN reader that automatically loads the vehicle's specification, and an improved user-friendly technician interface. Both innovations that simplified vehicle alignment. And as you might imagine, the new unit was quite enthusiastically received. ", "We also continued to get great reviews for our new diagnostic wheel balancer, which was recognized by MOTOR Magazine as one of the top 10 products. I mentioned it last quarter, our unique imaging technology providing a digital map of actual and predicted tire wear and heading off problems with a quick balance and just a few spins of the wheel. That product is now being placed in training facilities where technicians learn and/or enhance their craft. Both the new aligner and the new balancer represent just the type of innovation that we continue to roll out. And we believe that, that's the key to gaining position and to overcoming economic challenges -- offer products that pay back through productivity, gain committed users who are trained using those very products.", "As the economics for the automotive OEM seem to be improving, we've seen those manufacturers commit to new essential tool requirements, customized diagnostics for both their U.S. and European dealer bases, and we're getting our share of that business. We're also expanding into near adjacent segments. I've spoken in the past about growth in the medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicle sector with repair informations and diagnostics products that capitalize on our unique knowledge, bringing it into that sector. In that same manner, we're also able to take that information technology and that diagnostic know-how and apply it to areas such as agricultural and construction equipment. We're starting to get traction there and both those areas represent attractive opportunities. And when you reach further into that same segment, we also see that our Electronic Parts Catalog or EPCs, products that work so well in aiding vehicle technicians to prescribe, locate and order just the right part, also had important applications for those working on agricultural and construction equipment. Our EPCs are also becoming a valuable opportunity in this space. As I mentioned in the past, our overall EPC business was challenged by the decline in the U.S. automotive OEM dealership group tax. So we've been extending to other opportunities. Our expertise in serving independent repairs, repair garages with shock management repair information and handheld diagnostics gives us, we believe, a unique customer connection and an insight into those customers' needs. We've taken that advantage and successfully deployed an all made EPC called more [ph] for the independent markets. The product offers the independent shop an access to the parts operations of OEM dealerships, providing availability and pricing and parts ordering information. And this is a business in which both dealerships and independents want to participate. Now integrated with our Mitchell 1 shop management software, the combination offers even more efficient workflow and productivity in the independent shops throughout the United States. You can see by this discussion I think that we're working across the corporation to provide a full array of products to repair shops and our managers, from diagnostics, to repair information, to shop management software, to undercar equipment and including customized tool storage units. It's paying off with independents and with OEM dealerships. In fact, many of the larger dealerships are outfitting their shops with a consistent professional look that is more and more demanded by OEMs, all while providing great productivity solutions, and we're helping them do it.", "Well, those are the highlights. Organic growth in the quarter of almost 6%, encouraging from an overall post-recovery perspective. Operating income increases at both OpCo and SinCo [ph], reaching new highs, our areas of strength combining to more than offset any headwinds. An abundant evidence, clear evidence that we're continuing to take strides, clearly moving forward along strategic runways for coherent growth. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed discussion of the financial results. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick, and good morning to everyone. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. ", "Net sales in the fourth quarter of $736.6 million increased $39.7 million or 5.7% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.9%, reflecting sales growth across the majority of our businesses. Higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group combined with increased sales to a wide range of customers in critical industries and emerging markets, higher essential tool and facilitation program sales and higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 software products more than offset weakness in Europe, particularly in the southern regions. Consolidated gross profit of $335.8 million in the quarter increased to $17.3 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 45.6% in the quarter was comparable with last year. Operating expenses in the quarter of $232 million were on par with 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 31.5% in the quarter improved 160 basis points from 33.1% last year, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives, lower bad debt expense and lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation expense. These improvements were partially offset by higher performance -based incentive compensation expense and $2.6 million of higher pension expense. Restructuring cost the $4.4 million in the quarter compared to $5.8 million last year.", "Operating earnings before Financial Services of $103.8 million in the quarter increased $16.3 million or 18.6% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services improved 150 basis points from 12.6% last year to 14.1% this year. Operating earnings from Financial services of $22.1 million in the quarter improved $12.7 million from 2010 levels, reflecting the continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $125.9 million in the quarter increased $29 million or 29.9% from 2010 levels. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings of 16.3% improved 280 basis points from 13.5% a year ago.", "Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 33% compared with the 30.1% rate of last year. The lower 2010 rate benefited from nonrecurring tax items, including the December 2010 extension of certain federal tax incentives. ", "Finally, net earnings of $74.3 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the quarter were an all-time  fourth quarter record, up $16.4 million or 28.3% from last year's levels. Now let's turn to our segment results.", "Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $295.4 million for the fourth quarter increased 4.9% from 2010 levels. Higher year-over-year sales to a wide range of customers in emerging markets and in critical industries, particularly aerospace and natural resources, were partially offset by the weakness in Europe. Gross profit of $106.4 million in the quarter declined $1.6 million from 2010 levels, largely due to $2.9 million of higher restructuring cost, incurred to further improve the segments cost structure in Europe. In addition, benefits from higher sales and RCI incentive were partially offset by margin pressure in Europe. Gross margin of 36% in the quarter compared with 38.4% last year. Operating expenses of $73.4 million in the quarter were up slightly from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 24.8% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 25.8% last year, primarily due to benefits from RCI initiatives and sales volume leverage. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $33 million for the C&I segment declined $2.4 million or 6.8% from 2010 levels, largely due to $2.7 million of higher year-over-year restructuring costs. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 11.2% in the C&I segment compared with 12.6% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. ", "Fourth quarter sale from the Snap-on Tools Group of $292.8 million improved $24.6 million or 9.2% from 2010 levels, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. Gross profit in the Snap-on Tools Group of $123.9 million in the quarter increased $16.7 million from 2010. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 42.3% in the quarter improved 230 basis points from 40% last year, primarily due to $4.3 million of lower restructuring cost, benefits from favorable foreign currency effects and continued savings from RCI initiatives. Last year, the Snap-on Tools Group incurred $4.6 million of initial restructuring cost in the fourth quarter for the 2011 closure of the Newmarket, Canada tool storage manufacturing facility. ", "Operating expenses of $84.3 million in the quarter increased $2.9 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 28.8% in the quarter improved 160 basis points from 30.4% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $39.6 for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $13.8 million or 53.5% year-over-year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 13.5% increased 390 basis points from 9.6% a year ago. Excluding the effect of restructuring expense, operating income margin improved 230 basis points year-over-year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems and Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $236.5 million increased $4.7 million or 2% from last year's levels. Excluding currency translation, organic sales increased 2.4%, mainly due to higher sales in our Equipment Solutions business, which facilitates essential tool programs for OEMs, along with higher sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 software products to repair shop owners and managers. These increases more than offset the weaker sales to European equipment distributors that Nick already mentioned. Gross profit of $105.5 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million from prior year levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin was 44.6% in both the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010. Gross margin improvements in 2011 from ongoing RCI initiatives were primarily offset by higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $56.3 million in the quarter decreased $1.3 million from 2010 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 23.8% in 2011 improved 110 basis points from 24.9% last year, principally due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.", "Operating earnings of $49.2 million for the RS&I group increased $3.5 million or 7.7% from 2010. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 20.8% in the quarter increased 110 basis points from 19.7% last year.", "Now turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter operating earnings from Financial Services was $22.1 million on revenue of $35.5 million. This compares with operating earnings of $9.4 million on $21.5 million of revenue last year. The $12.7 million year-over-year increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $155 million in the quarter rose 9.1% compared to last year's levels, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs.", "Moving to Slide 11. As of the fourth quarter end, our balance sheet includes $935 million of gross financing receivables, including $786 million from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation and $149 million from our international finance subsidiaries. ", "In the U.S., $636 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During 2011, our on-book financing portfolio has grown just over $200 million. The pace of the portfolio's on balance sheet development has continued as expected and will naturally decelerate as the transition of the CIT owned portfolio to Snap-on Credit nears completion. As such, for the full year 2012, we anticipate that the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels, which is slightly ahead of our previously communicated future state level for the portfolio of approximately $1 billion. As our transition moves towards completion, we expect further expansion of the Snap-on Credit portfolio to largely reflect activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow of $72.3 million for the quarter and $128.5 million for the year includes the effect of a $48 million discretionary cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans. For the full year 2011, we contributed in total approximately $61 million to our various global pension plans. As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services in the quarter was a negative $36 million, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. The operating company generated positive free cash flow of $58.3 million in the quarter, representing a $33 million increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures of $14.6 million in the quarter and $61 million for the full year, included continued spending to support our strategic growth initiatives, including the expansion and enhancement of manufacturing capabilities in both the U.S. and abroad. As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days at 2011 year end, improved from 61 days at 2010 year end. Inventories increased approximately $60 million from 2010 year-end levels, largely to support higher demand, mitigate potential supply chain disruption and improve customer service levels. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 4.2x compared to 4.7x at 2010 year end, reflective of the higher inventory. Sequentially, inventory [indiscernible] 4.1x in Q3. Our year-end cash position of $186 million decreased $387 million from 2010 year-end levels, principally due to the $200 million August debt repayment. Funding for new loans originated by Snap-on Credit. The previously disclosed $89.8 million second quarter repayment of amounts withheld from CIT and a $48 million discretionary pension contribution. Our net debt to capital ratio of 34.3% compares to 30.1% at 2010 year end, reflecting the uses of cash in 2011 that I just reviewed. In addition to our $186 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including our $500 million revolving credit facility and $200 million loan and servicing agreement. In addition, our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. As of 2011 year end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. This concludes my remarks on the fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few [Audio Gap] 2012 as outlined in this morning's release.", "We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in a range of $60 million to $70 million. Our restructuring expenses for the year are expected to include an estimated $6 million to $8 million charge in the second quarter associated with the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the Newmarket, Canada facility. Exclusive of this charge, pension expense in 2012 is expected to be comparable with 2011 levels. During 2012, we intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and $18.3 million to our domestic pension plans. Depending on market and other conditions, we may elect to make discretionary contributions to our domestic plans. Finally, we anticipate a full year effective income tax rate of approximately 33.5%. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, to wrap up, we're quite encouraged by our results for the full year in general and for the fourth quarter in particular. Our attention to the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are driving real improvement. OpCo operating margins for the year and the quarter were up from last year, 140 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively, both significant increases. And we continue to bring the credit company on-book with reliability, without disruption and with profitability, just as we said we would. We believe we're making clear advancements on our strategic runways for coherent growth, the van network is more robust, profits are up, turnover is down. RS&I is expanding our offering to shop owners and managers in new places. Our growth in critical industries within double digits, and we've built more physical capability in emerging markets with the opening of our new engineering center in Kunshan. As usual, we do have continuing challenges in Europe and other places, but the strength of our strategic initiatives brought us to an almost 6% organic sales gain in this quarter, well into our target post-recovery range, despite the headwinds. And our operating company in common, OI margin for both the quarter and the year, represent record levels for our company despite the headwinds. Summing it all up, we're encouraged by the results, by the progress they evidence, by the strength they confirm and most of all, by the prospects they imply. ", "I'll end, as we always do, by recognizing that the performance over the quarter and the year reflects the special dedication of our Snap-on associates and franchisees around the world. ", "I know that many of you are listening. You are the ones who have created this performance and have made this trend possible. For your extraordinary contribution to Snap-on and for your unwavering commitment to our team, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Joe on the line for David. I'm sorry I hopped on the call a little late, so I apologize if you gave this number. But the past few quarters, you've given us C&I organic growth number x Europe, would you happen to know them?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "C&I number x Europe, I don't know if we've given that in the past.  I think we gave it Southern Europe in the past, I'm not sure we have that or interested in giving that or will give that at this time. If you want to call back later maybe we...", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, I was just -- rather to have, I guess, excluding the headwinds, so Southern Europe but I...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "The thing to do, if you --  what I will tell you is this, Europe breaks down pretty much like this. If you look at our businesses in Europe, we have Southern Europe and Southern Europe is down further than it has been in the past, 15% to 20% now. And so that is particularly right down the center of C&I. This time, we have an impact on the Equipment -- we have the Equipment business, which is down in Europe Now I'm not sure if that's economy related or just 1/4 motion, because the Equipment business can be a little lumpy. And last year, there was a couple of shows in Europe that made it difficult, and that made the comparisons difficult. But the rest of Europe for us is up 2% to 3%. Now that's softened from where we were. If you pull out -- I suspect if you pull out everything out of all the European businesses out of C&I, you're talking about a 5% to 6% to 7% growth in C&I, so you're still seeing a pretty robust business if you take Europe out of it. Now I will call your attention to, if you weren't on the call, the big pieces that's very strong in C&I is the Industrial business, and we've been mentioning that our runway for growth and in critical industries has been open for us. And in the past quarters, it's been masked by the military activity going down. But this quarter, with the military activity comparisons being a little softer on a year-over-year basis, that business grew by double digits. So in balance, you have C&I down, you have C&I impacted by Europe but still growing in our 4% to 6% range, so let's say at around this 5% to 6% range without Europe.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right, great. And I actually wanted to touch on the other growth aspect of C&I, the emerging market piece. Do you happen to know what Thailand as a percent of that segment represents, because I'd imagine with all the flooding, they're going to need a lot of car repair in the near term?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Would you think less of me if I admitted to not knowing the Thailand number at this time. But if you want to call in, we may have it. I think our business is reasonable in Thailand but a kind of secondary market. The big markets in Asia are India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Philippines. Thailand would be in the second level around Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. I think you're right. I think there is opportunity for it to grow there. We have a good share. We have a reasonable position, at least in the, I guess, top end of the market.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. And then one last one for me, the Tools business obviously had a great quarter and organic growth accelerated sequentially, growing 9% wherein Q3 it looks like it was up 6% organic. You've always talked about that business being maybe at the lower end of the 4% to 6% sustainable range. I'm just wondering, going from 9%, what's going on in that business that's enabling such strong growth and where do you see it going forward to the next...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think one quarter does not a whole trend make. So I wouldn't get -- I don't think we get excited about any of our businesses, particularly about one quarter or another. I think you can't draw any conclusions, big conclusions from one quarter. But I'll say this, the Tools Group, we have said for a long time that they have to deal with a certain fixed space, the technicians in the United States. But then we have also said very quickly that our vans call on only a subset -- fully enabled, our vans only call on a subset of that space because they've just -- it's a productivity issue. They only have so many hours in the week, because they have to call on these people every week. And if we can enable them with RCI, then volume will accrue. And that's what's been happening. You're seeing RCI flow through the vans. Now is it going to happen at 9% every quarter? I don't know. I can't comment on that. But I think what you're seeing in the robust quarter is a combination of things, but one of the major factors is the effect of that van network being more robust, being more productive and therefore, capturing more sales of those technicians and calling on more of them.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "If you had to give a baseball analogy, how much more room you have to go in the productivity initiatives with the van network, where would you think you're at?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't have to give a small analogy though, but I don't know. I think there's quite a bit of runway there, but we have said, I think, our targets, our range is 4% to 6%. We've said that the Tools Group, because of the fixed nature of its business, will be at the lower end of that with RS&I in the middle and C&I at the top end. And we don't -- nothing in this quarter tells us that, that's wrong. Okay?", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Market.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "This is Mike Wherley standing in. You guys mentioned restructuring in Europe in the C&I business and I was just wondering, have you resized the SNA Europe to reset up a lower demand level or do you still have belief that those markets are coming back?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "We believe the markets are coming back. What you see in the restructuring is simply the effect of RCI rolling through that business so we can do our target with less.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So no change to sort of the size of...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, we might. Jim, we might have closed -- we didn't close any big operations or anything like that or rationalize the distribution. We're just -- I think this is what I would call aggressively RCI-ing the business.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then when we look at RS&I, the revenue growth, it's still there but it decelerated from like 5% and 10% the last 2 quarters. And I'm just wondering, relative to like that 10% 2 quarters ago, how much of that is due to Europe versus just some tougher comps as you came out in the downturn.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Both, Jim. I think that if you're looking at the 10%, that's the easier comps. When you go back and you look at the trend of RS&I, I mean the growths were 11%, 7%, 9%, 6%, 4%, 8%. so you saw it coming off the easier comps. And in fact, some of those businesses were slower to come back than others. So you saw that rolling through the business. Rolling through that sector. What you saw in the fourth quarter was fundamentally the equipment business being a little bit off the boil. And I don't -- and a lot of it's in Europe and we're not sure how to interpret that. I'm not willing to say it's economic-related, I just think we do see from time to time lumpiness in the Equipment business. So the 2.4% in organic and RS&I in the quarter, yes, it's below what we would normally expect, but not I would call what I'd say concerning to us or alarming.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "But would you say it's more from the weakness in Europe than tougher comps?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I'd say so. I'd say so. Yes, I'd say that. I'd say that.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And then just the last question I had on the Financial Services portfolio...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "So let me clarify that for a minute, if I could. The one thing, the one clarification that as I said, I think, in the last point is that Europe Equipment business had in itself a noneconomic tougher comp because it has every other year's show cycles and so therefore, there's some of that flowing through this business. So all things being equal, we would have not expected as robust the fourth quarter out of RS&I because of this. Now I'm not saying that accounts for all of this, but that's a factor.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. The last question I had was on Financial Services and you talk about that portfolio being over $1 billion, a little bigger than you had thought before -- by the end of next year or -- and I'm just wondering is that more because the Tools Group is doing well or is it because of other credit offerings outside the Tools Group?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Mike, this is Aldo. It really reflects a higher pace of growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. We do like to work closely with the Tools Group, it's one of the advantages of having a captive finance company. So the Snap-on Credit Corporation works intimately with them to design programs that encourage greater levels of participation. So what I think you see is that we've had a more rapid of ramp-up of originations in the Snap-on Credit Company, reflecting really increased financial health and commercial health of the franchisee network, and that spills over into their customer base. And I think that's why you see some increased performance in the Tools Group itself, and Snap-on Credit also participates in like fashion.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "On the RCI Slide -- I'm sorry the C&I Slide...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Do you mean RS&I?", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "No, C&I.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "C&I, okay.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "The gross profit line, if I add back the $2.9 million in restructuring costs, I'm still coming up with a 37% of sales gross profit margin. So that leaves us with 140 basis points decline in margin from year-over-year. So I'm wondering, you had mentioned the RCI going through Europe and you've got some restructuring that you're going to do because of it, and you're going to be able to do more with less over there. Does that get us the 140 basis points of margin that we used to have? Or is there pricing pressure over there too?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, let me just speak to that a moment. First, I think it's just -- I think the most -- I guess, the most informative way to look at C&I is not necessarily gross margin, because what you have flowing through that is you have business mix, for example, as some of that. I'm not saying it's the whole effect but I'm saying some of it, it gets distorted by the fact that when Asia-Pacific grows, Asia-Pacific is, by definition, a low gross margin business and a low OE business, still as profitable from an OI business. So that tends to reek a little bit of distortion, Richard, on that gross margin line. So if you roll over to OI which is still down, 140 basis points or something and you say, \"Okay, 90 basis points of that is restructuring,\" you're still down 50 basis points -- what's wrong, what's the problem. And the problem is Europe, you put your finger on it. And in Europe, there are 3 things going on. One is Southern Europe is down again and you may not have heard this, but I've said this on the calls before, for us, Southern Europe was our highest profitability and margin business. So there is a mix question as Southern Europe shrinks further for us on a year-over-year comparison basis. That creates some impact. Then there is the question of -- they have a cocktail of currencies, they source from a number different places on renminbi and the Argentine peso and a number of different places. And those things turn somewhat favorably, so that's some impact. And then, which I think is the more interesting view is, we have in Europe what we're calling a stimulus program where we focus on places where we think we could gain with customers by having programs that attached a little bit more effort, a little bit more support, a little bit more price support. And those kinds of things impact as well. It worked for us in the recession in the United States. We had a stimulus program that targeted places where we thought we could advance our position, and that's what we're playing out in Europe. So those are the 3 factors that have tended to pretty much move that OI margin down. Now are we going to get back? I think that's the intent over time, but I'm not saying that -- I don't think you can say, \"Look, we made these restructuring actions in Europe, and that's going to fix the problem,\" because the problem in Southern Europe is frankly too deep to be fixed by RCI actions. Our whole structure in Europe is -- our whole view, approach to Europe is saying, \"Look, we're watching our customers, we're watching our distribution, we're seeing our share and we believe this market's coming back. We think we'll be stronger than before and therefore, we're just preparing for that day because we think we can capitalize on that.\"", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "The car market over in Europe is quite a bit different. The repair business, the artisan keeping his tools to do his trade is the same. But over in Europe, you've got about 1/2 of the cars that belong to fleets. How does that dynamic factor in when we've got a slowing economic environment? I would think that these corporations would be holding onto these vehicles longer and trying to get more use out of them, therefore, there might be more repair opportunities. Is that how to look at it?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I think that might be true. I think you'll be entitled to that assumption. It certainly happened in the United States as people -- as new car volumes go down. People hold on their cars longer and that drives more repair, so that would be one tailwind we would see. Now remember when we're talking about Europe, we're less auto-centric than we are in the United States, but that's what still give us a boost, because we have our automotive business in Europe. And the way we structured that wouldn't all come out of C&I. We've seen some of it in Tools, we've seen some of -- that phenomena you're talking about, we've seen some of it in Tools, we've seen some of it in RS&I and so on, but it would be a clear tailwind for us.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good. Last area I wanted to touch on was again this objective of achieving $1 billion plus on the balance sheet for Financial Services. As time goes by and we see economic improvement over here in the U.S. and new car sales start to improve, on the one hand, we might have a decline in the aftermarket in the sense that people aren't keeping the used car as much. They're getting more new. But on the other hand, as that economic conditions improve, there might be more creation of additional repair shops, which would need tooling to get up and running. Is that part of where the increase in the funding or the receivables comes from is an assumption that we'll see an increase in franchisees, and because there's an increase in the number of shops coming as the economy improves?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Again, Richard, Aldo. I'll answer that as best I can. I think the growth in the portfolio, as envisioned, is mostly on the extended credit portfolio side, which is the bread and butter of what we do. It makes up 81% of what we do today. And I think the lion share of the growth beyond where we're at right now, the additional $125 million, I think we see on the slide that $95 million or so come -- or 77% of those, still come from extended credit. So again, that's catering to the mechanic as an end customer via the franchise network. What you hinted at, there will be some of it that's called -- what we call the leasing, when shop owners -- it's a small piece of what we do, it makes them about 4% to 5% of the Snap-on Credit portfolio today as leasing activity. When the shop owners sometimes needs financing, they will sometimes consider Snap-on credit as a source. But that's a little bit of a different credit profile, different bit of a mix and therefore, they have other alternatives available for them, they have -- can have local banks that might be available for them as a source of funds, as well as Snap-on Credit as well as other leasing companies. So to answer your question if shops expand, that does create an opportunity for Snap-on credit to grow, but the lion share of the growth that we're talking about is just the increased participation of our activity with mechanics as end customers.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "But I think you're -- I just want to add to that. I think you're right about an underlying sort of macro in there. And that generally, in markets we have seen, one of the great things about being in critical industries in automotive repair is critical tasks. And automotive repair is one of those, is they tend to move upwards as the world facilitized. For example, you mentioned new cars and so on, but new cars, the new car market in the United States, has been up or down. It's $9 million, $10 million, I think $17 million. And despite that, cars have gotten older every year since 1980. So the idea of the repair and demand keeps going upward, and I think that is just an underlying trend that says, \"Okay, there are going to be more shops.\" There's going to be more demand for repair, and in fact, when you look at the statistics about the average household spend on automotive repair, it's going up. It went up again last quarter and it's been going up pretty much regularly every quarter for a long time. So you're correct at putting your finger on one of the great driving points behind these macro driving points behind this businesses.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just as a follow-on to that, what's the anticipated growth rate in the number of franchisees for the coming couple of years?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think -- I don't think we're going to see it move up that much. We have 3,400 -- depends on the geography in the United States, we have 3,467 now that moved a couple in the past few years. You might see some increase, but our play -- I think the play about numbers of franchisees is not there. What will happen, we believe, is efficiency. One, franchisees, the individuals will reach more customers, they call on 800,000 now, there are 1.3 million in the United States. They can call on more. It's a productivity issue. It's what I said before. Two, we have turnover, and it's an all-time low, but it's still about 8% a year. So you do the math and you figure out how many turnover, a couple -- 300 a year. And our ability to fill them quickly has to do with our ability to serve the market. So we get better every quarter at filling those things, and that adds capacity, even within the same number of shares. So the effect for the Tools Group is more around productivity for the vans themselves, that's the growth place. And our productivity internally, where we could be more efficient and popping somebody in when they're ready to retire.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions here. Hey Aldo, in terms of the overhead expenses related to Snap-on Credit, is that still running at about $25 million to $30 million?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "I think as a ratio, Gary, the best I can determine, let's say you're in the 6% range, if you look at what percent of revenues that they tend to generate, you'll see good drop through. The biggest expense that flexes as you grow the portfolio is really the provision for bad debt. As you grow the portfolio, you have to have -- anticipate bad debt expense that goes along with that. To me that's the biggest variable expense. Of course, there's underlying structural additions you look at. And we always look ahead to will it be increased costs of compliance. So there's some variables out there on the horizon, and we don't really give guidance around it. But it's a pretty scalable organization, but you don't have to have lots of incremental [ph] costs to grow.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Is that 6% of Financial Services revenue, 6% of the total loans out there?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "I'm looking at 6%, if you look at the top line more or less, if you look at where you're at. The financial expenses run in the order of about $50 million, $51 million, I believe, they were on a full year basis this year. So that's about -- that'll grow a little bit going forward. The biggest variable expense is really a provision for bad debt expense.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's fine. And then, Nick, you kind of mentioned in your talk that throughout the quarter you started Q4, obviously, Europe continues to weaken and we know the problems in the South and -- but can you maybe comment on what you're seeing so far in the quarter? Is there any changes there? I mean has it gotten worse in terms of both the North and South?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I hate to comment on the South of Europe because I seem to be -- I remember I was on one of these calls one time and I think I said I thought it bottomed out, and that turned out to be misinformed. So that was a long time ago. But we're not -- we don't give guidance, but I can say I don't think we're seeing any sea change, what -- we're seeing kind of the same stuff that we saw. And the interesting thing about Europe is if you look at it, it's kind of the same characteristics that we saw before, it's just that it generally weakened. The South is worse and then for us, the North was better and the Middle was kind of middling and that kind of thing, but we're not seeing any, I would say, any implosion or something like that.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. It's just I asked those questions because it's in the headlines constantly, and you'd think it's falling off a cliff. Okay. And then one thing you did mention in terms of especially in the RS&I, or Repair and Infosystems, you talked about the products you sell generally offer productivity improvements. Have you ever mentioned like what kind of return, what productivity return a shop gets from some of these products that you're putting through there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "We haven't mentioned it. We haven't mentioned it. It becomes so specific as, I think, being difficult. You kind of have to look at a particular shop and a particular product. I mean, some of them are things like let's take in an aligner, for example. It's hard to measure the idea that -- what the productivity return will be if I can have the aligner run by anybody in the shop as opposed to a specific aligner tech. And that's the kind of thing that happens. And also though, it happens faster and so on. So we have a number of those things, but they're very specific to the shop condition because as an example I just pointed out, if you have an aligner tech, a specific aligner tech and some shop have had them and you bring in the aligner, was one of our new aligners and anybody can do it while you can in fact, redeploy that aligner tech and you get great productivity. But if you're a shop that didn't use aligner techs and kind of muddle along without them, then it isn't quite as much a productivity improvement or as dramatic a productivity improvement. So it really depends on the particular situation. Now if you wanted to go to a garage and look at them, we could probably take you through the elements of that in the specific situation. I think that would be more effective.", "Operator", "We'll take a follow-up question from David Leiker's line.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All my questions have been answered.", "Operator", "And seeing no further question in our queue at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie H.

Kratcoski", "Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter 2012 results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. ", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.

I'll start off as usual with the highlights of the quarter and with my perspective on the results and on the overall business. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials. ", "Our first quarter was another period of encouraging progress. Once again, it showed that the Snap-on Value Creation Processes are enabling improvements just as they been doing for some time in a variety of macroeconomic environments. I think you could say that these past few years sure have been marked by a very dynamic environment. And yet, our discipline around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI has driven momentum in good times and in bad. ", "Speaking of momentum, our first quarter reflects continuing gains in the majority of our markets, and it represents another period of favorable operating margin comparisons. Organic sales increased 7% from last year. The OpCo operating margin of 13.3% was up 70 basis points, while FinCo contributed $23.9 million of operating income, a substantial increase from $12.5 million a year ago. The end result is an EPS of $1.21, a rise of 26% from the first quarter of 2011. ", "Now the primary feature in the past quarter was the volume. Widespread, strong gains across the majority of our business and the Tools Group serving automotive technicians and the Commercial & Industrial group or C&I serving emerging markets of Asia, as well as professionals in critical industries through our industrial division. And in diagnostics and software sales through our Repair Systems & Information group or RS&I, which focuses on serving repair shop owners and managers. All of those areas had solid gains. ", "If you recall that we identified 4 key strategic runways for our growth, areas that we believe will be decisive for our future, building in emerging markets, extending into critical industries, enhancing our franchise network and expanding in the garage. We believe this quarter's performance represent ample evidence of significant progress in each of these areas.", "Importantly, I think, our overall 7% volume gain and improved profitability was achieved even in the face of a turbulent Europe, a headwind that strengthened since the last quarter. ", "Just like in the past quarters, our overall environment is favorable, but Europe is a clear challenge. Our volumes in Western Europe and Western European markets were down mid-single digits. You can see that impact most notably in the results of C&I, but it's also evident in the volumes of RS&I where we have a sizable European presence in our undercar equipment business. ", "The real story in the quarter though is that we were, once again, able to overcome the challenges and still grow robustly. So overall, we continued our progress, gaining in those areas we've identified as being decisive for our growth. ", "Now on to the highlights of some of the segments. C&I group organic sales were up 6.4%. So in spite of Europe, our overall C&I sales gain was actually more than we posted in the previous 3 quarters. ", "I mentioned the strong gains in both Asia and our industrial business, 2 of those strategic runways for growth, while both of those businesses were up double digits. ", "Related to Europe, I'll remind you that we have particularly large and higher-margin position in the South, especially in Spain. And that regions been even harder hit than the rest of the continent, so that certainly amplifies the European impact for the group. Operating margins in C&I was 10.2% compared to 11.6% last year. Now in those numbers, we did incur $3.5 million and restructuring charges related to Europe. Given the situation, we're making adjustments to the cost structure to better match the environment. These actions brought C&I margin down by 120 basis points. ", "In our industrial business, where we serve serious professionals in critical industries, we're pursuing a number of initiatives to drive continued growth. For example, we're expanding our presence in technical schools, a growing number of which offer Snap-on's certification programs for industries such as aviation, vehicle repair and wind industry. And covering a range of specialties like torque and diesel and diagnostics and tool control. Those programs are -- we found are a great way to get the Snap-on brand introduced to the new professionals who will inhabit the critical industries of are our future. The schools are equipped with our products. We train the teachers, and the students learn their profession with Snap-on products front and center. We believe that's a great way to build what we call customers for life and it's working. ", "Our efforts in extending in the critical industries can be seen in our annual industrial sales kick off, hundreds of direct sales associates join that event and instead of focusing on products, we focused on serving specific customers: Aerospace, natural resources, the military. The main theme was customer connection, how to make work easier for particular professionals and specific industries and the participants left better equipped to drive our sales growth down that critical run -- down those crucial runways and that's been working. ", "Now I'll mention emerging markets. The bulk of that activity for Snap-on also shows in the C&I group. Sales in Asia were encouraging with double-digit growth coming across many of our major markets. Now China, of course, is our biggest opportunity, and we grew well ahead of GDP. But we saw an even greater increase in places like Indonesia and India. And that growth is being aided by our expanding product lines and hand tools from our Zhoushan factory and undercar equipment, hand held diagnostics and band saws, all from our Kunshan complex, where we've been expanding our capacity and launching new products, aimed specifically at Asian customers and that's working. ", "Outside of Asia, we're also making progress in other emerging markets. Our expansion in Belarus has been a key to gaining presence in Eastern Europe. That operation has been critical to growing our position in both in Eastern Europe, where SNA Europe actually saw solid gains in places like Russia and Turkey, as well as in the U.S. In fact, our Bahco band saw line continues to be robust, selling well in most regions of the world. ", "One final comment I'll make on C&I is related to innovation. SNA Europe and specifically the Bahco brand has long been known for its innovation and quality in serving professionals. In fact, Bahco recently celebrated 125 years of prominence in the professional segment. That reputation was, once again, reinforced this past quarter when Bahco earned 2 prestigious 2012 Red Dot Design awards. The winning new products were entries in our ergo line, a line that differentiates itself by clear advancement in professional grade ergonomics. Those awards generate product excitement and exposure, and our strong endorsement of our brand and of our continuing innovation and of the progress we're making in spite of the challenges that are present all around Europe. ", "Moving to the Tools Group, another strong performance. A sales increase of over 12%. It represents another highlight of the quarter. The operating margin of 14.6% was up from 13.2% a year ago. Now, last year's comparison did include nearly $3 million in restructuring charges, but even excluding that effect, there was a 50 basis point increase and this quarter's absolute margin of 14.6% certainly exceeds most of the historical comparisons. ", "You might remember, we made it a priority to enhance and strengthen our franchise channel, even while we're in the midst of a recession. And more recently, we were aiming Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI efforts toward increased efficiency, creating more selling time for our franchisees. ", "Now the results of all those efforts appear clear. Organic sales in the first quarter were more than 15% above our prerecession levels. Speaking of the franchisees, overall, the network is strong. And it's evident in the trends we track. Franchisee sales and profits continue to rise, credit delinquencies remain at historically low rates and our turnovers are down. To look beyond the franchisees, we see solid indicators on the health of our end customers, the repair technicians, activity with big-ticket items like hand held diagnostics and tool storage remain at the solid levels, as you would expect given the growth rates we've been recording for several quarters now. ", "And the strength, the core of our franchise network, the Snap-on brand is now being recognized even more broadly. The results from this year's franchise business review satisfaction survey were announced in February. Snap-on moved up 8 spots from last year to #23 among all large franchise systems. The importance of this ranking is that it's based on the opinions of our franchisees themselves on issues like training and support and operation and financial opportunity. And in February, Snap-on was also cited by Forbes magazine in its ranking of best franchisees to start for the buck, and that article, Snap-on was rated #1 of all franchisees. More confirmation of the growing strength of our system. ", "The results are also reinforced what we hear regularly when we speak to our franchisees face-to-face. I characterized their outlook as almost uniformly quite positive, both for the company in general and for their individual businesses in particular. ", "Now we're for Snap-on credit. I said it in the past, it's -- but I think it's worth repeating. Our wholly-owned finance company has been a real advantage. Just this week, there's been news relating to the difficulties of securing financing for small businesses in general and for franchises specifically. While our franchisees clearly benefit from their ability to access valuable financing for themselves and for their customers, the credit company is a strategic advantage for Snap-on, and as you can see, evidenced in the first quarter results, it's financially attractive. ", "Now let's move to the RS&I group, where we serve repair shop owners and managers with diagnostics repair and shock management information and undercar equipment. The overall organic growth gained for the group -- the overall organic sales gain for the group was a modest 1%. Similar to the C&I group though, some fairly strong sales performances were muted by the impact of European weakness. Our large undercar equipment business on that continent was down in the quarter. ", "Outside of the Europe impact, the gains across the operations in the group were up mid-single digits. The operating margin for RS&I was 21.5%, up from 18.9% last year and the highest we seen in the group. It reflects progress in our RCI initiatives, as well as favorable effects of solid growth in higher-margin categories of diagnostics and information products. ", "We are worried about those high-margin products. Our hand held diagnostics software sales reached an all-time quarterly high, driven by our new release. This update includes expanded vehicle coverage, along with the new functional tests and reprogramming features and the numbers show it was well-received. ", "Our diagnostics business also received recognition for innovation when the readers of Undercar Digest voted 2 of our hand held diagnostic units: The SOLUS Ultra and the VERDICT, as 2012 top 10 tools. This marked the second year in a row that Snap-on has had the only diagnostic units included in that publications award roster. That recognition not only is a testimony to our position as leader in the space, but inclusion of diagnostic units in the top 10 also provides significant evidence of the increasing importance of a handheld unit in undercar work and repairing breaks, wheels and chassis. With our strong position in that segment, this is a favorable trend for Snap-on. ", "We also saw strong sales gains driven by product innovation in our repair and shop management information business, Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 is our repair shop management information business in the RS&I group. We're seeing the benefits in that area from the investments we made over the past several years. We strengthened our offering for repair shop owners and managers with automotive-related products, with new heavy-duty truck applications and with new features like our customer retention programs that assist shop owners to better market to old and new customers. The high single-digit growth that Mitchell 1 during the quarter is evidence of that expanded credit. ", "Our repair information position will take another step forward this month when Mitchell 1 launches our new pro demand software. It enhances technician productivity by improving the speed and accuracy of search capabilities, as well as the navigation to other online information like wiring diagrams, technical service bulletins and schedule maintenance data. ", "With ProDemand, we're basically expanding the vocabulary of the system, harmonizing terminology across OEM badges, making it better able -- making the system better able to decipher what the technician needs and taking him to the solution faster. We've been trying the product with a broad base of technicians, and the initial reaction has been very positive.", "One more highlight related to RS&I. I already mentioned that our equipment business in Europe is fairly large, and the impact is evident in the overall growth rate for RS&I. We are, however, making great progress in emerging markets like Brazil and the Middle East, with the equipment business, where saw solid double-digit gains of undercar equipment. We launched a number of new products for those markets over the past several years, and we're seeing them pay off. ", "While that's the highlights. OpCo, operating margin expansion and FinCo continuing on-track with increased profits, a 7% organic growth, significant progress along our strategic runways even in the face of a difficult environment in Europe. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a financial review. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales in the first quarter of $735.2 million increased $41.5 million or 6% year-over-year. Excluding foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 7%, led by double-digit growth in Snap-on tools and across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets in critical industries. ", "Consolidated gross profit of $347.7 million in the quarter increased $17.1 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, gross margin of 47.3% was down slightly from 47.7% last year, primarily due to continued margin pressure in our European-based hand tools business, partially offset by contributions from RCI initiatives and $2.1 million at lower restructuring costs. ", "Operating expenses in the quarter of $250.2 million were up $6.9 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 34% in the quarter improved 110 basis points from 35.1% last year, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage in savings from RCI and restructuring initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by a higher stock-based mark-to-market and performance-based incentive compensation expense and $3.1 million of higher restructuring cost. ", "Operating earnings before Financial Services of $97.5 million in the quarter increased $10.2 million or 11.7% from 2011 levels. And as a percentage of sales, improved 70 basis points to 13.3%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $23.9 million in the quarter increased $11.4 million from 2011 levels, reflecting the continued growth of our on-book finance portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $121.4 million in the quarter increased 21.6%, and as a percentage of revenues, improve 180 basis points to 15.7% from 13.9% a year ago. Finally, net earnings of $71 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the quarter increased $14.8 million or 26.3% from last year's levels. ", "Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $286.5 million for the first quarter were up 6.4% organically from 2011 levels, primarily as a result of double digit sales increases across the majority of our businesses serving customers in emerging markets and critical industries. These increases were partially offset by a mid-single digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business, particularly as a result of further weakness in Southern Europe. ", "Gross profit of $102 million in the quarter decreased $1.6 million from 2011 levels, primarily due to continued margin pressure in our European-based hand tools business, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. As a result, gross margin of 35.6% in the quarter compared with 38% last year. ", "Operating expenses of $72.8 million in the quarter were up slightly from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.4% improved 100 basis points from 2011, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by $3.4 million of higher restructuring cost, primarily to improve the segment's cost structure in Europe. As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings of $29.2 million for the C&I segment declined $2.4 million or 7.6% from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 10.2% compared with 11.6% last year. ", "Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools group of $316.6 million, improved $34.6 million or 12.3%, largely due to continued higher sales in the United States. Gross profit of $139 million increased $14.1 million from 2011 levels, and as a percentage of sales, was 43.9% compared to 44.3% last year. ", "Gross margin last year benefited from favorable manufacturing utilization associated with the anticipated consolidation of the company's North American tools storage operations. Operating expenses of $92.9 million in the quarter increased $5.1 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 29.3% improved 180 basis points, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage.

As a percentage of sales, operating earnings of 14.6% compared with 13.2% a year ago. ", "Restructuring costs in the quarter were $2.6 million lower than last year. Excluding the effect of restructuring expense in both periods, operating income margin improved 50 basis points year-over-year. ", "Turning now to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $226.1 million increased 1% organically. As of mid-single digit sales gain of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products, primarily the independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit sales gain to OEM dealerships were partially offset by the lower sales of undercar equipment in Europe that Nick discussed in his remarks. ", "Gross profit of $106.7 million in the quarter increased $4.6 million from prior year levels. Gross margin of 47.2% in the quarter improved 220 basis points from 45% last year, primarily due to a more favorable sales mix, reflecting higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products, including the SOLUS Ultra mentioned earlier. Gross profit also benefited from savings associated with ongoing RCI initiatives. ", "Operating expenses of $58.1 million in the quarter decreased $1.2 million from 2011 levels. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses of 25.7% improved 40 basis points from 26.1% last year, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from sales volume leverage.

First quarter earnings from Financial Services of $23.9 million increased $11.4 million from prior year levels, primarily due to a continued growth in our on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $156.3 million in the quarter rose 7.3%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs. ", "Moving to Slide 11. As the first quarter end, our balance sheet includes $968 million of gross financing receivables, including $813 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $155 million from our international finance subsidiaries. ", "In the United States, $660 million or 81% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since 2011 year end, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $33 million. The pace of the portfolio's growth has continued as expected and is naturally decelerating as the transition of the CIT owned portfolio nears completion. In 2012, we continue to anticipate that the gross on-book portfolio will increase by approximately $125 million over 2011 year-end levels. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. ", "Now turning to Slide 12. Consolidated operating cash flow for the quarter was $65 million. This includes the decrease in accruals and other liabilities, comprised primarily of incentive compensation-related payments made during the quarter and the effect of a $25 million cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans, which included an $18.3 million required 2012 contribution and a $6.7 million discretionary contribution. In 2012, we also intend to make required contributions of $12.6 million to our foreign pension plans and, depending on market and other conditions, may make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. plans. As expected, free cash flow from Financial Services was a negative $35.1 million in the quarter, reflecting the continued funding of new loan originations at Snap-on Credit. The operating company generated positive free cash flow of $48.9 million in the quarter, representing a $46 million increase over the prior year. Capital expenditures of $21.8 million in the quarter included continued investments particularly in the United States and new product efficiency, safety and cost-reduction initiatives, as well as investments in new production and machine tooling. Capital expenditures also included continued spending to support our strategic growth initiatives including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in emerging growth markets. ", "As seen on Slide 13, day sales outstanding for trade receivables of 58 days was unchanged from 2011 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.4 million from 2011 year-end levels, excluding currency translation, inventories increased $4.1 million, primarily to support higher customer demand in the U.S. ", "On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory trends of 4x compared to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $162 million decreased $24 million from 2011 year-end levels, primarily due to the funding of new loan originations by Snap-on Credit, the previously discussed U.S. pension contribution, share repurchases of $29.9 million and dividend payments of $20.1 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated from operations. ", "Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 33.8% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $162 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. ", "As of first quarter year end, our first quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities. ", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now I will briefly comment on a few outlook items. ", "We continue to anticipate that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. Restructuring expenses in the second quarter of 2012 are expected to approximate $8 million, including the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the company's Newmarket, Canada facility. Finally, we also anticipated that our full year 2012 effective income tax rate will approximate 33.5%. ", "I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter. An encouraging period, strong volume growth, continuing credit company ramp up and more progress in driving increased profitability, and all of that was achieved in the face of European headwinds. We believe the quarter's performance represents, clear confirmation that our decisive runways for growth are wide and that we are advancing forward. The van network is being enhanced. Sales were up more than 12%, and franchisee health metrics are the best we've seen. ", "We are extending to critical industries. Our industrial division grew by double digits again. We are expanding with repair shops owners and managers. Our Diagnostics and Mitchell businesses grew nicely, and we are building an emerging market strong double digit again in places like China, India, Indonesia and Russia. The progress along each of these runways made our quarter and overcame imperfect economies. ", "Going forward, we believe we're well-positioned. We have momentum. And we will take advantage, full advantage, of the abundant opportunities that stretch out before us. ", "Before I close again this quarter, I think it's appropriate that I recognize the essential role of our franchisees -- that our franchisees and associates have played in our performance. I know many of you are listening, and I also know that this quarter's result is a direct result, is a direct reflection of your contribution. For your energy, for your support and for your commitment to this team, you have my thanks, and you have my congratulations. ", "Now I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Joe on the line for David. I think the most obvious surprise and it's a great quarter with the Tools Group growing 12%. Several straight quarters now that group has been putting up double-digit results. I'm just wondering if you can point to anything specific that might be driving that, because it's obviously well in advance of what some of your public peers are reporting for growth in their businesses.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think there's a couple of factors. One is that, as I've said, we kept investing during the downturn. We said that. We invested in the health of our franchisees, and they didn't take a step back during the downturn. They, in fact, got better and stronger. And I think coming out of that, we came out of the downturn with relative to others a strong, strong network. That's one. Two, we've been investing in innovation. If you've ever been here, you see the innovation works and you see the products were rolling out so they have attractive products. And then finally, as I said in my remarks, we've been spending time working on RCI in terms of Rapid Continuous Improvement and expanding the selling time. Only a -- not all of their day is spent on selling. And so this is a productivity opportunity for us, and we're working on that. I've said many times on the call, I think our call and then analyst meetings one-on-one that fully enabled our advance call on, maybe 800,000 technicians or 850,000 technicians and there are 1.3 million technicians in the United States. This is a product -- and they don't call on them because they're less target rich. This is a productivity opportunity. What you're seeing here is in effect that given our people more time to sell, more productivity advancements and, therefore, able to call on broader range of customers. And so you see those 3 effects: New products, stronger health and better productivity. And that's what's generating these double-digit gains.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So with the van count pretty much stable productivity has helped you increase coverage, is there an indication of how much more you can pull that lever to further revenue increases?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "This is -- you're right. This is same-store sales. It's a great -- it's an encouraging look. I don't want to speculate on that. I mean, I said that the numbers -- but the numbers -- when we had a first couple of quarters like this, I said, well, one quarter a trend does not make. But now the Tools Group has been putting together some pretty good quarters. I think their organic growth have been stuff like 9, 10 and 6 and 9 and 12, so they've been doing pretty well. So we think this has got some runway.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "The new trend is double-digits?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "But I -- but, no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't use -- I wouldn't say --", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Of course, yes.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "-- it is double-digit, of course. But I think we feel very good about the position the Tools Group is in. So without making any projection, I stick to my projection which says, we are looking to grow as a company at 4% to 6% organically, right, every quarter. And the Tools Group is a component of that.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sure. And then just on the C&I business, I think this is the first quarter that the military side of that business is in a headwind, and I'm just wondering with the organic growth going from 4.5%, 5% and now it's up about 6%, would 6% be a more sustainable pace of growth in that business if [indiscernible]", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, sure, we said that our growth range would be 4% to 6% organically, and we said that C&I would be toward the top end of that. And so this kind of lines right up with that, it's a little bit better than that actually. And you're right in saying that this military was not a headwind this time, but this is the critical -- military is part of the critical industry, the critical industry's piece of this business. And so you have -- and that's concentrated in our industrial division. And if you go back to our last call, you'll see this is the second quarter in a row, which the industrial business has been registering double-digit growth, which we view as confirmation of our assertion that we have runway in these critical industries. And so we think that the C&I group will be helped by that.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last one for me for Aldo. Can you say what the delinquency rates have been running at with portfolio?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Well, the delinquency rates are published on Chart 11. If what you're suggesting is the all-in bad debt rate that we sometimes talked to, again, it remains a favorable trend with these delinquency rates.", "Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So like around 3%?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "About 3.3%.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jim Lucas from Janney Capital Markets.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "A couple of things here. You've given a lot of good color, not just this quarter but over the past several quarters about the runways and how they continue to widen. Wanted to just delve a little bit into the Tools Group. In the past, you've talked a little bit about the makeup of bigger ticket items and demand there. And just curious what you're seeing in terms of the purchasing patterns of your customers if it's more toward the handheld, the software upgrades, the toolboxes or is it just really just the day-to-day?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, it's the mix by product. If you characterize it, let's say, big ticket tool storage, the big boxes and the big size diagnostics and so on all the way down to hand tools and so on, that mix hasn't changed for several quarters. It's been -- we use -- the big ticket have been reasonably strong and robust in those mixes, and they haven't really gone down or up within reasonable, what I would say, quarterly windage. And so I don't think we -- you'd see any trend inside there whatsoever. You could -- you see sometimes in the Tools Group as they reach out to other customers, you get a different mix within those groups, like if you sell more to heavy truck or somebody like that, you'll get different diagnostics and different hand tools and so on, so you get a different mix within the groups. But we haven't seen much change with regard to the dimension between big ticket and small tickets. It's pretty much been the same.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then if you -- if we take a step over to the C&I side on critical industries, are there any particular industries were you've been more successful? And conversely, are there others where you find you're not having as much traction? Just curious as to what is standing out there.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "If you look at the quarterly numbers, Jim, you'll get ups and downs every quarter. These businesses can be lumpy, so you get -- but if you step back and then look at it over the March and say 18 months or so on, I would say that we've been pretty strong in aerospace. We've been very good at that. I think we've been good in the military when the military has been positive, hasn't been so lumpy, and we haven't had these sort of political headwinds flowing through the military. So we've been strong in that critical applications. And those are the 2, I think, that we've been better at. Natural resources is very good for us at times and so on. And so I think those have been the improving areas for us.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And finally on Europe, I mean, undoubtedly that's going to continue to be a headwind. You've got some further cost actions that you're going to be taking. When you take a step back and you look at your competitive position in Europe, where you are today, what you're doing from a cost structure, is it really more just about playing defense until the headwinds subside? Can you just talk a little bit about how you manage through the current environment in Europe?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. First thing I'd say is we're not exactly wringing our hands over it. You go back and forth when you make comments on these calls and you want to say -- you want to make people aware of the issues in Europe and so on. But we don't -- we -- this isn't our first recession, our first downturn, of course. And so we're managing through this. And so what we see is our customers are still in place. We see our productivity and our RCI efforts creating opportunities for restructuring. We see our Asian factories ramping up to the point they get capability and so on, so they can support and provide even more capacity. So we're being proactive in the idea. We're bringing together the new capacity expansion we're seeing in Asia, and okay, looking to support Europe more in that. We're taking the RCI activities and tailoring the footprint to the current environment reflecting those RCI activities. So I think those 2 things are happening. And one -- so I wouldn't call it necessarily plan defense. I would say more or less saying we believe the market comes back. We believe our customers in place. We believe that the Bahco brand is still strong. And around that, we are tailoring the footprint to be as flexible as possible. So in future ups and downs, we're more -- we're less vulnerable to, let's say, variations in volumes. And then on top of that we're overlaying the idea that more capacity is coming online in the very flexible and growing capabilities in our Asian markets. And that will also create the kind of restructuring program around Europe. One of the things I do want to emphasize around our brand, one of the things that's encouraging to us there is that when you look at SNA Europe's primary brand Bahco, it's selling pretty well outside any -- when you're not talking about the core Europe, when you're talking about the periphery about Turkey and Russia and Middle East and so on, this brand is selling pretty well. So we're convinced there's nothing wrong with the product lines. It's still very strong and being well received, and we get our pricing there. It's just in those economics that are causing us the current challenges -- those economies that are causing us the current challenges, and remember that Spain is one of our, as you know, is one of our biggest area, was one of our biggest areas and the highest margin areas, and it's down substantially in the quarter.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just on the Snap-on Tools segment. I guess you realized a 12% organic growth, but gross margins were off about 40 basis points. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of what appeared to be disconnect there? And mindful that there was a comp issue here. In the first quarter '11, you had some manufacturing activities, I guess, that were influencing them. Can you quantify that for us?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I don't think we're going to quantify those, but I'll give it to you directionally. When you look at that, you're getting the -- I think we said in the 10-Q or maybe that there was a manufacturing unfavorable comp in terms of manufacturing because last year we're preparing for the consolidation of our tools storage business in the United States and Canada. So therefore, there were some better absorption positions despite the differences in volume in certain of the factories in the first quarter last year. And then the other piece of this is it depends on where you're talking about. The other piece of it is if you look in quarter-to-quarter, the first quarter is always lower because of -- is always past because of higher spending in the first quarter because of kick-offs and so on. And then the other factor, I think, is fair is that as we reach out to different customers, and remember, I said these are -- these were less target rich customers. You get a different mix of product lines that sell to those, and that can create a product line mix -- within a mix within product lines, that will give you some difficulty. And also, I mean, and my view is when you look back over time, the margins are kind of in line with the range of Tools Group anyway. But I think that's -- those are the sort of couple of effects this year as the thing we called out in terms of the year-over-year absorption that was very favorable last year. And secondly, the reach to different customers, which creates a little bit of different mix in some of our products. That's what happened in the Tools Group. The Tools Group. I know some people are worried about tougher comparisons sometimes as we go forward from time to time. But -- and it is. It will get tougher. It does get tougher. But this quarter in the U.S., the U.S. grew over 15% this quarter. That's a gang busters quarter.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "That's a great quarter.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "This business is doing pretty well, I think, so.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So I'm just trying to understand in your operating margins, you get 140 bps of improvement there. Does that just imply that you had a lot of RCI gains sort of bridging the relatively flat gross margin down to a reasonably good step up on the operating margin?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "In the Tools Group?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Just leverage.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, you get leverage. You get leverage in the Tools Group.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. What's normally the gross margin leverage that we should see absent all sorts of year-over-year comp issues that we're seeing this year, but what's the normal?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I hate to speculate on -- I hate to say that because it depends on -- I realize you'd like something like that to help modeling, but it really depends on the situational situation. Sometimes you can be selling products which you don't make. We can be using not everything we sell are of the brands we make. And so therefore, it depends on the mix of products. So it's very difficult to give you guidance in that regard.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. If I could just ask one other point. Just on the Financial Services business. What's a good number for originations going forward beyond 2012? Growth [indiscernible].", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "The growth in the Snap-on FinCo portfolio over time get more closely aligned with that of the Tools Group. So once the runoff of the CIT portfolio and the transition stops to occur, originations are more or less fall in line with the Tools Group growth pattern. You can always have a little bit of timing difference one quarter to the next, and it depends on the mix of what is sold in the way of big ticket items, because that tends to find its way onto credit contracts more readily than just hand tools. But over the long-term, it will reflect the growth of the Tools Group. As Nick characterized, while we're enjoying double-digit growth these days, over the longer run, it'll be probably something a little bit less than that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Aldo, should that convergence occur early in '13?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "I think you'll start to see 2013 become more normalized. At the end of this year, I mean, our estimates -- I think we've commented on this before, it will be probably about another $25 million or so of CIT-owned extended credit receivables will be managing on their behalf. So once we get down to that level, I think the crossover will become less.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Alek Gasiel, Barrington Research.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just sitting in for Gary. Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess one thing. I know, Nick, you talked in the past about -- just kind of curious again, what percentage of your territory is under penetrated by the van network? And has that changed recently?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, I don't -- generally, it kind of changed over time. We're not looking to -- I would say the addition of vans is not a major factor in our growth going forward. So we have probably as many vans -- it's not to say we won't add some, but the thing is I don't think that's going to be a major factor in the growth. The big thing about in terms of vans is how quickly we can replace them. Of course, we -- our turnovers are down. I believe at least a relatively -- a relative low and I think it might be an all-time low, but so -- but when somebody turns in his Van or somebody wants to retire and he sites to retire and he happens to do Northeast Peoria, you maybe don't have anybody in Northeast Peoria to go in there. So how quickly do we fill that? So how quickly do we get them in? How quickly to get somebody up? This is a factor, so we track that and we talk about that. That's something that can do -- that can go better, that we could do better. We've improved, so we can do better. And then, secondly, I said, we call on a group of technicians. There are some we don't call on because they are less target rich. They're either off the geographic center of our route or they're in tire shops, something like that, and as we get more productivity with our vans, give them more selling time available, they can choose to use this time to call on those people. That's part of the phenomena we're seeing in this growth. And so I would offer that the 2 of the runways for growth anyway with regard to the physical to the van have to do with getting a new guy in when another guy leaves, retires and then secondly, have the people get more selling time so they can reach out, reach more customers. And I guess if you have more selling time, you can schmooze the existing customers and sell them more. So those are the elements of growth.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "How fast is it to get a new guy running up, I mean, versus in the past?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It depends if we have a guy for the territory. Being as maybe we have trouble -- we might have 4 guys for, let's say, a garden spot, Kenosha, Wisconsin. We might have a lot of people for Kenosha, but we happen to live in here in Kenosha. Our headquarter is in Kenosha, so I'd say that. But we might have a lot of people for Kenosha, but we might not have many people for Peoria. I'm not sure -- it's come down. I don't actually have the statistics. If you like to get the statistics, we'll get them to you. If you call Leslie, she'll have it for you. Okay?", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And just one quick. I might have missed this. Just with Europe, and I know last quarter, you talked about how the softness and weakness in Southern Europe is now creeping into more mature area, which is evident now. Just kind of what you're seeing right now in the quarter, Q2 at the moment? If you can provide any color.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I don't think -- we can't. I can't speculate on that. If you read the same paper as I do, I think this is being driven economically. We're not sure. I think if you look at the GDP growth rates that are projected in Europe, a lot of them are flattish. Some of them are down. Our European businesses are down substantially, deeply in the south, mid-single digits in the sort of center, and in Eastern Europe, we're actually up a little bit. I think the important thing to think about for our businesses, if you look at the European business, and our European businesses in each of our groups, there's 10% in the Tools Group and some other percentage all the way up to about 1/3 or more of C&I. If you take those businesses and you isolate them, the rest of the business grew at double digits organically. So if you look at the place where we weren't organically -- we weren't economically afflicted, you're growing at, what, double-digits, and Europe represents a kind of challenged 20% to 25%. We used to say 25%. It's down now, because it shrunk a little bit, okay?", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Michael Prober from Clovis.", "Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP", "Could one of you talk about the acquisition environment and how the deal pipeline is? And then I have a follow-up.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, as I said, I think when I've spoken of this, we found that -- we say that we will look at acquisitions that will be in any of the 4 critical paths, our strategic runways for growth. I think you could argue that the Tools Group doesn't have so many acquisitions available to it. But in terms of emerging markets, in terms of repair systems and information and with repair shop owners and managers and with critical industries, there are businesses which would enhance our business and enhance our position that we could acquire bolt-on and allow us to continue to grow coherently. There are a number of those. And I think I've also said that we're still working -- we think we're still -- we're working through and just getting through the largest acquisition in our history, which was the credit company. So the idea that there is a -- we're working through that large acquisition. We have a pipeline -- I don't know, pipeline implies that you're going to go off and do them all. I don't really mean that, but we have a number -- a universe of possible candidates that we have out there in each of those segments, and so we keep -- we're looking at those and when the time is right, we'll take some actions.", "Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP", "I mean, the company really hasn't -- I know that credit card -- excuse me, credit division was a big acquisition. Credit company is a big acquisition, but that was really more of a financial integration than an operational integration because you were mostly...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, that's worth $800 million.", "Michael Aaron Prober - Clovis Capital Management, LP", "But it soaked up a lot of capital in the balance sheet and now the company is over capitalized by most measures. And I was just wondering if you're planning on spending capital after you build the balance sheet for the finance company in 2013, '14 on acquisitions? And are there any out there for you because it doesn't really look like there are that many out there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think there are acquisitions. I mean, I -- obviously, I don't want to talk about such things on the call, but I think a casual review of things available would say that there are acquisitions that would be available. We may not have -- in fact, there has been acquisitions available, which we may not have moved at for a variety of reasons. So I think there clearly are acquisitions. If you look at the automotive space around repair shops -- repair shop owners and managers, there've been a couple of properties passed. We viewed it, and we didn't -- we weren't the acquirer. And then there are critical industries. There are a lot of product lines, which we could add to our product lines smear the Snap-on patina above it and make positive things. In emerging markets, there are places to acquire.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. And I will turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our third quarter 2012 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of the slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. The slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start today's call with highlights of the quarter's results. I'll provide my perspective on the operations and on our various markets around the world then Aldo will cover the financials in more detail.", "The results in the quarter were encouraging again. EPS of $1.26 and our organic sales increase of 4.6% from last year. Performance from our operating company or OpCo, as we call it, was strong with 13.5% operating margin. And as expected, Financial Services also had expanded profitability, growing its on-book portfolio. FinCo OI of $27.9 million was up from the $20.8 million of last year. And I believe that all of these are encouraging absolutes.", "As we highlighted on our release, there is a year-over-year comparison impact that results from the substantial movements in our share price in the third quarters of both last year and in this year. As a result of the related mark-to-market effects, this year, there was an unfavorable $4.4 million adjustment. Last year's third quarter included a favorable $7.8 million mark-to-market adjustment. Absent this $12.2 million unfavorable swing, our OpCo operating margin in the quarter increased 170 basis points from 2011 levels, an encouraging apples-to-apples rise.", "Now the sales increase in the quarter came against clear headwinds. Those gains generally represent a continuation of the same progress we've been registering over the past few periods. We're not really seeing much change in the overall market dynamics. Europe, for sure, remains tough. It's our most significant challenge and it has been for some time. And we also have other headwinds, I'll speak about those in a moment in the segment discussion. But when you operate in diverse geographies and markets, there will always be some challenges. Our strengths though, are more than overcoming those headwinds, with a clear focus on the 4 areas we've  identified as being decisive for our future: building in emerging markets, extending into critical industries, enhancing the franchise network and expanding our presence in the repair garage. We're making progress in each of those areas and you can see it in the results.", "Along with the growth, you're also seeing improved performance that's being authored by what we call the Snap-on Value Creation Processes. We drive them every day: safety, quality, customer connection, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, and innovation. These disciplines of improvement are a powerful set of tools. They are enabling our progress. And I do just want to touch a little deeper on 2 of the most important components of Snap-on Value Creation: innovation and customer connection.", "Snap-on was founded on innovation more than 90 years ago, and we've continued and expanded on that tradition through the decades. It's evident in our brands. Of course, in the Snap-on name, the symbol of pride for professionals but it also extends to brands like Bahco, the first in the world to offer adjustable wrenches and on our John Bean brand, a legacy rooted in the first wheel aligner. And that innovation is enabled by the significant advantage we have in customer connection with 4,800 franchisees around the world and the hundreds in our direct sales force, we reach into 600,000 repair shops in the U.S. and Europe and into countless workplaces of other types. And with that presence, we observe work and make it easier. You can see that innovation and customer connection coming together in the Wisconsin lab that we call Innovation Works. We use that facility to bring technicians in, our engineers and designers watch them work, get them engaged and we develop new products to make them more productive. It's an active place, it's had more than 12,000 visitors in last -- in 2.5 years since it's been opened -- and it's a great demonstration of customer connection and innovation in action, and it's driving results.", "You can see innovation supported by customer connection in our new offerings. Just recently, we launched several new products in our Power Tools line, like the extension of our successful CTS family of compact tools, with more power than ever before, new impacts and new drills. And also, our new pneumatic ratchet, the longest available for greater accessibility and the fastest for increased productivity. These were big contributors in the quarter.", "Innovation and customer connection also play out in the recognition that our products receive. Snap-on was just awarded 3 Top 20 tool awards by MOTOR Magazine for 2012. Almost at the same time, Professional Tool & Equipment News recognized an additional 2 Snap-on products, citing them for extraordinary innovation.", "We believe that these awards clearly demonstrate the success we're having in using our unique customer connection and turning those ideas into successful, new, innovative products. And as our results show, this does drive sales.", "Now let's have some discussion about the segments. In the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, organic sales in the quarter were up 4% from last year's level and the operating margin of 11.9% was up a strong 130 basis points. The story here is much the same as the second quarter, Europe being the biggest macro headwind had a significant impact on C&I by way of our European hand tool business, SNA Europe. That business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, with particular weakness in the South, in places like Spain, which is a big market for us. Outside of that operation, our progress in serving customers in critical industries and in the emerging markets of Asia, along with a particular strength in power tools as a result of those new products, were able to more than offset the SNA Europe impact.", "Speaking of Asia Pacific, we saw encouraging growth there again in the third quarter, high single-digits overall. We often speak of India and China, but at this quarter, Indonesia and Thailand deserve special mention. They performed quite well, contributing to the overall results. With respect to product, our undercar equipment and hand tool lineups led the growth in our Asian markets. And as I said in our last call -- but it's worth repeating -- undercar equipment is an important, high-visibility, high-value product line. It allows us to clearly showcase our advantage, and our advantage is in innovation. That's a feature of great importance in growing our position in Asia Pacific and it's working for us. Critical industries are already largely served -- are also largely served in the C&I group through our industrial division. And that operations has headwinds of its own, areas of restricted government spending like the military, which is weak due to troop withdrawals and the overall funding constraints. On the other hand, gains in serving customers in the critical aerospace and the natural resources sectors more than offset that military challenge. Actually, the overall industrial growth was one of the key factors in C&I posting a reasonable gain in spite of the European and military headwinds.", "Let's move to the Tools Group. Double-digit gains again, up 11.1% from last year, with an operating margin of 13%. I believe that kind of growth in the current environment clearly reflects the strength of our franchise network. It's evident in the detailed statistics we call franchisee health metrics. We monitor them closely and I'll tell you that franchisee sales and profits are up, route turnover is low and so are the delinquency rates at Snap-on Credit. And the strength and the enthusiasm in the network could be seen in the quarter when we held our Annual Franchisee Conference -- record attendance and orders. That event serves many purposes. It's part training session, part new-product and tools shows and part pep rally. It's a reunion of professionals where we get a good feeling for the business at the grass roots level. And discussions I had with franchisees were very positive, positive both on the current conditions and positive on their prospects for their future. An important part of our progress is that we're working closely, more closely than ever with our franchisees to improve their business. Consider that 4 of those 5 awards from MOTOR Magazine and Professional Tool & Equipment News enabled the tools group.", "Many our new power tools were developed specifically for automotive technicians. We have the traveling tool fair we call the Masters of Metal Tour, which I spoke of last quarter, and we are expanding our fleet of new Rock 'n Roll Cabs specifically -- specially outfitted trucks filled with tool storage units, aimed at driving those big-ticket sales. That effort helped drive increases for tool storage at rates well beyond the overall Tools Group growth. And those sales are also aided by our wholly-owned credit company. Snap-on Credit focuses precisely on supporting those big-ticket transactions and it's a real advantage for us and for our franchisees.", "We also have teams of people working to improve franchisees' productivity, finding ways to make their business easier, stronger and more profitable. All of these initiatives are coming together and it's clear that they're achieving ongoing gains.", "Now to Repair Systems & Information Group or RS&I. This is where we primarily serve automotive repair shop owners and managers. Organic sales in RS&I were up 2.7% and the operating margin of 22.3% expanded by 270 basis points. The relatively modest overall growth rate, I think, requires some explanation because the market dynamics across the different businesses vary quite a bit. Our strength in expanding our presence in the independent repair shops is clear but it's being muted somewhat by lower activity with the OEMs and by the impact of Europe. We do continue to see solid gains, high single digits in repair information and diagnostic units for the independent shop technicians, owners and managers. And we appear to be gaining position, driven by new products like Mitchell 1's ProDemand repair information software and also with an array of popular handheld diagnostic units. In fact, our SOLUS Ultra, a groundbreaking diagnostic unit, is one of the products that was just recognized by MOTOR Magazine. And we're keeping that momentum expanding and going. At this year's franchisee conference, we also launched the VERUS PRO, setting a new industry standard for top-of-the-line units, enhanced diagnostics capabilities, faster performance and a thinner design, and the reception has been strong.", "On the other hand, we continue to see lower activity with the automotive OEMs, especially in Europe. Last year, we had some fairly large European programs that are now winding down. That's the nature of that business and we believe the overall negative macroeconomics in Europe are creating reluctance by the OEMs to launch new programs, making for some weakness in this already uneven segment. Speaking of Europe, our RS&I does have a sizable presence in that region with undercar equipment. Now the past several quarters, I've mentioned the business being down in the mature markets of Western Europe, no surprise, given the troubled environment. And while that area was down again mid-single digits, our overall undercar business was up from last year's level, based on the growth in North America, in Russia and in Brazil. So the overall comparisons in the Undercar business were somewhat better than the past few quarters. And that's also been aided by new offerings. In fact, our John Bean Integrity Test Drive system was another one of the products recognized by the MOTOR Top 20. This is a unique system, and it highlights several of our capabilities from diagnostics to alignment that we brought together in the RS&I group. The Integrity performs a complete vehicle inspection in just minutes. It checks alignment, the battery, the brakes and the diagnostics code and it generates a condition report that helps greatly in communicating with the customer right in the shop. We're excited about this product and it's winning awards and it certainly does make the technician's work easier.", "Well, those are the highlights of the quarter. Organic sales gain of 4.6%, in our range of expected growth; OpCo margin increase of 170 basis points after adjusting for the impact of mark-to-market; FinCo continuing its profit increase and clear evidence of progress along our strategic runways for improvement and for growth. All in all, another encouraging quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales totaled $711.6 million, representing an organic sales increase of 4.6%. This increase included positive organic growth in each of our operating segments. Consolidated gross profit of $340.4 million increased $11.1 million from 2011 levels and gross margin of 47.8% improved 60 basis points from 47.2% last year, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives, including benefits from restructuring. Operating expenses of $244.2 million were up $9.2 million from last year. As a result of the increase in the quarter-end Snap-on stock price, operating expenses in the third quarter included an unfavorable $4.4 million of stock-based mark-to-market expense.", "Last year, you may recall, operating expenses in the third quarter were partially offset by $7.8 million of benefit from mark-to-market as a result of a decrease in the Q3 2011 quarter-end stock price.", "The operating expense margin of 34.3% in the quarter increased 60 basis points from 2011 levels, as favorable sales volume leverage was more than offset by the $12.2 million or 170 basis points of higher mark-to-market expense.", "Restructuring cost totaled $2.3 million in the quarter compared to $2.9 million last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services of $96.2 million increased $1.9 million year-over-year despite the $12.2 million of higher mark-to-market expense. As a percentage of sales, operating margin of 13.5%, including the adverse 170 basis points impact from higher mark-to-market expense, was unchanged from last year.", "Operating earnings from Financial Services of $27.9 million increased $7.1 million or 34.1% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $124.1 million in the quarter increased $9 million over last year's levels, and the operating margin of 16.5% improved 70 basis points from 15.8% a year ago.", "Finally, third quarter net earnings of $74.1 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $67.8 million or $1.16 last year.", "Now let's turn to our segment results.", "Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I group on Slide 7. Third quarter sales of $280.4 million were up 4% organically from 2011 levels. This growth resulted primarily from mid to high single-digit sales increases in the businesses serving customers in critical industries and in the emerging markets of Asia, coupled with a double-digit increase in sales of Power Tools. These increases were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in our European-based hand tool business as a result of continued market weakness, particularly in Southern Europe.", "Gross profit totaled $103.7 million with gross margin of 37%, improving 10 basis points from last year. Operating expenses of $70.3 million decreased $2.9 million from 2011 levels and the operating expense margin of 25.1% improved 120 basis points from 2011 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and RCI initiatives.", "As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings of $33.4 million for the C&I segment increased 12.8% from 2011 levels and the operating margin of 11.9% improved 130 basis points from 10.6% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $308.8 million increased 11.1% organically, reflecting double-digit sales increases in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $131.3 million increased $6.1 million from 2011 levels. Gross margin of 42.5% in the quarter declined 230 basis points from 44.8% last year, primarily due to increased promotional programs associated with sales gains, including expanded participation at this year's Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference.", "Operating expenses totaled $91.1 million and the operating expense margin of 29.5% in the quarter improved 260 basis points from 32.1% last year, largely due to sales volume leverage. Operating earnings of $40.2 million in the quarter for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $4.6 million or 12.9% from last year's levels and the operating margin of 13% increased 30 basis points from 12.7% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Third quarter sales of $222 million increased 2.7% organically, primarily due to a high single-digit increase in sales of diagnostics and Mitchell 1 repair information products and a mid single-digit increase in worldwide sales of equipment. These increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in Europe. Gross profit totaled $105.4 million, with gross margin of 47.5%, increasing 200 basis points from 45.5% last year. This improvement is primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, as well as a more favorable sales mix that included higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products.", "Operating expenses totaled $55.9 million with the operating expense margin improving 70 basis points to 25.2%, reflecting sales volume leverage and contributions from RCI. Third quarter operating earnings of $49.5 million for the RS&I group increased $5.8 million or 13.3%. And the operating margin improved 270 basis points year-over-year to 22.3%.", "Now turning to Slide 10. Third quarter earnings from Financial Services increased $7.1 million, primarily due to the growth of the on-book finance portfolio. Originations of $179.6 million in the quarter rose 17.7%, reflecting both higher sales in our Snap-on Tools segment and increased participation in our credit programs.", "Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes $1.06 billion of gross financing receivables, including $893 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $714 million or 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Since the beginning of 2012, our on-book financing portfolio has grown approximately $128 million. Approximately $108 million of the expanded portfolio relates to the U.S., while $20 million is associated with our international finance subsidiaries, including $6 million of positive currency effect. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the worldwide finance portfolio will grow by an additional $20 million. Regarding finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Third quarter cash provided by operations of $69.7 million in 2012 increased $27.7 million from prior year levels and includes the effect of $16 million of additional third quarter discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans.", "This contribution is in addition to $26.7 million of discretionary contributions made earlier this year. Depending on market and other conditions, we may elect to make additional discretionary cash contributions to our U.S. pension plans. Capital expenditures totaled $19.7 million in the quarter and $59.5 million year-to-date. We anticipate full-year capital expenditures will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million, including the construction of a fourth factory at our Kunshan China location, which is expected to be completed by year end.", "As seen on Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 59 days compare to 58 days as of 2011 year end. Inventories increased $31 million from 2011 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher demand largely in the United States. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.8x compare to 4.2x at 2011 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $176 million decreased $9.5 million from year-end levels, primarily due to the continued year-to-date funding of new loans originated by Snap-on Credit, U.S. pension contributions of $61 million, share repurchases of $61.8 million, capital expenditures of $59.5 million and dividend payments of $59.4 million. These year-to-date uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations.", "Our net debt to cap ratio of 31.9% compares to 34.3% at 2011 year end. In addition to our $176 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. As of quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.", "This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's Snap-on's third quarter. Clear progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, overcoming the turbulence of Europe and the general economic uncertainty. Snap-on value creation is driving improvement. Our innovation and customer connection processes are combining to create product excitement and real customer value. And when combined with RCI, they enable progress. Adjusted for mark-to-market, OpCo OI margin rose significantly. And we are moving forward along our runways for growth, recording solid organic gains. Those results confirm that our efforts are paying off in each of the 4 areas we've identified as decisive for our future. Consider the quarter's performance, building in emerging markets -- we had strong gains in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Russia. Extending into critical industries -- we saw significant growth in sectors like aerospace and natural resources, overcoming the challenges in the military and offsetting the weaknesses of Europe. Expanding in the repair garage -- diagnostics and repair information up strongly in independent garages, more than balancing the unevenness in the activity with the OEMs. And undercar equipment sales in Russia and in Brazil and in North America, overcoming the ongoing challenges due to the European macros. Enhancing the franchise network, double-digit gains in the U.S. for the ninth straight quarter. An enthusiastic network that showed up in greater numbers than ever before at our Annual Franchise Conference, celebrating their success, while training to further improve their businesses. That's thousands of small business owners, energetic, invested and optimistic. Optimistic about their place on the Snap-on runway for growth.", "Yes, there are challenges but just like past periods, Snap-on's progress in the areas of opportunity have overcome the difficulties and achieved a favorable balance. And because of that, we are encouraged and clearly confident. Encouraged by the ongoing results and confident of our possibilities for growth and improvement as we move forward.", "Before I close, I want to recognize our associates and franchisees. Many of you, I know, are listening. I know that third quarter results and the favorable trends reflect your effort, your capability and your commitment to our team. For all of that, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to start on the Snap-on Tool business, in particular, international. You have got a great track record under your belt here in the U.S. with the performance there. That double-digit gain in the international breaks the trend there of low single-digits for a long time. Can you talk about what specifically on the international side has changed that and whether that's something that is sustainable going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "We think it is. Well, I don't know. Double digits I -- even though we've had a run of double-digits, David, I think I've been pretty consistent on these calls to say I'm not sure that kind of -- I would say, stratospheric -- growth can continue, but I think the strength in those places are pretty solid. The U.K. has improved substantially in the last, I would say, over the last couple of quarters and that is driving this. We've made great strides forward in terms of improving our product line and our relationship -- productivity with our franchisees there. Australia has been contributing quite well. And Canada has been very strong. We've actually spent a lot of time and a lot of focus, maybe off-camera a little bit, focusing on those areas and what you're seeing is the result of that focus, doing the same kinds of things adjusted for the -- that we did in the United States -- adjusted for the local market. So it\u2019s a sum of Canada, U.K. and Australia all doing better.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the U.S. side, in terms of the sustainability, the track record you put there, could you characterize at all? I mean obviously market share is a piece of that, but between market share, kind of deeper market penetration areas you haven't been, the product offering, can you put those into buckets of the contribution to that great performance in the U.S. at all?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. I don't think I can actually. But there clearly are 2 elements of it. One is we are, because of our new ways of marketing, able to sell more to the same customers. I think the idea of the traveling -- the idea of the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, and I think we're at the end of the quarter, we're at 28, we're going to go upwards almost -- we're going to expand that quite a bit going forward and -- because they've been so successful. So that's clearly a kind of wrinkle on the Van business in allowing us to sell more to pretty much our existing customers. Then on top of that, as I've said often, we are calling on more customers because our vans are becoming more productive and our product line is becoming wider and appealing to them. I can't put those into buckets. And I hate to talk market share because it's a very imprecise exercise when you're talking about tools and you start to have such a wide universe of possible products, it's very difficult to describe. I do think though, we're making great gains in the Tools group now. It's clear, after 9 quarters of double-digits, the Tools Group team has got this businesses, which is one of the world's great businesses, I think. That team has got this business resonating.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "[indiscernible] with the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, do you think you're getting folks to buy more products than they normally do buy or are they buying it at Snap-on instead of at Sears or Lowe's?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think there's both of those things. I think we think they're buying it from us as opposed to possibly, other places. But there's both of those things. I mean, David, as you know, it's like a new car purchase. All of a sudden, we now have showrooms in the field as opposed to catalogs. And so that's generally it. You were buying the thing, they were buying the thing from more or less from a catalog and now, they have showrooms. And you can think about how that excites people and it wins customers and it also accelerates the buy from some people. I mean, I think that some people probably are buying toolboxes, already have Snap-on toolboxes, they see a new one, they say boy, I can't live without that one, I'm going to have it. And then the other people were competitors and they see what the quality offerings we have. And we believe we have some really great offerings that are superior to the competitors based on innovation and they're coming over to our side. But I can't tell you how much -- which is which.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just while we are on the topic of storage, with that organic growth of 11.1%, how much of that was storage?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Well, I don't like to talk about that, but -- to give those numbers, but -- in that detail -- but I will tell you that the tools storage product line grew substantially higher than the 11% of the U.S. business or the overall tools business -- if it gives you any view.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And is there any way for us to think about that? I mean, you talked about 28 showrooms that I guess, we can call them and you're going to growth that. At what rate does that grow and how does the productivity from that grow?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know. I mean, that will be too precise for -- I'm not smart enough to say that, I think. I think it's like this, I believe that every one we add gets more sales. At least as far as we can see now, that's why we're doing this, that's why we're doing it. But, but, but we'll keep doing it until we see diminishing returns, I believe. So far, we haven't seen anything in the way of diminishing returns.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "That makes sense. Well, congratulations on the success of that program. You talked in the C&I business about pricing being up mids to high single digits. I was just wondering, my guess is probably not a lot that was in Europe, although maybe I'm wrong, but can you just help us understand how that experience might have played out over critical industries versus emerging markets?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Say that again. You mean...", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "The pricing in the C&I, you said was up mid to high single digits, I'm just wondering across those 3 businesses -- my guess is there's not a lot in Europe, but maybe I'm wrong on that. But can you talk about pricing, critical industries versus emerging markets?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sales were up. Sales were up mid single-digits. That's a component of our emerging market growth. Emerging markets are now about 10% of our business and critical industries are a significant piece of that. I'd say that -- let me see if I can help in this way. The C&I Group grew at about 4%, the emerging markets, which is about 10% of our total business, which is mostly in C&I grew close to double digits.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Maybe I could follow up with you offline on that. Then on the RS&I business, you said there was a high single-digit increase in the diagnostics and Mitchell 1 business, I know you've got a lot of innovation and new product in that business right now. Was there anything there last quarter or is this all just sort of emerging...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually let's -- for government work, the RS&I business looks sort of the same as last quarter in mix. Mitchell 1, the Repair Systems & Information business was up sort of right close to double digits. In fact, I think it was just over the double-digit boundary and that's the Repair Information business driven by what I call ProDemand repair information software. It's a new offering which has more information and the navigation is much simpler than anybody else's anymore. So it's a very attractive offering, combining state-of-the-art navigation with the best database available and people are lining up to subscribe to that. So that business has been growing pretty well and the diagnostic business -- and that happened last quarter, too, happened last quarter.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Nick, does it accelerate into the fourth quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Accelerate, I don't know. But I think we feel encouraged by our prospects there. I think we feel positive about our position looking at independent garages. The diagnostics business, I was going to say that's the handheld, the software, the hardware and software business, the laptops for cars grew at mid or high single digits. And those have been the same for a couple of quarters, give or take, a few basis points. So I don't know, I mean, we don't really give guidance but we feel good about our position.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "That sounds great. And the last question, just on the tools business, aside from the storage business, I was just wondering if you could talk about trends and big-ticket sales off the truck?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Looks okay. I think it looks okay. I mean, that's one of the things we always watch. So I suppose the operative question is this, is that, are you seeing downturn in big-ticket which would precursor maybe a cooling off of everything? And I don't think we do. Now you might say well, do you have visibility because you've got this new marketing program and are you able to pierce the veil of the marketing program to see what's actually happening in what I call just a pre-demand type activity in the marketplace? And I think we can and I don't think we see a downturn.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mike Wherley with Janney Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Obviously, the Tools Group has been very strong for many quarters now, and I'm just wondering do you -- when you're looking forward 1 quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, when do you feel like there might be some tough comps that are going to be difficult for your business to sort of keep the growth going? I mean, not that it's going to grow at double digits, but might it flatten out altogether if you run into tough comps?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, look, I think we've said in many forums that we expect to grow as a corporation, 4% to 6% organically. I didn't mean by that, that we would do it every quarter, although we have been able to do it most quarters. I think probably, almost all quarters -- but we feel confident of our ability to keep growing at that rate. I'm not saying we'll do it every quarter, I mean, that's not what I mean. But I mean, if you're talking about the trend, we feel okay about that. Yes, the comps get tougher, but they got tougher last year and the year before that and the year before that. So I don't think we're so worried about that. Now it's a challenge, but we're not wringing our hands over it.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. What about the -- just sort of thinking about it this way, just to be devil's advocate. If you're talking about selling more to the same customers and you're talking about this Rock 'n Roll Cab Express that's selling big-ticket items, that maybe some of these wouldn't have bought if this Cab Express didn't roll into their garage. I'm wondering now, at what point does selling more to the same people lead to a smaller wallet in the future?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I mean, well, I don't think it leads to a smaller wallet but it might lead to people who have used up their capacity to, you might say, it's led to their people -- people to use up their capacity to buy. I don't think we've seen the bottom of that yet. I don't think we believe we've seen the bottom of that yet. But it's a reasonable point, as you lay out over distance, but what you have there is a couple of things. First is, is underlining this business, repair is a good solid business. Every quarter for a number of quarters, the household spending on automotive repair has been up. So the underlying demand is good. By the way, that's in independent shops and so our core customer is growing and getting more business, that's number 1.  Number 2 is we keep -- the cars keep changing, we keep changing the products, they can see ways -- I was just out on a van on Monday, I was out on a van on Monday and you can see these guys talk to you. They say, gee could you get me -- it's like customer connection. You go there and they say, I need a special tool to help me pull this engine so I can do some work on it because this particular vehicle has some particular geometry, and if I do that, I can make more money. So part of the key here is every time they pay, every time they give us money, they make more money. So the more they spend with us, the better they -- the more money they make. So there's a kind of offset to the idea of the wallet reaches an end, that's 1. And not just from attenuation [ph] but 2, we have said that there are customers out there that we don't call on. Maybe they were Matco customers for a time, maybe they were Mac customers, maybe they were geographically undesirable, maybe they were in places that weren't target-rich and because we have more productivity and a wider product line, we are going to them and that's going on here too. So I'm optimistic about the Tools Group possibilities. Now, I'm not here to sign up for continuous double-digit growth though, in the Tools Group. I think I said, I'm signing up for 4% to 6% for the total corporation over time. We feel confident about this.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "But do you think the Tools Group can sustain something higher than what you've said? Can it sustain 5% to 6% on its own?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "They're starting to make me look dumb, aren't they? But I still say I like our other businesses. I like the opportunities of C&I to grow at the high end of that. I like RS&I, we're seeing a particular time when they are muted by Europe, 33% of C&I is in Europe, 17% of it is in Southern Europe. All right? And it's still growing at 4%. 25% of RS&I is in Europe and we got the OEMs kind of nervous and so we got this lumpy business. So I see the opportunities of those businesses to grow.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with MorningStar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions here on my end. In the European market, obviously, the U.K., new car sales are doing pretty well there. I would imagine that they're not experiencing some of the economic issues that the mainland Europe is experiencing, aftermarket probably isn't doing quite as bad there either and so I was wondering if you could kind of compare and contrast between the two. And also, in Europe, it seems to me like the European downturn is harsh enough that we're going to see consumers postponing aftermarket repairs for quite some time. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the correlation between when we start -- when should we start to see the aftermarket coming back, when people would start making repairs again versus when you see new-car sales start to improve coming out of an economic trough?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's tough. But I'll say this. For my money, for my money, there's no correlation between new car sales and our business. We don't see that, really. I think, to the extent that new car -- I suppose you could say that to the extent new car sales go down, we may see a slight burst. But generally, the thing is, in the U.K., as in the United States, what are new cars sales in the United States? This year they're forecasted at 15.2 million or something like that, well there's -- North America, rather. There are 300 million vehicles on the road. So new car sales are kind of like a blip in the after -- I think driving our aftermarket business anyway. So we don't really see it that way. It is true though, you are right though, that the U.K. is a stronger market. We found it to be uniformly for all our businesses and this is businesses both in automotive repair and critical industries, to be a better market for us than the rest of the -- than the continent, for sure. And so, we were kind of cautiously positive about that view. And I don't know if that continues or not, I think part of it is that people in the U.K. -- I think people don't necessarily postpone repair, I think they postpone new purchases. So I don't really see a downturn in repair there so much. Now remember, in Europe, our businesses are broader-based than in the United States so we have less of the business in automotive repair and more in the industrial and other places like agriculture. So we're more broadly based in terms of vertical industries in Europe. So you got to take that into account. Now, if you say the rest of Europe and when is it going to recover and when are people going to start spending again? I'd give you two thoughts, I think the South -- in fact, I'll just say traditional Europe, Western Europe, I'm not making any predictions. On one of these calls, I said once that Spain, I thought, had hit the bottom. Well, that was wrong and that was like 2 years ago. So I don't think anybody can actually predict this. All we can say for sure is our base customer base. Our base customer base seems to be intact so we believe it comes back. Now if you talk about the periphery of Europe, if you talk about Eastern Europe, you talk about Turkey, you talk about Maghreb countries, those businesses by and large, they have their ups and downs in every quarter, by and large, they've been pretty good for us. I don't know if that helps you any but I get -- in summary, I think the U.K. is okay and reasonable. I think nobody knows what's going to happen in Continental Europe, and I think the periphery is pretty good.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just the follow-on to an earlier question about the same size wallet, putting out more for additional tools. It seems to me like part of that, that you have to figure into that equation is the advancement of technology over time. For example, Nissan is talking about launching within the next year, Drive-by-Wire in its Infiniti brand. This is going to the first mass-produced use of this technology and that means that the tools and the diagnostics and things that are going to be needed to work on that kind of thing in the garage are going to have to change and you're going to have to come out with new tools. So it seems to me like the kudos that you're getting from the industry magazines all the time and industry studies being done and the drive from the innovation that you do is part of getting that additional amount for the same set of garages that you're already in. You mentioned also earlier in the call, how you have the research that you do there in Wisconsin where you're bringing in people and you're observing them working on vehicles, do you do that kind of thing and is the innovation is as strong over the European market because obviously, you've got a different product set over there that you have to deal with versus what's here in the States.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, we do it in Europe and in places but the landscape in Europe, for example, our share of automotive repair is much larger in the U.K. than it is say, Germany or say, Sweden. So we do it. If you're talking about the garage and our observation in the garage, U.K., that model is pretty good, but we don't have a center like we do here. But let me offer this, is that the big customer connection flow, the information flow is not really in Innovation Works. Innovation Works is where we brought observations together with product design closer than ever before. But the by and large -- the blocking and tackling of innovation and customer connection, is every day when the franchisees and our salesmen go into garages and factories and repair facilities and see how things are working, that's how it happens, more than just having it here. And we have that in U.K. Now, what you said about innovation and change, this is our bread and butter because if you think about it, just think about hand tools, we guarantee hand tools for life. So if we didn't have -- if there weren't requirements, different requirements, we wouldn't have a business. So for 9 decades, we've been staying -- we've been having a business based on just the very kind of innovation you described. Nissan changes their cars, we got the best tools.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. Last area I wanted to talk a little bit about was credit and I was wondering if, first of all, if you could give a little bit more details on the increase in delinquencies, is that Europe and because of the economic conditions over there or something else causing that? And was also curious is how do you handle the differences between -- credit is a very legislated industry and you've got some major differences now between the U.S. and Europe and how do you look at the policies for the 2? How are they distinguished? And in the U.S., with the consumer protection agency now getting really ramped up into more full activity, is there anything coming along there on the credit side that you're going to have to look at when it comes in terms of your policies for setting credit out in the field?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Richard, Aldo here. Let me just jump in and take -- I'll take the easier one of your questions first and that's -- let's talk about delinquencies. Actually the delinquency trends have a seasonal element to them and they're tracking right where we expect them to be in a favorable manner. They will tend to run up slightly up until after the Christmas holidays and when people start getting their tax refunds back in March -- I'm not making this up, you'll see that we usually get a trend that starts to go in other direction. So the trends, if you look back over prior years, it's fairly consistent with our expectations. So if you go back to the quarter Q3 of last year, they were exactly 1.4% as well. So that's a good point. Your questions regarding compliance, sure. Watching compliance is a complicated area and we keep our eyes open but I want to remind you, we are commercial lenders and we strive to be interpreted as such under whether they be state regulations, a U.S. government regulations or are the same in other fields of -- other country operations. And again, there's always new compliance, rules and regulations on the horizon. We do our best to stay abreast of that. We feel we do a good job of complying with that. Should we add some incremental expenses to deal with that, we go with -- we pay that as we go. So we feel pretty comfortable that yes, it's an area that will continue to see more regulation and we're prepared to deal with it accordingly as it comes up.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alek Gasiel from Barrington Research.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of things. Gary -- I'm sitting in for Gary, but kind of getting back to the whole promotional thing in the Tool group, are you able to actually substitute that for the under -- for areas that the van are under-penetrated in? Or is that...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, that's not -- I don't think that really is how it happens. One of the things, we did have more promotions in the quarter in the Tools group, but one of the things that -- one base knowledge that's useful, I think, in this is every month, every week, in fact, we have promotions throughout the Tools group. It's part and parcel with the activity there. It's kind of an excitement builder that rolls through. And so fundamentally, what happened in the Tools group is basically, we're more active in promotions in the quarter. Some of that had to do with the SFC, the Franchisee Conference, where it's kind of the most exciting promotions are sometimes there. We had more people at the Franchisee Conference than ever before, the take-up rate was high and the promotions we offered there, and so that tended to drive some of that increase. That's really it. Those weren't aimed at reaching out to other new technicians or anything like that. The reaching out is more a productivity issue, actually.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Are you seeing an increase of people wanting to sign up to be franchisees now?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think we are but we're being very selective. We're not looking to increase the franchise. I mean, you will see the odd franchise, I think we probably went up 1 or 2 vans this quarter and so that happens. We're being very selective and we're happy with the people we're getting. What we're trying to do is make sure -- try to make sure we can anticipate who wants to retire and match up a person in that jurisdiction at that time. That's really the trick now, is to reduce the time to open. We eventually get a guy, but we want to reduce the time. And so, you can appreciate if somebody wants to -- if the franchisee in Tuscaloosa, Alabama wants to retire, you got to have a guy in Tuscaloosa. A guy in Des Moines doesn't help you and so we're working on that now.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And you commented about the muted OEM dealers particularly in Europe. I wonder if you could provide any color on North America. What are you seeing...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "What I meant by that, if I said OEM dealers, I didn't mean that. I meant OEM manufacturers. What happens is, is that in that particular business, the OEM manufacturers decide to commission an essential tool, often like a special diagnostic unit, a laptop for cars, say Toyota might do it or Honda, or somebody like that, that might say make this diagnostic unit for just my vehicle and distribute it through my dealerships. And they'll have programs that they author and the program might last 8 months, 9 months, a year or something like that where they say they are going to roll these out. And then once it's rolled out, it's over. And then you wait -- you have to get another program to continue the business and we have a series of programs. All we were saying was, is that the programs in Europe are running out and the European OEMs, we believe, are a little bit keeping their powder dry, looking at the economics. Even though new car sales are not so down in Europe, I think they're down about 8% -- but still, I think they're being very careful. And so that's what we're seeing in Europe. In the United States, we're seeing less of that, but it's down slightly, down slightly. And I think that's partially because new car sales aren't bad, but the sort of economic uncertainty, the fiscal uncertainty is dominating whether you want to invest in a long-term program like that.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then, I keep reading about the headline risk and the softness reporting in China. Does that have any impact on you?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, it can from time-to-time. I mean, we sell into factories, factories are closing down and we sell some into factories. It can from time to time, but we have some offsets to that -- we sell into Repair and the Repair business moves up. So I think our direct linkage to that is unclear and kind of nebulous.  GDP was down, I think it was 7.8% but if you looked at power consumption in China, the Industrial business, the industrial consumption of power was down but the consumer consumption was up. So that kind of says that well, the industrial sector is weakening, but the consumers are rolling up and in that balance, I'm not sure how that would affect us really. The big thing is China is a great opportunity for us and we keep building physicals there.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "One last question. And I know you provided already some color on this. Just on Europe, what is their -- what are you hearing in some of the attitudes from the people you talk to there?  And, I mean, just kind of looking at certain pockets of areas, I mean, are Scandinavian countries still holding up or I know...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "You know, look -- sorry, go ahead, keep going.", "Alek B. Gasiel - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And I was just going to say I think you commented that Western Europe was down single digits, right?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I would characterize it like this. Of course, the South, Spain and Portugal and those places and Italy and so on, know they are in bigger trouble -- and Greece. They know they've got problems. So when you talk to people, whether your customers -- and our customers are businessmen in most -- by and large, either small or large. And our people, they're very, very, I would say, muted. But they have confidence that they're going to muddle through, they're going to get through this. If you talk to people in what I'll call the other areas of Europe like the U.K. or Scandinavia or France or Germany, they're more positive. They just view this as hey, this is a bump in the road, we're going to batten down the hatches and we're going to go forward. I think our view of -- I think if you read the U.S. papers and you look at Europe, you get more alarmed about the long-term than the impression you get when you walk the grassroots path in Europe. Now I'm not sure who's right, to tell you the truth but you don't get -- I would say, you don't get, I would say, fatalism in Europe. Our people, our customers believe the world's coming back and we believe they're coming back with us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. I hope [indiscernible] On RS&I, Nick, on this OEM dealer business, what's the scale of that these days? How important...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know. But by and large, the OEM facing business, the pure OEM facing business is about 1/3 of the business. There are types of the segment -- sorry, the segment, yes. Sorry I misspoke. It's roughly like this, David, the OEM facing business is 1/3, the independent facing business is 1/3, and equipment, which plays in both territories is another 1/3.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And is that -- given the lumpiness of that business, are those returns such that, that's a space you want to stay in or not?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, the business can be lucrative for us when it's rolling. It is lumpy, but it's not unprofitable now for us. It's just less profitable than the other ones. And one thing that comes through, we like being at least, some of our business, close to the OEMs because we believe it informs us about what's going on for forward thinking around innovation and what's coming in the OEM's product lines. We believe that [indiscernible] something to us.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on the power tools side, how much -- do you have any sense of the tools your franchisees sell off the truck? How many of those tools are your tools versus somebody else's and if there's still an opportunity for you to penetrate that deeper?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't have hard numbers for you but I believe now, a huge share of the tools, the power tools we sell off the truck are Snap-on. I believe, a huge share.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And how important has that been to driving it as opposed to end markets or products or other elements?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It wasn't a factor in this quarter. But over time, I can't tell, but not that significantly. When I'm talking about over time, I'm talking about back when I was in C&I, we used to talk about bringing it home, and that now, we're talking what? 2003, 2002, 2004, we used to be -- I ran the business that had power tools in it. We used to talk about gee, we need to get our franchisees confident in our tools so they won't sell other people's, and we did. And that happened gradually over that time.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last item here as we look at the balance sheet, the manufacturing company here is essentially debt-free. The asset base on the credit company has been rebuilt back to where you wanted it to be. With this cash flow you generate now, what are the priorities for that going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Priorities are first, organic growth and we had some pretty good organic growth in some places, dividends and acquisitions and offsetting dilution. Those are the 4 priorities.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And in the organic growth, I mean, the business is essentially self-funding I mean, you throw off more money than you generate there...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, we're starting to, for sure, yes. I mean, I think you'd be fair to say that we'd start to build up some cash sort of next year, towards the end of next year sometime. And we can put that cash to work.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on the dividend, you're paying about 25% of your earnings. Are you implying that, that number can go -- I mean once upon a time, you're paying out almost half of your earnings.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, but that was because our earnings were lower. I think the denominator was changed. I think, look, we don't have a set number as a percentage. Our unifying principle around dividends is that we have paid the dividend every year, every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it, and that's it. And so every quarter, we assess whether we want to bring our dividend upwards and that's basically what we do.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then lastly on the acquisitions, you haven't really made anything significant since the Business Solutions business. What are your priorities or where your focus areas in terms of acquisitions?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Okay, first, may I simply say though, before I say that is that I kind of view the credit company as a pretty big acquisition. If we had goofed it up, people would've been talking about integration and things like that. So I think it was a kind of acquisition in a way. But look, here's our priorities: we would do -- we will acquire anything along the 4 decisive strategic runways for growth, enhance the network if we acquire anything in that way. Now it's not so clear there would be things there but we would do. And then emerging markets, positions in emerging markets, more strength in the repair shop owners and managers and that customer base or more gravitas in critical industries. Those would be our priorities. And I don't mean in any particular order there. I just think those are -- we'd be looking at all of those areas.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And understanding that timing of those things can be challenging, is that something that's 3 years from now, you hope to be able to execute on some of those or is it -- if something comes along it comes along?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I think we believe there's opportunities. We believe we're coming out from under the credit company, we believe we turn the cash on other things. I mean, I think it's timed by the credit company coming out of getting fulfilled. And so that's when we start looking at that. I think I've been saying this to other people for a while. But I think as I said, sort of next year, we're starting to get in that situation where we're looking very aggressively at these kinds of things. And we -- most us have quite a bit of experience integrating and acquiring companies. So I don't think we have any trepidation about doing any of this stuff.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to your host, Leslie Kratcoski.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks for joining us, everyone. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com.

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs; or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start out by providing my perspective on the results, on our various markets and on the highlights of the quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed review of the financials.", "The results and the trends of our first quarter remained much the same as we've seen in the past few periods. We once again had solid profit gains on a sales increase that came in the face of some continuing headwinds. Our EPS in the quarter of $1.40 was up nearly 16% from last year's $1.21. Our opco operating margin was 14.5%, an increase of 120 basis points. And our operating earnings -- and operating earnings from Financial Services was $30.5 million, up $23.9 million in -- up from the $23.9 million in 2012.", "On a consolidated basis, the overall operating margin was 17.6%. That compares to 15.7% in last year's first quarter. Now we believe that these increased profits clearly demonstrate the benefit being driven by our Snap-on value-creation processes, the set of principles and tools we apply every day to drive improvement, with a focus on safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it. They help us move down our runways for improvement, and they are driving results.", "Related to the sale -- related to sales, we're up in the quarter by 1.5% organically before a negative impact from foreign currency of, I guess, 60 basis points. There are, of course, always differences from period to period. But from my perspective, the big picture is similar to the last quarter. We're seeing reasonable growth in our businesses serving the Automotive Repair sector, in the Tools Group, in the Repair Systems & Information group -- or Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I group. At the same time, there's an offset to the -- to these generally favorable conditions in those businesses due to the dual headwinds that are concentrated in Commercial & Industrial, or the C&I group. Those headwinds, restricted military spending and the overall turbulence in Europe were the principal factors in the C&I sales decline.", "Importantly, our balanced approach to driving advancement in those areas that we've identified as being decisive to our future overcame the headwinds and challenges. Our focus on expanding into critical industries, building in emerging markets, enhancing the franchise channel and expanding in the garage has authored ongoing year-over-year gains for the past few years despite some challenging macros.", "The varied opportunities -- available thoughts along those declined run rates create our ability to offset the continuing headwinds. And in this quarter, we saw particular strength in the critical industries of natural resources and aerospace, continued gains with diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and a strong uptick in activity with automotive OEM dealerships, especially related to essential diagnostics.", "Now let's go on to some discussion of the segments. As I mentioned, the C&I group is where we see the largest impact from the headwinds of military spending in Europe. Similar to last quarter, those main headwinds resulted in an organic sales decrease of 6.3%.", "One of the highlights in the quarter, however, was the 11.5% operating margin for the group. That represents increase of 130 basis points, more than overcoming the impact from the volume shortfall, with operating improvements driven by Snap-on value creation.", "Speaking to that improved profit margin, our European hand tool business, SNA Europe, was a significant contributor. Over the past few years, we've dedicated a fair amount of restructuring to that operation, and those investments, along with some strong RCI activity, are paying off. SNA Europe actually raised its profits year-over-year despite high-single-digit sales -- despite the high-single-digit sales decline that was similar to last quarter. Clearly, the overall environment in Europe remains challenged. So the rise in profitability was a big help and represents great progress.", "Our Industrial business was -- which was once again impacted by the military contractions, saw gains in other critical industries like aviation and natural resources. Based on the domestic growth in oil and gas industry, you might imagine, we have significant potential in serving those customers. And we did see progress in that segment. We've expanded our large tool offering and developed new special tool applications, including tethered tools for use at height. And we recently kicked off a new program to call on key customers out in the oil and gas field, with large specialized trucks loaded with an array of tools specifically for those unique oil and gas applications. We're also working together with fuel service operations to outfit their maintenance trucks with the unique tool kits that match the requirements at these large sites.", "One more point on our efforts in oil and gas, it's a global opportunity. You can see that with some of the significant wins we had in the quarter outside the U.S., in places like Latin America and North Africa. See, overall, we can see our efforts in natural resources coming together, building traction in that important industry.", "We also saw a gain in the critical aviation and aerospace sector. Hereto, we have uniquely designed vans, mobile aviation technology labs calling on customers, touring the country, visiting sites, providing hands-on demonstration of our product line for those special applications, from tool control units and software, to power tools, to hand tools and specialty toolkits. Whether we access those customers with these mobile labs or with stores in MRO facilities, or with product catalogs integrated within the customer's individual purchasing systems, we are serving those customers more frequently and more effectively. And it's all driving the progress and the progress you can see in this critical sector -- in that critical sector.", "Finally, in C&I, I'll speak about Asia/Pacific. It was a mixed period. We were up in China across all our product lines, and in India. Elsewhere, activity was off, and we didn't get the overall increase we've normally seen across the region. But what we know and what we are confident in is that we are building both the physicals and position in the emerging markets of Asia. I've said it many times, the presence in the physicals, that's what's most important in this region. I mentioned last time, we opened a fourth plant at the Kunshan complex. This one's dedicated to under-car equipment. With those new capabilities, we're launching new lifts, both mid-tier scissors models that serve the OEM and higher-end shops across Asian markets, and lower cost two-post products that are important in the emerging markets for the developing independent repair shop segment. I was just in Asia last week and I saw some of the early production at that new factory, and the product looks great.", "Across Asia, we've been establishing our position with a product line at the super-premium level, growing at top-end shops. Now, as we expand with added physicals, we're able to broaden that offering to serve independent garages and larger chains with mid-tier tire changes, wheel balancers and our handheld diagnostics units, which continue, by the way, to add content and vehicle coverage.", "As you know, we have a state-of-the-art engineering center in Kunshan, and that team is growing, becoming better able to help localize under-car and diagnostics products. We have more local talent supporting growth in the region, with a focus on new products developed specifically for those markets.", "Now on to the Tools Group. Sales were up 3.7% with a 14.4% operating margin, about 20 basis points below last year, but a strong absolute level. The growth wasn't as robust as we've seen in recent periods, but it's not a surprise that the pace didn't continue. Importantly, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall market.", "Now there were a number of factors early in the period, including the lingering impact from superstorm Sandy, and perhaps some pause as the tax increases were digested at the beginning of the year. But the year-over-year comparison got better each month of the quarter, so the trends are good. The strength of our van channel is evident in the numbers and in the trends. Our franchisee health metrics continue to be favorable. The progress of our franchisee opportunity recently -- and the progress of our franchise opportunity recently received additional validation when the Franchise Business Review ranking was announced by the International Franchise Association. Snap-on was listed among the top large networks, improving our ranking again this year. The importance of this recognition is that it's based solely on franchisee satisfaction and independent survey in areas like training, support, operations and financial opportunity. We believe it's convincing testimony to the growing strength of the network.", "New and innovative products have been one of the keys to our progress in the Tools Group. In one recent example, we launched the FLL80 ratchet to build upon the success of our innovative extended reach line. This 3/8-inch drive ratchet has a total length of 17.5 inches. It includes the strength of our Dual 80 technology. It connects with our technicians customers for making their work easier as they face ever-growing challenges related to tighter spaces and to shrinking accessibility. That new ratchet is long. It's the longest in the industry, and it delivers superior strength and durability. It delivers the superior strength and durability always expected from Snap-on.", "Our great new products aren't restricted to hand tools. Just this past quarter, we took our award-winning VERUS PRO handheld unit to the U.K. It was a success in the United States, and that momentum has continued internationally where that diagnostic unit has been extremely well received. So franchisee help, survey gains, innovative new product. We believe they're all testimony to the progress that's being made in enhancing the van network, one of our strategic, decisive runways.", "I move now to the RS&I group. Sales in the quarter were up organically 9.3%, and the operating margin of 23% expanded by 150 basis points. Throughout last year, we spoke about the growth of our repair information and diagnostics products with independent repair shop owners and managers. That happened again this quarter.", "But this quarter, the overall growth rate also got a real boost by increased activity in essential diagnostic tools for OEM dealerships. For independent shops, the growth is being led by new handhelds, better and easier to use. And by Repair Information Products, helping technicians fix the car faster. One of these is the new VERUS PRO full-function unit which I just mentioned. It's just received more recognition, the Best New Product Award as voted by the -- by Automotive Service Professionals at the recent Vision Hi-Tech Training and Expo, an event which is attended by nearly 3,500 industry participants.", "We're building our presence in the garage, but not just at the high end or just in automotive diagnostics. This quarter, we launched with great reception our new entry-level handheld diagnostic unit, the Blue-Point MICROSCAN 3. It's an upgrade from the previous versions, and it includes a larger screen and touch capability for added efficiency. With its basic onboard scanning function, it's another great entree product, helping to make new technicians become Snap-on customers for life.", "And outside automotive, in heavy duty, our Pro-Link iQ Diagnostic Unit has been upgraded. Additional repair data parameters and engine test functions with expanded coverage of engines, transmissions and breaks, all while serving an ever-growing number of models and units.", "Outside of the independent automotive space, our Snap-on Business Solutions and equipment solutions businesses, which serve OEM dealerships, are also expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage. Just this quarter, we added a new electronic parts catalog -- we added new electronic parts catalog customers in adjacent sectors, industries like motorcycles and power sports. And this goes along with the increased essential diagnostic programs for automotive OEM dealerships that I already mentioned.", "When we brought together the various businesses that now comprise RS&I several years ago, we believed we could leverage their capabilities to better serve repair shop owners and managers. And progress along that runway is evident in our results.", "Well that's the segments. I'll conclude by sharing one final highlight. Every year in the first quarter, we hold an RCI competition that brings together teams from across the corporation to share best practices and successes in moving down our runway for improvement. In February, we had 34 teams present their story. The day always concludes with dinners -- with a dinner where awards are presented with much excitement. It's quite competitive. And this year, the champion was a team from our Kunshan facility, Kunshan, China. We believe the enthusiasm of that event, and it was evident. And the fact that a team from China was the winner is a great indicator of the depth and the reach of RCI and Snap-on. It's the foundation of our ongoing improvement, and it is strong.", "Well, that's our first quarter. Continuing headwinds offset by gains in important areas, diagnostics and information for repair shop owners and managers, essential tools for vehicle OEMs and dealerships and extensions in aerospace and natural resources. When paired with Snap-on value creation, the sum of it all is that opco OI is up 120 basis points, a significant and encouraging performance.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick.", "Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $741.7 million in the quarter increased 1.5% organically. Higher sales to OEM dealerships, increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products and continued higher sales of the Snap-on Tools Group more than offset lower sales to the military and ongoing weakness in Europe. Consolidated gross profit of $356.9 million increased $9.2 million from 2012 levels, and gross margin of 48.1% improved 80 basis points, largely due to savings from ongoing rapid continuous improvement, or RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $249.1 million decreased $1.1 million, and the operating expense margin of 33.6% improved 40 basis points from 2012 levels.", "Total restructuring cost of $2.9 million in the quarter compared with $4 million last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services of $107.8 million increased 10.6% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 120 basis points from 13.3% last year to 14.5% this year.", "Operating earnings from Financial Services of $30.5 million increased $6.6 million, or 27.6% over prior-year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $138.3 million increased 13.9% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 17.6% improved 190 basis points from 15.7% a year ago.", "Our first quarter effective income tax rate was 31.9%. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%, but this quarter's rate benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research tax credit and certain other business tax provisions included in the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which you'll recall was signed into law on January 2 of this year.", "Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $82.8 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $71 million, or $1.21 per share last year, representing a 15.7% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $266.4 million were down 6.3% organically from 2012 levels. The decrease was primarily due to double-digit decline in sales to the military and a high-single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business as a result of ongoing market weakness in that region.", "Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $99 million in the quarter, and gross margin of 37.2% improved 160 basis points, primarily due to the savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe, partially offset by $2 million of higher restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $68.4 million in the quarter declined $4.4 million from 2012 levels. The operating expense margin of 25.7% increased 30 basis points from 25.4% last year, primarily due to the lower sales. This was partially offset by $3.4 million of lower restructuring costs.", "As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings of $30.6 million for the C&I segment increased $1.4 million from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 11.5% improved 130 basis points from 10.2% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $327.3 million increased 3.7% organically, reflecting increases across both U.S. and international franchise operations.", "Gross profit of $143.9 million increased $4.9 million from 2012 levels, and the gross margin of 44% compared with 43.9% last year. Operating expenses totaled $96.7 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 29.6% increased 30 basis points from 29.3% last year.", "Operating earnings of $47.2 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $1.1 million, and the operating margin of 14.4% compared with 14.6% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $246.1 million increased 9.3% organically, primarily due to a double-digit gain in the sales to OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digits gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products.", "Gross profit totaled $114 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 46.3% decreased 90 basis points from 47.2% last year, primarily due to a shift in the sales mix that included higher volumes of lower gross margin essential tool and facilitation products to OEM dealerships, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses totaled $57.5 million, and the operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 240 basis points from 2012 levels. Again, primarily due to contribution from sales volume leverage, including benefits from the shift in sales mix, as well as savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.", "First quarter operating earnings of $56.5 million for the RS&I Group increased 16.3%, and the operating margin of 23% improved 150 basis points from 21.5% last year.", "Now turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings from Financial Services increased $6.6 million, or 27.6%. Originations of $171.9 million in the quarter rose 10% year-over-year.", "Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes $1.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $932 million from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries.", "In the U.S., $745 million, or 80% of the financing portfolio, relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Excluding $5.7 million of unfavorable currency impacts, our worldwide on-book financing portfolio grew approximately $23 million in the quarter. For the 2013 full year, we continue to anticipate that the gross on-book finance portfolio will increase by approximately $80 million to $90 million over 2012 year-end levels.", "As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $75.7 million in the quarter increased $10.7 million from $65 million last year, reflecting higher levels of net earnings as well as net changes in operating assets and liabilities. This quarter, we made cash contributions of $5.3 million to our U.S. pension plans, including $5 million of discretionary contributions.", "Capital expenditures of $14.7 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $21.8 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.", "Turning to Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared to 61 days as of 2012 year-end. Inventories increased $3.1 million organically from 2012 year-end levels. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.9x were unchanged from 2012 year-end levels.", "Our quarter-end cash position of $213.6 million, reflects the funding of $144.4 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $22.1 million, share repurchases of $21.7 million in the quarter and capital expenditures of $14.7 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income and $122.5 million of cash from collections of finance receivables. Our net-debt-to-cap ratio of 29.5% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year-end.", "In addition to our $214 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit rating allows us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so.

Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo.", "Let me just summarize my perspectives on the quarter. We had the headwinds in Europe and the military. We had gains in vehicle repair and critical industries, which more than offset the continuing challenges. But what I view as most significant is that we believe we've strengthened our position along our decisive runways, enhancing the van channel. The network is stronger, and you clearly get that impression when you meet with the franchisees. And franchisee turnover was down again.", "Expanding with vehicle repair shop owners and managers, our diagnostics and information products have never been more powerful or better received. Extending to critical industries, you can see our connections with aerospace and natural resources customers growing.", "And building in emerging markets, our fourth factory in Kunshan is coming to light, and our Asian engineering center is growing in effectiveness. Our strength increased in each of these decisive areas, and we believe it's that progress which is most important and ensures our continued advancement.", "This quarter also clearly demonstrated gains along our runway for improvement, progress propelled by the Snap-on value-creation processes. They have become part of our corporate everyday culture, and you can see it in the numbers, Opco operating margin of 14.5%, up 120 basis points; and EPS of $1.40, rising despite the challenges. We believe that the energy of Snap-on value creation and the strengthening of our positions in the 4 areas of strategic importance will enable our team to continue on its encouraging trend, as we move through 2013 and beyond.", "Now finally, before I conclude, it's appropriate that I recognize Snap-on franchisees and associates. As usual, I know many of you are listening. Your enthusiasm, your capability and your dedication made our first quarter possible. For your extraordinary contribution to our performance, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing commitment to your team, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Mary for questions. Mary?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "How much forward visibility do you have on this military order book? And you'd indicated it was down double-digits. So I'm just wondering if that's kind of the pace that's expected over the balance of the year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. But what happens is, is that the base shrinks. I think I said in the fourth quarter -- we don't have the greatest visibility. We know that the military isn't the most robust of businesses. Whether we have visibility or not, it's kind of -- you read any paper or anything like that, you see both sequestration causing uncertainty around the Department of Defense, and you see the fact that troops are coming home. The difference there is, David, is that -- and I think I did say this in the fourth -- in the last conference call, the fourth quarter is our biggest quarter, the first quarter is our next highest, and then it reduces as we go to the second and third quarter. And then the second and third quarter last year, as the world progressed, we were already seeing some sort of contraction. So contractions are liable to be big. In fact, they were a little bit bigger in the first quarter than it was on a percentage basis than the fourth quarter, but the base is smaller. So we would expect the impact to somewhat reduce -- attenuate I would say.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So is the -- so you're still expecting to be down maybe double-digits, but it becomes a less consequential part of the business, is what you're saying?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Correct. And I've sized this for people. People have asked how big it is, and the -- well, we don't give guidance by segments. Or what we've said is, is that the -- it's part of the industrial business, the critical industries, which is roughly, give or take, $400 million, a little bit over $400 million business. And we've identified 5, 6 segments in that business, the critical segments in that business, and this is one of the bigger ones. So you can kind of chop them up into 5 or 6 pieces and say okay, this is one of the bigger ones, and calendarize it like I said, fourth biggest; first, next biggest; and then second and third. That kind of gives you some directional guidance, and that's what I see coming on. We don't have the greatest visibility. And any -- much of our business is in terms of backlog. So...", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "On the RS&I business, I guess it sounds like the facilitation business has come back a little bit, and that was the source of the pressure on the gross margin in that segment? Is the facilitation business back in somewhat of a permanent way now? Or how should we think about the mixed dynamics in that segment going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. Let me give you a couple of thoughts. One is, strictly -- you have it right. But strictly speaking, the facilitation business in that business is sort of like a distribution business. We're speaking -- that's where we offer distribution services for OEM dealerships. You're appointed by Toyota or somebody else to kind of be their go-to supplier for a wide variety of products for the dealerships, for their dealership network. That's not what we're referring to here. We're referring to the other side of that, what we call EQS business, which is essential diagnostics, where an OEM manufacturer says I'd like to roll out either a hard tool -- I said diagnostics, but any essential tool, either a hard tool or a diagnostics, a laptop for a specific make of car -- and says, Snap-on, I'd like you to develop -- help us develop it and roll it out to our distribution -- well, help roll it out to our dealerships. And what happened here is we got a couple of those products -- we got a couple of those programs in place now that are rolling, and that nurtures this business. It does tend to be lumpy. So you can -- you get an award, it says -- some manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, says I'd like to rollout -- Rolls-Royce doesn\u2019t have many dealerships, but let's say Toyota or somebody, says I'd like you to roll out to my dealerships, and you do it and it takes you 5 quarters. And then there's no -- there isn't a program, so you have to replace it with another program. So it can be lumpy. Overlaid on top of that, though, David, is whether the OEMs themselves are feeling robust or more favorable. And I think -- actually, I think the 2013 forecast in North America are for what? Must be a 5% increase in the auto industry? So a 15.1% to 15.7% or something like that? So I mean, it\u2019s a small increase. So I think they're a little bit more positive here. So we're seeing little positive news there. Plus, on top -- overlaid on top of this lumpy business. Did that help you a little bit?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. The last question -- yes, that does help. Last question, I guess, just pertains to possible acquisitions. And I guess the question is\u2026", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "What acquisition? Say that again, please.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. The last question just has to do with acquisitions, and I guess the question is just how much leverage would you be willing to undertake in support of an acquisition?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Oh, I don't know if I'm -- I don\u2019t know if I want to necessarily speak about that on a call or in this kind of situation. I'd just offer that -- if you look at our\u2026", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Because I'm just wondering if there was softening [ph].", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Credit [indiscernible] and you look at our operating business, we had quite a bit of powder available. So I think that's sufficient to say that. I think those questions, David, always depend on the particular opportunity that's there. It's kind of a happenstance. One of the things -- we have capability in-house who knows how to acquire, because we have people who have experience in this. We have -- I know we have a great integration team available. We are reviewing an ongoing list of possibilities, and we know we have ammo. So I think we would adjust to any kind of situation. So I wouldn't want to pen myself in, in that regard.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Couple of things. Let's start with the Tool business. And Nick, you had -- and Aldo, you had talked about carryover impact from Sandy and payroll tax increase having an impact. Can you characterize on an exit rate what type of growth you might have been seeing? And I don't want to get bogged down in monthly numbers at all, but were you 0 to 3 to 6? Or some characterization there of how you ended...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't want to speak like that, but I would -- it's hard for me to characterize, but let me try it this way. You and I have talked, spoken many times about this, and I think I've said on every conference call that we have had over the last -- I don't know, more than 2 years, when the Tools Group is rolling double-digits, I have cautioned everyone that I don't think that continues. I think we hold to our 4% to 6%, but then there's the question of how fast is the deceleration. Right? I think. And I think everybody recognized that it probably can't grow at double-digits forever, and so how does that transition occur? And that was the $64,000 question. And I think, given -- I would just talk -- and this is speculation and so on, but I would say if we didn't see the lingering effects of Sandy, which we know is a factor, because we know Middle Atlantic was down and there were other places in the regions that were down, but if we didn't see that and if we didn't see what I would consider -- I can't document this, but what seemed to be a pause associated with -- it might have been the payroll tax, it might have been other things around -- it was kind of like a boundary layer when we went over '12 to '13. I think, we would have seen a more cushioned deceleration, let's say. If that helps.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So do you think we're\u2026", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "More expectable, would have been more expectable. I think people had certain expectations around those things, and I think this would have been a decelerated quarter. But it would have been more cushions, less abrupt.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And what kind of numbers did you see in the U.S. versus the international markets for the business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, the U.S. -- international was below the -- I mean, international was above the U.S., because the U.S. is where we saw the impact of Sandy and the -- but the international business was also decelerated somewhat as well. So I mean, they were -- but generally, the U.S. was down more than -- decelerated faster than international.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So from your perspective then, it sounds like we've, more quickly than expected guidance to sport a 5% or 4% to 6% kind of range going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I don't want to say that I expected that. I mean, I don't -- I never knew how we would go into that. I'd simply say that I think we have an event. We had some boundary layer conditions at the end of last year and certainly the beginning of -- mostly the beginning of this year that tended to what I want to say steepen or heighten the deceleration. And I still think 3.7% isn\u2019t chopped liver, I would offer. And so we are not -- if I look at the 4% to 6% myself, I would say look, we always said we'd grow at 4% to 6% over time. We said 3.7% is reasonably inside -- a standard deviation of that, so it\u2019s the kind of variation you'd see around those numbers. So I'm not so surprised about the 3.7%. I'm simply offering that in this particular period, if we didn't have the boundary layer, we probably would have seen somewhat softened -- a softer change.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the RS&I side, when you look at the minority interest there at Mitchell 1, I'm suspecting that Mitchell 1 was a very strong performer there for you?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, it was. It was. Great performance, yes.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Is that something that's tied to these roll out on the essential diagnostics? Or is that something more structural that can grow faster?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. Mitchell one -- let me just parse between these 2 things. I mean, make my comment about Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 has been actually part of our -- been a good success story for some time, and it expanded that success in the first quarter. And that is not related to the essential diagnostics. Essential diagnostics is with OEM dealerships. This is fundamentally with independent dealerships, and they just seem to be growing their position with independent dealerships. They're getting better at what they do, and the dealerships are recognizing it and they're embracing it more. Now when you talk about the minority interest there's a special wrinkle -- that I might want Aldo to comment...", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Yes, David. Aldo. Just -- you're correct that Mitchell 1 was a larger contributor, and 15% of Mitchell 1 is owned by outside parties. So there's a little bit more of an elimination in equity earnings for that. You'll also recall that in Q4, Snap-on divested a non-strategic entity. It was a legacy investment that was part of the ProQuest acquisition. So the earnings from that are no longer in equity earnings. So that also accounts for that lower amount that you see.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on Mitchell 1, just one more item there, has this been driven by a change in the product, upgrading in the product offering, or more effective marketing? Or just normal market recognition over time?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, I'd say both. I think we did change the product. I want to say 6, 7 months ago, we changed to ProDemand. We changed to ProDemand, which was an upgrade, kind of a new model, if you will, of repair information. A lot better navigation, same great database that's wider than anybody else and terrific, but also better navigation. People really have appreciated that. And so that's one. Two, is our marketing has been better. We've driven customer connection into Mitchell 1 pretty effectively. So they're out constantly. They've got a pretty robust process, looking at the field and getting feedback saying, how can we improve? So they've kind of got this ongoing improvement activity that's actually, I think, pretty good for a software business, that's overlaying on top of the sort of upgrades and the software. They're actually improving it based on what the customers are telling them, and we never had that before. So we're doing better at that. And then thirdly, we're expanding a little bit our reach into heavy duty and other places. So we've got a couple of other non-automotive segments in there. So all 3 of those things are in a cocktail, and it's been doing pretty well. And when it came together this quarter with the sort of diagnostic information products, the repair shop owners and managers that went up and we paired it with a pretty robust quarter for -- we've been kind of carrying the OEM dealerships for several quarters. You might remember, last year's numbers were like 0.5, 2.9, 2.7 in RS&I. Now we're up pretty well because we've got -- we're hitting on more like oil cylinders. We're still carrying 25% of European business with that business. And one of the things that happened was that SBS, the parts catalog business, got out from under the consolidation of the dealerships. That was an ongoing tail. We were even receiving some of the impact last year. That stopped now. So that's back to some upward movement.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Nick, can you -- when did you start seeing this military business slide? I'm trying to get at -- where are we at? Are we at the anniversary...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, we started to see it, I think -- I wanted to see -- we started to see it sort of in the middle of the second quarter, third quarter last year, like mostly the third quarter, we started to see it roll. Third quarter was weak, but it was a smaller base. It makes -- I don't think it made scrutiny in the third quarter even though it wasn't good for us.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So really, the fourth quarter year-over-year, we should see -- that's where it kind of anniversaries then, right?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Third quarter, I'd say, too. I'd say. But the fourth quarter, clearly the big anniversary. So -- yes, that's right. That's right.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Have you been seeing the declines increase quarter-over-quarter or\u2026", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, it increased some, but not -- I would -- arithmetically, it's a greater increase in the second quarter as a percent of a smaller base than the fourth quarter, but I would tend to say that's within the range of government work. You know what I mean? In the range of a variation that you might see on this kind of thing. So I guess it's pretty much the same decline.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question is, is the portfolio built to the point now where it's going to really mimic the growth in the Tools Group?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Yes. This is Aldo, Gary. I think you have that correct. There's still a small piece of tailwind that we'll pick up from CIT, but as you can see on the chart, the extended credit portfolio owned by CIT and managed by us is down to less than $10 million. So going forward, it'll mirror the growth in Snap-on Tools. But just recollect that it -- Tools, the portfolio underwrites more big ticket items. So within the Tools Group you can sometimes get a little bit of variation in the amount of big-ticket items that they sell as opposed to the lower-priced items which tend to be underwritten by the franchisees themselves. So you get a little bit of noise quarter-to-quarter. But long run, it should move in concert.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the margins in the C&I Group for the quarter. Looking back over the past year, we've been in that mid-11% range since the quarter of last year, but the first quarter of last year it was a lot lower. Was there anything special in that first quarter a year ago that had the margins down?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I don't think so. I think generally, we tend to get seasonality around first -- at different quarters. We don\u2019t have great seasonality in sales. But sometimes, you'll get OI seasonality because of -- as you open up a year, you'd be spending on kick-off type things. So you get out, you have distributors, you have people you meet, you have new programs, and you tend to roll them out at the first of the year. So often time, that's an overhang on these -- of those types of quarters. I'm not saying it happens every year, but it happened in many years at C&I, because I used to run C&I. So we think what happened in the C&I is this. You've got what? Is it 130 basis points up? And I'd say, what, 40 basis points is due to lower restructuring. And then I think you can put down the rest to RCI. And the reason there is, is because when you've got a division that's having difficulty on sales, like SNA Europe or -- you tend to be -- put your nose to the grindstone at this stuff, even though it's a way of life. Every place in the corporation, they tend to push hard. You tend to spend restructuring money, and we're seeing that come to fruition. And so we really think that the quarter we see in C&I is -- really reflects to a large degree, the improvement in productivity that we're seeing around, because there is spending associated with this ongoing, associated with the first quarter. So I don't think there was anything special last time.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "The volume operating leverage, obviously with revenues being down 7%, one might not expect you to attain the same kind of operating leverage that we saw in the last 3 quarters of last year. But yet you were still able to do that. How much -- if you didn't have that year-over-year difference in your operating leverage, what kind of margin improvement could we have expected?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'm not sure. Let me just say -- let me just try to answer your question this way. Look, this is a relatively complex landscape as you know. As I know you know our company, and it is complex. So it's hard to say with definitive -- make a definitive statement on any particular quarter, no matter what you see. But the thing is, is that you -- we have said that if the sales were flat, just flat, we could keep raising operating margins through the effect of our Snap-on value creation. We're confident of that. And this quarter, what we saw on the 120 basis points of improvement was 10 points of restructuring, favorability; 20 points of mix, because RS&I was up and C&I was down, so there were more different profitabilities; and then the rest you can roll up to RCI, which is associated with that. So you can expect us to try to -- not in any one particular quarter, you might not be able to see it. But over time, you'll see an overlay, and you can look back and see it. You can look back and see it. So we have operating improvement every quarter. I think -- I hope that answers your question.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "To some degree. I mean, I was looking for -- well, operating leverage was this kind of a negative impact. But because of RCI, we had this much positive impact. But that's okay. I'm [indiscernible].", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "[indiscernible] how much. I hate to pin myself down on operating leverage. I mean, associated with volume? Yes, I don't like to say it -- I don't like to give you any particular number about that, but you can be sure that if we get -- as we get higher volume, we do get some operating leverage.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay. With respect to Europe, at some point, with new car sales being down as much as they are and looking like we're going to have a 6th straight year of significant decline over there, at some point, the aftermarket has to pick back up because people are just going to have to be fixing their cars if they're going to keep them longer. Have you seen any of that yet? Or when are you expecting something like that to start occurring over there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'm out of the business of predicting where Europe is going. I think I predicted that it was at the bottom like 2 years ago or something. So I don\u2019t know. But look, I think this, is that Europe was down again for us. Our hand tool business in Europe was down, what, high single-digits, and it was down sort of low double-digits the last time. And we're not all in auto. We're in other businesses. So it's a broad base. Industry, construction, agriculture, a lot of other things. So it's a cocktail of things. I don't know in general when Europe will come back, but I'm confident -- we're pretty confident it will, and we're -- actually, we're pretty positive about this. We think this is one of the hidden gems about Snap-on because what you've got here is you've got a business which is improving its operational fitness. Profit is up when sales are down almost double digits, and yet we know that our customers are out there. We know that our customers still are remaining. So when the Europe comes back, we figure we're going to do pretty well on that. Okay?", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Yes, very good. On Financial Services, you're getting to the point where you're pretty much up to speed with respect to mimicking the tools as you mentioned earlier in the call. I was curious, is there any other opportunities with your Financial Services that you might be interested in pursuing in terms of providing credit services in other areas?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. we have said -- I think we have said that our Financial Services is hand-in-glove with our Tools Group -- with our own operations. So we view it as limited to the strategic support of Snap-on operations. We don't view it as a sort of a credit company that provides services to other things, which aren't associated with the rest for the business. We see it as financing our customers and our products and our franchisees, that's it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Nick, just one last item here. You talked about China and how you're expanding your product range there. What portion of your product offering do you think you have available in China, Southeast Asia to deliver into the market today?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I would say we have 1/3 right now. Maybe 40%, that kind of thing. Maybe 1/3. You mean in terms of our overall product line? You mean in terms of the overall Snap-on product line? Is that what...", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I'd say about 1/3. We have entries in virtually every category, maybe less than 1/3. Maybe 1/4 actually. So let's say 1/4 to 1/3, we are -- but we have pretty comprehensive activity. We're putting our toe in a lot of places. But our product line is quite narrow in each -- is more narrow than we have in other places, simply because you've got to start from 0, and you're trying to build up. And so that's an important thing. And a lot of this is learning the specific characterizations -- character of the customers. Not China, but just -- as we roll out into new markets like China or aerospace, you have to learn. I was just in an aerospace facility down in Indianapolis recently, and it's interesting to walk the floor of that place, 800 technicians, and you realize how different it is than vehicle -- this was our money. It was vehicle -- different from vehicle repairs. Some of the tools are held centrally. Some of them are done -- owned by each technician. The technicians don't necessarily do the same thing, so they need a different set of tools. But one thing is in common, is that they all like Snap-on. I ran into a number of technicians that said -- we had just entered this place. We started to sell there only like 3 or 4 months ago. It's part of the reason why our aerospace is up. And they said \"We're glad you're here.\" The same kind of thing happens in China. You're constantly understanding where the customer base is, what they want and adjusting the product line and then trying to Asian-ize the product line to this. So it's an ongoing process. And I would say, we've got about 25% now.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And do you think it's -- how much of your product offering do you think you could put there? Could it be 100%? Or is it only half of it?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "A version of a lot of it. I can't say. But nothing -- unfortunately, probably nothing goes exactly. We have to make changes to almost everything, and that's what we call Asianization. That's why the product line -- I think one of the mistakes people make is they try to sell what they have. And it doesn't really work. It works at the top end. That's how you enter. We entered with the top end with the super-premium brand, we're selling to the best people, and then what happens -- when you have to deal with the other people, you actually have to make products that they might want and that they -- that fit their actual situations. For example, garages in China are lot -- a lot of the garages in China are a lot smaller. So things like your under-car equipment have to be configured for that. Now it's got the same base, the same actual function, but the physicals, the geometries of it have to change. Now that might not be a tough engineering move, but it has to happen. First, you have to realize it's needed; and secondly, then you have to execute it. So we're constantly doing that. That's why I'm so excited about the engineering center.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then the last item, just following on, on that, what about your geographic footprint in Asia, Southeast Asia? Is that -- how much more work is there to build that out like you wanted to be?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's a lot more work in China and India. We've got a lot more work there. I think -- we could tick off the countries, I think we have more work in Indonesia. We have more work in the Philippines. We're pretty good in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Melanie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call. Any statements made during the call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs; or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start off today with the highlights of our second quarter. I'll cover the general environment, then I'll discuss some of the progress down our runways for both growth and improvement. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.", "Much as we've seen over the past several quarters, we were again able to overcome the substantial headwinds to post solid sales and profit gains. Our organic sales increased 3.1% from last year's level, with opco operating income rising to $117.8 million or 15.4% of sales, and Financial Services contributed an additional $30.6 million, up $5 million from last year. It all added up to a consolidated operating margin equal to 18.4% of revenues and EPS -- and an EPS of $1.50, which is up more than 15% from last year's $1.30.", "Now there are a couple of items in this year's year-over-year comparison that should be noted. First, last year's results were impacted by a relatively high restructuring charge, which included $6.8 million for pension settlement at our now closed Canadian tool storage facility. Also this year, we incurred $4.4 million in higher stock-based and mark-to-market cost that was primarily related to our recent share price increase and to more participation in our long-standing employee and franchisee stock purchase program. But even after adjusting for these 2 items, we believe that the year-over-year comparisons represent encouraging progress. Related to our quarterly sales of $764.1 million, in addition to the 3.1% organic increase, we also had $8.5 million or 120 basis-point contribution from our recent acquisition of Challenger Lifts. Along with a negative 70 basis-point impact from foreign currency, the total result was an overall sales increase of 3.6%.", "Now at a macro level, we haven't seen much change in the external environment from the last 2 quarters. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I group, both which primarily serve the automotive repair sector, are showing mid to high single-digit volume gains. However, those increases and the generally favorable market environments in those automotive-related segments are somewhat offset by Commercial & Industrial, or the C&I group. You may remember that the businesses in C&I are where we feel the brunt of our major headwinds and the overall unevenness in the world economies. You see it continuing this quarter mainly with softness in Europe and the impact on SNA Europe; our hand tool business is based in that region, and in reduced military spending driven by troop withdrawals and budgetary constraints. So there are challenges, but as I see it, there's also further progress. We do believe that this quarter's results clearly demonstrate the benefits of and the balance inherent in the strategies we're pursuing as we proceed down our runways for both growth and improvement.", "For growth, we've identified 4 areas that are critical to our future: enhancing the franchise channel; expanding in the garage; building in emerging markets; and expanding into critical industries. And again this quarter, strategic progress in those areas more than offset the impact of the external headwinds.", "Let me focus for a moment on customer connection and innovation. These are 2 key components of Snap-on value creation and they're helping drive our growth. Just this past quarter, Snap-on was again recognized for innovation when Professional Tools and Equipment News, or PTEN, recognized us with their top Innovation Awards in 5 categories. I've mentioned some of these products in the past, and I'll highlight a few more now on the heels of their wins. In the tool storage category, Snap-on was recognized for our diagnostic mobile workstation. It's a complete diagnostic and information system packaged in a secure, fully enclosed unit that's on wheels, so it can easily be moved around the garage, going right to where the work needs to be done. The station was designed for use with our VERDICT handheld unit. It provides custom foam cutouts for organization of accessories, a mounting place for a monitor and plenty of storage space for other tools.", "Another of these award-winning products was the AC Touchless Wheel Clamp. This unique design allows alignment techs to securely clamp the tire in one single and fast motion without touching the rim. Now today, that's important because cars -- today's cars have ever more varied and sensitive and expensive rims. People worry about rim damage, this fixes it.", "And lastly, of these recent winners -- and lastly, of the recent winners, I'll mention the BK8000 wireless digital inspection scope. This tool provides the technician with the ability to visually inspect areas that are normally inaccessible but are important to see, like under the dash, behind the engine block, inside the transmission housing or engine. And has a screen that's 40% larger than the competition, touch interface, rechargeable aluminum -- lithium batteries, and more memory than ever before for digital video. This scope is a worthy winner of this award and is a popular seller.", "One important additional fact that I think everybody should know or recognize is that the PTEN award -- about the PTEN award, is that they're voted on by actual users. So the Snap-on products selected as innovation leaders were chosen by a panel that included active technicians and shop owners, those who will actually use the product. We believe that customer connection is a big advantage for Snap-on. With our 4,800 franchisees around the world, hundreds of direct salespeople, calling on 600,000 repair shops and many more critical work sites, we have great insight in the products that will make work easier for professionals. The PTEN awards, selected by the same professionals, are evidence that customer connection innovation are advantages for Snap-on and you can see it in the results.", "Now demonstrating our balance between growth and improvement, we also saw stronger operating performance in the quarter. In fact, the opco operating margin of 15.4% recorded in the period does represent a new level. You see everyday, we're applying the elements of Snap-on value creation: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI. It's a focus that moves up along the runways for improvement and the gains can be seen not just in those areas benefiting from our increased volume, but other places. In fact, maybe more telling, even though C&I group was down in sales this quarter, it still achieved a 12.6% operating margin. The impact of the sales decline was checked and limited. That's Snap-on value creation.", "Speaking of C&I -- I'll move to a discussion of each of our segments. C&I sales of $266.2 million were down 5.4% organically, with an additional 70 basis-point drop from currency. Operating income was of $33.6 million, actually was up, as I said, a reasonable job eliminating the impact from the drop in volume.", "For the group, there really wasn't much change from last quarter's sales picture. Year-over-year activity comparisons were about what we've seen in the past. SNA Europe was down, high-single digits overall, but their profits were up, the benefits of RCI and the restructuring actions we've taken in prior periods. And as expected, military was down again, big double digits. So the headwinds and trends remained about the same, with the normal period-to-period variation seen across individual markets. In short, our overall view and outlook remains the same. The military decline did more than offset gains in -- elsewhere in industrial business. Remember, this is the business that's primarily focused on extending the Snap-on reach in the critical industries, places like aviation, mining and oil and gas. In the past, I've spoken of expanded product line to serve customers in those critical industries, and we continue to have successes with new customers and products.", "One highlight this quarter was strong gains with international aerospace customers. We're reaching more maintenance, repair and overall facilities around the globe. And that extension is aided by new products like our control tech, electronic torque wrench, patented technology to achieve the fastest and most accurate torque and angle combo in a single motion; added durability, important for the critical industry environment; an audible indicator; a vibrating handle; an LED display, all to alert the technician as the proper torque is achieved and bring him right in on target. And it incorporates Snap-on's dual 80 technology, providing more precise yet stronger ratcheting. It just launched, just launched this past quarter, and it's being well received by professionals across the critical industries.", "One more point, one last point, remember that C&I is where we have our primary effort to penetrate emerging economies. These geographies were much as we saw in the first quarter, with India, the Philippines, Turkey and Russia, being particularly positive this quarter. So we'd continue to build position and make progress along that decisive runway.", "Let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 7%, an encouraging volume gain. The operating margin of 15.7% in the quarter represents a new high for the group and compares to 13.7% recorded last year. Now you remember, that there were higher restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2012, $6.9 million of which was in the Tools Group mainly for the Canadian pension settlement. I also mentioned the franchisee stock purchase plan. This quarter, we had $1.8 million higher cost associated with that plan in the Tools Group. These 2 items impact the year-over-year comparisons. But adjusting each, but adjusting each year for the 2 items, this year's operating margin of 16.3% would compare to last year's at 15.8%, still strong growth.", "Big-ticket sales were -- for the Tools Group, big-ticket sales were significant growth drivers in this period. Diagnostics and tool storage units, those products were strong. We believe, it's important for us, because we believe that big-ticket activity provides meaningful evidence of the financial well-being of our customers, and it's a good barometer on the overall health of the auto repair sector. And those sales, those big-ticket sales are being supported by Snap-on Credit. It's an important advantage for us.", "Not only is Credit helping to drive big-ticket activity in North America, but we're now extending some of that advantage in the international van operation. The well-established programs and expertise we've developed here are being applied to our advantage in places like the U.K. and Australia, improving service, increasing customer satisfaction and driving more growth.", "Tools Group performance was also driven by customer connection and innovation. 3 of the 5 PTEN Innovation Award winners are sold by our franchisees. And our many more new products like the innovative S6810 impact flip socket, an 8-millimeter and 10-millimeter hex on the same tool, saving technicians' valuable time and moving today's underbody panels that have dozens of different, different-in-size fasteners, a process required even for routine repair and maintenance. This tool is a big saver.", "Or products like our new digital display circuit testers that provide the technicians with a no-guess voltage rather than having to estimate it based on bulb brightness, we took technology and features from a more advanced multimeter and applied it to a common handheld tester. Now it sounds simple but since April, we've sold tens of thousands of them, well over $1 million in value.", "The group's performance testifies that we are progressing along the strategic runway of enhancing the van channel. You can see it in the franchisee health metrics, sales up, franchisee turnover down, trends positive. So based on the second quarter, the Tools Group appears to be hitting on a lot of cylinders.", "Now for RS&I. A total sales of 8.7 -- a total sales increase of 8.7%, which is made up of an organic rise of 4.9% and additional -- and an additional contribution of 380 basis points from the acquisition of Challenger Lifts, and a 40 basis-point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. The operating margin was a strong 23%. We continue to see strength in our business providing independent shops with diagnostics and repair information, and in serving OEM dealerships with essential hard and diagnostics tools and with electronic parts catalogs. Gains in those businesses drove RS&I growth in spite of flat sales for undercar equipment, a product line that has been impacted by the decline in Europe where we have a relatively large position. Obviously, one of the big highlights for RS&I this quarter was the Challenger Lift acquisition in mid-May. We're excited to add Challenger to our portfolio, a well-established brand, a complementary product line. We believe that the acquisition is a step along our path of coherent growth. It will broaden our product line and help us to better serve customers who are repair shop owners and managers.", "Moving away from undercar equipment. Snap-on's presence is expanding in other parts of the garage and here too the gains are driven by an ever-growing offering of innovative and new products, like entry-level diagnostics. Earlier this year, we launched the successful MICROSCAN 3 and ETHOS Plus in North America, basic diagnostics. Now in the second quarter, we rolled them out internationally in the U.K. They're quite -- and they're quite popular, and these are important entr\u00e9e products introducing technicians to Snap-on capability, creating customers for life who transition into utilizing our full diagnostics line up. Mitchell 1, our repair information business, has also been launching new products to serve the important medium- and heavy-duty truck market. Our new truck labor estimating product, we believe the most complete such database available for estimating truck repair, has been well received and adds to our already strong and growing line up in that segment.", "It's clear to us that we're gaining traction with truck repair shop owners and managers. You can see it with this new estimating product and it's evidenced with our truck repair information offering, which registered a 25% increase in customers since this time last year.", "So that's the highlight to our quarter: advancements along our runways for growth and for improvement; continued expansion with strength in the Tools Group and RS&I, overcoming the external challenges in C&I and its headwinds; and better performance, Snap-on value creation driving improvements, higher profitability across the corporation despite the challenges.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo before making a few closing comments. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $764.1 million in the quarter increased 3.6% from 2012 levels, on an organic basis, sales increased 3.1% excluding the $8.5 million of sales from Challenger Lifts and an unfavorable $4.7 million impact from foreign currency translation. The year-over-year organic sales increase primarily reflects continued higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group, along with higher sales to OEM dealerships, and increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products. These sales increases more than offset lower sales to the military and lower sales in our European-based hand tools business.", "Consolidated gross profit of $373.2 million increased $23.3 million from 2012 levels. Gross margin of 48.8% improved 140 basis points, largely due to lower restructuring costs, as well as savings from ongoing Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $255.4 million increased $10.1 million, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses and $4.4 million of increased stock-based and mark-to-market expenses. The operating expense margin of 33.4% compared with 33.2% last year.", "Restructuring costs in the quarter totaled $1.8 million. Last year, restructuring costs totaled $10.2 million and included $6.8 million for the settlement of a pension plan following the 2011 closure of our Newmarket, Canada facility. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $117.8 million increased 12.6%, and as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points from prior year levels. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $30.6 million increased $5 million or 19.5% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $148.4 million increased 14% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 18.4% improved 170 basis points from 16.7% a year ago.", "Our second quarter effective income tax rate was 32.5%. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $88.4 million or $1.50 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $76.4 million or $1.30 per share last year, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, on Slide 7. Sales of $266.2 million were down 5.4% organically from 2012 levels, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to the military and a high single-digit sales decline in our European-based hand tools business, as a result of ongoing economic weakness in that region. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $105.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 39.6% improved 280 basis points from 36.8% last year, primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe, and lower restructuring costs.", "Operating expenses of $71.8 million in the quarter were essentially flat with prior year levels. The operating expense margin of 27%, however, increased from 25.2% last year, primarily due to lower sales. As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings of $33.6 million for the C&I segment increased $800,000 from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 12.6% improved 100 basis points from 11.6% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales from the Snap-on Tools Group of $346.2 million increased 7% organically, reflecting increases across both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $152.9 million increased $15.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to $6.8 million of lower restructuring costs. The gross margin of 44.2% in the quarter increased 200 basis points from 42.2% last year. Operating expenses of $98.4 million in the quarter increased $5.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related costs and $1.8 million of increased stock-based and mark-to-market expenses associated with our franchisee stock purchase plan. The operating expense margin was 28.5% in both the second quarters, 2013 and 2012. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $54.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $10 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 15.7% increased 200 basis points from 13.7% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $246.2 million increased 8.3% from 2012 levels, including $8.5 million of sales from the recent acquisition of Challenger. Excluding the Challenger sales and unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in the quarter increased $11.1 million or 4.9%, primarily due to a high single-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products. Gross profit totaled $114.9 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 46.7% decreased 110 basis points from 47.8% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales mix that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including the higher sales of essential tool and facilitation products to OEM dealerships and sales from the Challenger acquisition. These gross margin decreases were partially offset by continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses totaled $58.2 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 110 basis points from 2012 levels, primarily due to contributions from sales volume leverage including the effects from the sales mix shift discussed above and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.", "Second quarter operating earnings of $56.7 million for the RS&I group increased $4.5 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin was 23% in both the second quarters of 2013 and 2012.", "Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, earnings from Financial Services increased $5 million or 19.5%, and originations of $203.1 million rose 15.7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter increased $4.6 million, primarily due to continued growth of the on-book finance portfolio and higher average yields. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.4% in the quarter increased 30 basis points from 17.1% last year, and average yield on contract receivables of 9.6% in the quarter increased 20 basis points from 2012 levels.", "Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.15 billion of gross financing receivables, including $976 million from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $169 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $785 million or 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Year-to-date, our worldwide on-book financing portfolio grew approximately $61 million. For the 2013 full year, we anticipate that the gross on-book finance portfolio will increase by approximately $100 million over 2012 year-end levels. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. I'll also note that the CIT-owned portfolio, which continues to be managed by Snap-on Credit, is down to $35 million with the extended credit portion at $5 million.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $110.1 million in the quarter increased $18.4 million from $91.7 million last year. This quarter we made cash contributions of $10.4 million to our U.S. pension plans, including $10 million of discretionary contributions. Also in the quarter, in investing activities, cash of $52.5 million was used to support a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.7 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $18 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $70 million to $80 million.", "Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days was unchanged from 2012 year-end levels. Excluding the impact of currency, inventories increased $25 million, including inventories from the Challenger acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.8x compared with 3.9x at year end. Our quarter end cash position of $174.7 million reflects the year-to-date net funding of $74.4 million of finance receivables, share repurchases of $62.1 million, dividend payments of $44.4 million and the acquisition of Challenger for $38.2 million, as well as capital expenditures of $31.4 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income.", "Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.9% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year end. In addition to our $175 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.", "This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Our second quarter was encouraging. The Tools Group growing and getting stronger, franchisee health metrics trending positive, new products creating excitement across our customer base, volume up 7%, profits continuing their rise to 15.7%. C&I, challenged by ongoing headwinds but offsetting the impact of the volume decrease with strong operating performance. Sales were down but profits were up, with an OI margin at 12.6%. And RS&I, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, independent and OEM dealerships, maintaining encouraging levels of profitability, organic growth at 4.9% and profits at 23%, a coherent acquisition focused on repair shop owners and managers, brought onboard with positive effects.", "Overall, we believe the quarter's performance offers abundant evidence that the Snap-on future is playing out growth and improvement. And we believe we'll continue to advance along those 2 broad runways as we move forward throughout the year and into 2014. Before I close, I recognize that the encouraging results of the second quarter would not have been possible without our extraordinary franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening to this call, so for the success and progress you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your contribution, commitment and support, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker from Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Another continued progress here towards your goal ultimately, you're doing a great job. A couple of things here. As we look at C&I business, can you give us any color on the sequential performance there? I mean I understand the year-over-year, but are you seeing things stabilize when you look at it relative to Q1? Or are we still declining?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I think, you're looking at similar -- I think we would characterize it as not congruent but similar to Q1. I think I said in Q1 that the military would -- military still down big time, but it's operating on a somewhat lower base and that's the primary difference between the 6%. I think it was down 6.3% year-over-year in the first quarter. It's down, what, 5.4% in this quarter. That's the major player. You got some goes ins and goes outs in terms of, okay, from critical industries, one critical industry is up in the first quarter, and the stars are maybe mining in the second quarter, things like that. You got those things up and down. And then in Asia/Pacific, in the emerging markets you got, including Eastern Europe, you got some ups and downs in markets, but pretty much the same stuff. We are seeing another constant, though. A positive constant is that the effects of Snap-on value creation, I think, are working pretty well. And I think sequentially, the sales aren't much different but the profitability is higher. So that's looking pretty good. Whether we look at it sequentially or year-over-year, you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation working through, and you can see it actually, very dramatically in Europe, where the sales are down again high single-digits and the profits are up. So sort of a similar quarter for us.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And that well, too, for European tool business as well, that that is stabilizing here sequentially?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I'd say it's not decelerating downwards, yes, right, like it has been for a while. It's sort of stabilizing. We're not seeing worse news. I think that's a fair statement, yes.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then as we look at the tool business and you've had some great initiatives here over the last several years that drive productivity and sell more products to the van channel, it sounds like your starting to take that into your international market. Can you talk where you are in the timeline of that and whether we could see a similar response in those international markets that we've seen in the U.S. markets in recent years?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's very early days in that regard, so -- because the international markets are -- the vans are -- even though we kind of say the vans -- we talk about them as vans, the vans in England are slightly different than the vans in Australia, that are slightly different than the vans in U.S. So we're very early days in that. So I think you just got to stay tuned in that regard. Our van -- we're still building the marketing efforts. You can see, written on the face of the Tools Group financials, we're still spending more on marketing. For example, I think we've got, what is it, 42 Rock N' Roll vans now and that's up, and we're going to like 51 by the end of the third quarter. And we've got a new van called the techno-van [ph] . This is a -- remember that Rock N' Roll Cab Express was focused on tool storage so that it could kind of aid selling and tool storage where we have these new vans, 4 of them on the road now, which talk about diagnostics. Particularly the big-ticket diagnostics. You get on this thing, it's got flat screens all over the place. It allows the customer to kind of -- the shop owner or the technician to kind of work the thing on a big 16 by 9 screen so it's dramatic for them, and shows them all the features of the diagnostics. It's working pretty well for us. We have 4 of them now, we're going to, I think, about 10 by the end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Great quarter, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thank you. It's a -- I think this is a -- the OI margin was a high watermark -- the EPS is the high watermark. But you kind of -- when you're moving upwards, you kind of expect to have a high watermark every year. So...", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "A few questions for you, but before I ask my questions, I guess, the first one is just, once upon a time, 15% was kind of the target margin and I'm just wondering if at some point, we'll see a comfortable sort of talking about the next leg of your growth.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, okay, I know. But before we get overheated about the 15%, remember that I kind of said mid-teens, but for like a year. So I kind of think it's more or less a year. And I'll point out to everybody, like I do every second quarter call, that our third quarter has some seasonal issues to -- seasonal -- and I don't want to say issues, but seasonal headwinds in terms of the vacations in Europe, and the van drivers have got to take vacations some time, and they usually do it in the third quarter. So our third quarter is usually, I'm not saying -- I'm not forecasting bad news or anything. I'm just saying it's more imprecise and more capricious than other quarters. And I think if you look over history, it's usually our weaker quarter. So you kind of got to look at it over a full year basis.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. First question, just on the tools business, you talked about the strength in big ticket. That 7% organic growth, is there some way we could sort of bifurcate that between ticket and transaction? What was the growth from the average ticket?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't really want to get into it in that granularity. I'll just tell you that big ticket was substantially, well, bigger than the 7%. It was quite strong. But I don't want to tie myself to that wheel of explaining big ticket and small ticket in every quarter because there's a lot of variation. But I will tell you that we -- and the reason why I don't know if you recall this, but the reason why we focus on big ticket is we learned that it is an indicator of weakness of the economics in the marketplace because during the recession, we saw some really weak numbers in big ticket, people demurred or they decided not to purchase and the fact that we're seeing this makes us feel pretty good about the marketplace.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you say what big ticket represents as a percentage of the segment?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I don't know if I have that number actually, but I think you could say like between tool storage and big ticket diagnostics, my ballpark sausage math would say like a quarter, something like that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Or 25%?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "But -- no, that's helpful, that's helpful.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Of course, that's not [ph] detailed, but I'd say around that number.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And could you -- last quarter, you talked about sort of the 3-month pattern within the quarter. I wonder if I could get you to just address that again this quarter, how the 3-month pattern played out. Did you see strength at the end of the quarter, that was June...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "3-month -- well, we always see a little bit of strength at the end of the quarter. I don't know, I've been in business decades and I see this everywhere. And so you always see that kind of thing at the end of the quarter. But I'll tell you, it's what -- I wouldn't say it didn't happen like the first quarter. Remember what I said in the first quarter, I think, that I said the first quarter was dominated by the idea that things were very weak in the first couple of weeks of 2013. I think it had to do with uncertainty around sequestration and the -- what with the Social Security tax increase and the changes in the tax rates, and I think we've found that our customers were afflicted by the bad -- their perceived bad news for breakfast they were seeing every morning, and then we saw a build through the quarter. I'm not sure people thought -- kind of believe me, but I think this played out in the second quarter. Our Tools Group growth was at 3.5% or so on, or 3 and change in the first quarter, but we said it was stronger at the end, and I -- that growth carried on into the second quarter. But I wouldn't say in the second quarter, it was to the same extent as the first quarter. We didn't have some terrible time and then move on toward the end of the quarter.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Sounds like it was more linear. I wanted to ask...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. And I'll remind you that we -- despite the fact we got 7%, we always say that we've grown at 4% to 6% organically in the Tools Group, is towards the bottom of that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right. So then on the RCI achievements, can you just talk about how much RCI contributed to the quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I can talk about it in terms of -- I mean, let's not talk about in terms of OI or something like that. But let's say, if you look at our margin improvement, 120 basis points, right, you could say 110 of that is restructuring, sure, but there was the stock plan that cost you 50, 60 basis points. Challenger has a weaker profitability than average, that's a 10 and 40 for market. So you put those kind of negatives together, it's about 100. Between volume and RCI, you got another 110 positives. So I'd say RCI is 80, 90 basis points of positiveness.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Was it fair to say most of that was in Europe?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "A lot of it was in Europe, but I would say that we had good progress in a lot of different places. Our RS&I, which is not -- is only 25% Europe, had good RCI. And Tools Group made some RCI contributions, too, if you peel their results, you'd find it. So I think we saw it everywhere but more in Europe, to a greater degree in Europe.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Last question, though -- if you take the industrials business out of C&I and isolate that, so excluding Europe and excluding Asia and just talking about your critical industries, you obviously had a negative comp, a big negative comp in the military business. It sounds like mining was good. If you view those as a portfolio of businesses it sounds like they were up year-over-year. Can you talk about the extent to which they were up year-over-year, and the extent to which they...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I would just say they were up single digits year-over-year, if you take out the U.S. Military. You saw it, we got good news in mining, the international business, we're finding we're reaching out. The cool thing about that is we're now seeming to be able to project ourselves better in that business even to the international businesses, so we felt okay about that. I just want to clarify one thing, I'm sitting here thinking, what -- your question about big ticket, were you asking the total corporation or Tools Group?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I was thinking about Tools Group but any way you care to describe it [ph]...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Okay, I mean, I -- sorry, I gave you the total corporation. The Tools Group is more like 35%, 35% and change, yes, 35% to 40%, or something like that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "You were talking a lot about new products, that's all good. Are you kind of accelerating some new product introductions as you're growing here? I mean, you always had a goal of 40 new products with $1 million of sales or more. Has that been accelerated?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, it is. We're getting better at it. That's a simple point. I think our customer connection and our innovation, I think you've been to our Innovation Works, you can see where we -- we take customer observation up close to design and it's all part of Snap-on Value Creation Processes, but it didn't take -- Snap-on knew how to develop new products before, of course, and we had the idea of being in the workplace and observing it. But now we've boiled it down to repeatable and reliable processes and we get better at that. So we're getting better at documenting what we see, in other words, determining a sense of the practical, what's needed in the workplace. And then we're adding higher -- I don't want to say high tech because a lot of people have this stuff, but for us higher tech stuff like X-ray refractometers, and electron microscopes, and more use of finite element analysis, so we model in 3D printers, and that stuff. So we're sort of upgrading our engineering capability to more than it's ever been before. I'm not saying it's anything better than anybody else, but upgrading of where we had, and it's coming together for more new products. And I think I said that last year our new products, our hits that were $1 million sellers, were 6x or 7x what they were in 2006. So we're rolling out new products. And then I'll tell you what, this is an important thing because I was just on a van the other day, and I'm up here in Wisconsin, and a guy gets on the van and he says -- this is a guy who has been working for 25 years, the techs working on transmissions and I remember the guy's name, but I won't say it on the phone, is in our auto up here. And he says, jeez, I've got a huge number of ratchets, but look at these new ratchets, they're going to help me and save me a lot of time. So he bought 2 new ratchets, even though we had like 15 or 16 ratchets already. And so that's an important characteristic of our growth scenario, is that cars keep changing. And the faster we can bring out new cars guided by customer connection -- new products, new tools guided by customer connection, the better we grow, the more share we take. That was a good example of it the other day, and we're doing more of that.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Good. Good to hear. And then can you maybe just talk about Europe in terms of -- you had always said the Southern tier was weak, the Northern tier was holding its own. Are you seeing the Northern tier kind of slip here, talking about France, Germany? Lower [ph] countries?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, France. I don't like to hear the word France, makes me -- gives me headache now these days. It wasn't so good last quarter. So France, yes, you're right. I mean, I think -- I don't want to overplay Southern Europe. I mean, Southern Europe is getting so small for us. It's getting a lesser and lesser factor, but Southern Europe was down but the core Europe, France, was down pretty -- was week this quarter. Benelux was weak. Germany was a little better, the U.K. was better, Sweden was weaker. In general, you're right. If you talk about year-over-year comparison, South got a little better, the core got a little worse, the periphery was good. So like I said, we feel good about Europe because -- about our SNA Europe business because one, we're not taking capacity down yet we're finding RCI improvements. We're finding productivity improvements so we have higher profitability on lower sales; and two, we haven't dismantled the value-creating nature of the business because anybody who has money that is in the periphery, places like Russia and Northern Africa and so on, and the Middle East, they're buying. So that's an endorsement that what's happening in Europe was still pretty strong, they're just waiting for the markets to come back.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So the last question would be in terms of the emerging markets. You'd always said that that was 5% to 10% of sales. I would assume that that's trending closer to the 10%? Or has it exceeded that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "It's over 10% now. It's over -- it's just over -- it's a slice over 10%. Of course, you realize our numbers aren't that precise and so on and all these, but it's over 10%. So we're moving upwards.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Nick, you talked about the profitability step-up in the C&I segment in Europe. Looking at the critical industries business without Europe, do you still see a gross margin step-up as well in the rest of the segment?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, you see productivity improvements, of course. We spend in that segment to try to extend into Europe, for example. The idea, I think in my remarks, I talked about international aviation business as you know. And so if you just strip back the core business, you'll like the profitability of it. On the other hand, we have, like in the Tools Group, we have an overlay of spending to talk about penetration, but still I like the profitability of the business.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And you made the Challenger acquisition this quarter. Is the pipeline continuing to be healthy there on the acquisition front?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure. Yes. I mean, I think it's -- the Challenger is a great poster child for the type acquisition we'd make, not necessarily the size, although it's not a bad -- we like that size, but it doesn't mean we wouldn't do bigger, but it's right down our wheelhouse, we think, about giving us more to sell to one of our key customer bases. So we have a series of acquisitions that we keep looking at and Challenger was, I guess, the first one we've done in a while after the, I guess, credit company. I like to say the credit company being an acquisition, given that it was $800 million or so. And yes, we have a pipeline. We continue to work on it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Adam Brooks with Sidoti & Company.", "Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "Just a few quick questions here. Given your performance in C&I in the last few quarters, do you have a more optimistic view on the long-term margin? Can we get to that mid-teen range just within the segment, or has nothing really changed and this is kind of what you've been expecting?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'm not quite sure. Let me try to answer what I think you asked me. I see this as a mature, a mid-teens -- I think I've always said, how I've done this, I've said, look we're going to the mid-teens, the components of that will be the RS&I group up around the 20s, the Tools Group kind of around the mid-group and C&I hanging around a little bit below that, but not -- but approaching mid-teens, and I have full confidence that that's the case. I mean, C&I, we're kind of happy about the C&I quarter. The 12.6% is pretty strong if you look at historical performance of C&I, and yet it's taken all these hits from the headwinds. I mean, that's headwinds city for us. You got Europe. You've got the military. It's a tougher place to be these days but they perform pretty well. So I see them moving on up. I'm not saying next quarter or something like that, but I just think the opportunities are very clear and we're confident in those businesses.", "Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "Okay, and then maybe just a little bit on Challenger now that you have it under your belt just for a few months, maybe some color on any opportunities that you see now, anything that's gotten you a little bit more excited.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, I think, funny, when you acquire somebody, all of a sudden when you're touring these garages, you start noticing the names on the list more, and I was just, like I said, I was on a truck the other day, and it seemed like every garage had Challenger Lifts and I know that's not the case. They're not the largest lift manufacturer. So I think, one, talking to technicians, I found that it has a -- it reinforced my idea of great reputation. That's one thing. Secondly, we have opportunities to roll that business out into international. It's not an international business now, but we have equipment selling in international markets in Europe and in particularly Asia, so we're very excited about the opportunity to take that product portfolio and spread it into those places. And it's pretty important about emerging markets because you see, emerging markets they're building new brick and mortar all the time around auto repair garages, and the first thing that gets thought of when you're putting brick-and-mortar in your automotive repair garages is the lift. So if you have a strong line up there, it gives you a leg up in selling. We like that. So we're pretty excited about it.", "Adam Brooks - Sidoti & Company, LLC", "And do you think now, being under the Snap-on umbrella, you can bring the margins up on that business? Or are they where you think they're going to be?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I mean, I hope we can bring the margins up. I think we -- that's why we have Snap-on value creation. We think Snap-on value creation is safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, imprinted on any operation makes it better. So one of the things we've always said about our, I think, have said about our acquisition strategy, is we acquire somebody coherent, so we get the synergies around sort of strategic alignment. It helps us with our customer base. But that doesn't diminish the idea that we have opportunities to make almost any operation better. We're confident of that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Over in Europe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, since that market is down as much as it is, what's your experience with the franchisees over there? How do you motivate the group? Are you seeing many of them fold up? And also curious about, are you seeing many of the independent mechanic shops closing up, too?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Okay. Let's talk about this. Europe is a little bit bifurcated. Let me kind of give you the landscape, remind you of the landscape a little bit. The franchisees, overwhelmingly in Europe, are concentrated in England because our van business mostly works where technicians own their own tools. So the places -- the place in Europe where they own their own tools is the U.K. That business has not been as affected by the downturn. It's had its weak moments but it isn't as -- it didn't have as much problems as the other businesses. And so, therefore -- having said that, though, we have worked very hard to make sure that our franchisee population stays the same. So the franchisee, we haven't seen any huge downturn in the franchisees in the U.K. And so that's maintained robust. We have some vans in places like Germany and Netherlands, but they're not really that weak -- they're not really that big. Most of the business in Europe is the direct and distributor business which we sell through SNA Europe and our other divisions, not the Tools Group division. And you remember that C&I is 33% Europe, RS&I is 25% Europe. They're way above the Tools Group. And so those businesses have been impacted. But they're broader-based and not just -- C&I is the -- the C&I business is another -- is an industry and culture and a lot of other different things. Now what we've noticed is, in Europe, that our customers we sell to distributors, our customers have not gone away. So it appears to us that the base, the customer base, is still intact. So the long and short of this is, I guess the long and short of my answer, is that we don't see any deterioration in the opportunity in Europe. We see the customer base still there. We believe the morale of our people are still pretty high because there's nothing like seeing your sales down and your profits up. You feel pretty good about it, so they feel strong. And because we believe in the opportunities going forward, it's why through all this restructuring, through all the RCIs, through all the restructuring we did in Europe, we didn't take out any capacity. That's one thing we demanded in terms of the restructuring plan. We demanded that no capacity go out. We reduced based on being able to do the same with more during this period. So I hope that answers your question.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. U.K., new car sales are actually up there versus the rest of the Europe which has been down most of the year. So I would imagine that you're still seeing fairly good business in the U.K. then?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. The U.K -- look, the Tools Group was up, I think, about the same internationally as it was in the U.S. But the U.K. might have been at the, like at the lower end of that, but still up pretty good, like 4%, 5%, something like that. So still, I think, good.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. On the CapEx, you've been running -- the run rates have been pretty low compared to what the full year expectation is. It's been 1.8%, 1.9% for the first and second quarters, percent of revenue, and your full year run rate is -- the $70 million, $80 million comes out to something like maybe 2.3% to 2.6% of revenue. We're going to see the third quarter and the fourth quarter being high 2%, low 3% spend?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I suppose. Look, I don't actually think of it that way. I kind of think that we're thinking about -- we have, what, 31.5% or so year-to-date. So okay, I think we still like a 70 to 80 number. There's a lot of variation from quarter to quarter on these things. And I still think the 70 number -- 70 to 80 is a decent number to forecast. So if that means going up in the second half, yes [ph] .", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Is there anything in particular in the second half of the year in terms of capital spending, any one big project or something that's ramping up?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. I don't think...", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "It's fairly broad-based. We have investments both in the U.S. and the international arena earmarked for the second half. It's pretty broad-based.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Yes, and then one last question. A large part of your success is your ability to bring out new product and be in tune with what the market needs, having new technologies or having new tools that meet a certain criteria that the market wants. And I was curious to know, do you have any kind of information or analysis on, say, the percentage of your product portfolio that is new over a certain time frame?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I do not. I think, look, everybody has a different view of this. But for me, I don't like -- I'm not a big fan of that metric. The metric we like is, and now I'll tell you why we like it, is a tool that sells $1 million in the first year. And the reason is because when you ride these vans, what you see is a new tool, the guys get on the van and get excited. And okay, they buy the new tool but then they buy a whole bunch of other stuff, too. So it drags other products with it. So for us it's a matter of not how many new products there are, but how many exciting new products or how many products make the hit parade. That's what I was talking to Gary Prestopino before, and so that's what we measure. And as I said, the number of new products last year that sold over $1 million in the first year, and we're pretty strict about this, was up 6x to 7x from 2006. So our innovation process and our customer connection process are improving. It's our life blood. Because if you think about this, we guarantee a lot of our tools for life, so how is it we have a business? And the reason is is because the guy needs, instead of 16 ratchets, he needs 18, because the cars change. That's the biggest driver in our business and that fits in with this innovation. And so, we seem to be doing better on that. So the metric I like to offer is, tools over $1 million, and that was over 50 last year.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Over 50 last year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, over 50, you got it [ph].", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "In 2012? Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "2012, yes.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sarah Hunt with Alpine.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC", "Quick -- a couple quick questions for you. One, you mentioned that you were doing fairly well with auto OE repair shops. So are you taking share from somebody? Or is that market just getting better?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think you would have to say some of both. We'd like to think we're taking share. It's hard -- Sarah, it's hard to assess share in this space because we're basically 65,000 SKUs. Okay, if you add 3,000 more, is that taking share? I don't know. You see what I mean? And so, I think we do believe, though, our sales are getting better in these shops, we're selling more to each individual shops, the franchisees and the individual sales. Franchisees are selling more, the individual salesmen are selling more. So we believe we're taking some share.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC", "Okay. And then the next question is on interest rates. So we've seen a lot of movement in the last 4 weeks or so, based on various interpretations of what the Fed is going to do. For your own financing piece of the business, how rapidly do you need to or have to adjust as interest rates change? Or how are you looking at that now that you've got the finance portfolio as internal?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Sarah, this is Aldo. I think that actually we have a little bit of a headroom, I believe, in the interest rate arena. And the reason I say that is our finance receivables and contract receivables tend to be of relatively high interest rates in the market, reflective of the credit profile of the customers that we serve. And our philosophy is we finance the credit company long. And what I mean by that, if you look at our pro forma statements that are attached to the earnings release, we use the Snap-on average all in debt expense rate and that's at about 5.6% more or less at the end of June. So we don't use floating rate debt to really finance the receivable portfolio. And if today, if we had issued 10-year paper as an example, I'm guessing the rate would be about 3.6-ish, somewhere around that neighborhood. So you'd see, we still have 200 basis points of headroom before I think that our cost of funds would start to impact squeezing the spread of what we charge customers and what we pay.", "Sarah Hunt - Alpine Woods Capital Investors, LLC", "Okay, and that would really be a temporary, I'm guessing sort of a temporary issue, if rates are going up. I mean, unless they're steadily going up and you're chasing it, I would think that you're probably -- that, that would -- as rates go up, that gets reflected on what you charge folks. Is it not?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Sure, it would be. I think it would be a little bit of a lag effect because in some situations that we do charge rates that are sometimes the highest rates allowed by law depending on the circumstances and the profile of the customer, and those laws change probably on a lag basis, I'm going to guess, versus the open free-market rates.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "So this is Leslie Kratcoski. I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and, as always, for your interest in Snap-on. A replay of this will be available shortly on snapon.com. Thanks a lot, and have a great day.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's call.

Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter 2013 results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website, along with a transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during the call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filing.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start by covering some of the highlights of our third quarter, and I'll provide an update on the general environment and on the trends of our business. Aldo will then give a detailed review of the financials.", "Our third quarter, it was encouraging. We again showed progress along our runways, both for growth and for improvement. Our sales were up 5.8% from last year, reflecting a 4.7% organic rise, as well as a $15.6 million increase related to Challenger Lifts, which you'll recall, earlier this year, was acquired for our undercar equipment portfolio. Our operating margin before financial services was 14.8%, up 130 basis points from the last year's 13.5%. When you add the $31.6 million in operating earnings from financial services, which was up from $27.9 million in 2012, the consolidated operating margin was 17.9%. And EPS was $1.43, also up from the $1.26 achieved last year.", "From a broad perspective, our automotive repair related businesses continue to be well positioned. You can see that with another quarter of mid to high single digit gains in both the Tools Group and in the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. For Commercial & Industrial or the C&I Group, where our major headwinds have been the most pronounced, the third quarter, it did offer some evidence of an improving environment.", "Now military activity, which is being held back by troop withdrawals and budgetary constraints, did remain a substantial headwind. Outside of that isolated sector, we saw a generally better year-over-year comparisons throughout the remainder of C&I. Importantly, that's also true for our European hand tools business, SNA Europe. You remember that this is an area that's been a substantial headwind for quite some time. Well, in the third quarter, SNA Europe was down only slightly, a significant upgrade from the deeper downturns in past periods and encouraging evidence of possible stabilization in that region.", "So I'd summarize the overall environment like this, the challenges of the military cutbacks continue, and of course, the situation in Washington creates a further overhang for the military. That's difficult to predict. But our areas of strength are holding firm, and the European contraction, one of our primary headwinds, appears to be abating. But economic environment notwithstanding, we believe that by focusing on 4 defined and decisive areas: enhancing the franchise network, expanding in the garage, building in emerging markets and extending into critical industries, we will continue to move down our runways for growth and maintain our long-term encouraging trend.", "Paired with those growth drivers, we also have our Snap-on Value Creation processes: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. These are the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement and growth. I believe that this quarter's results demonstrate clearly the progress we're making in each of those dimensions.", "Consider customer connection and innovation, Snap-on has again, in 2013, won 3 MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards. This year's winners were our AC400 touchless wheel clamp that greatly limits rim damage; the VERUS PRO diagnostic unit, our top of the line handheld; and the new flip socket that incorporates an 8-millimeter and 10-millimeter socket all into one tool.", "I've spoken about each of these products in the past, but I mentioned the award because this is just the latest accolade for the long list of what we call hip new products, those that sell more than $1 million in the first year. They drive excitement with our customers, and they author our growth. You see, Snap-on has unique customer connection advantage, over 4,800 vans calling on well over 1 million technicians worldwide and many more direct salespeople calling on thousands of critical workplace. And we translate that unique insight into winning innovation. And all of that, all of that worked for us in the third quarter.", "With that backdrop, let's turn to the discussion of the segments. C&I's organic sales were down 0.9% from last year. Actually, that comparison is quite a bit better than the 5% to 6% declines we had in each period starting in the fourth quarter last year. What did remain consistent is the double digit decline in military activity. As I said, however -- said before, however, in the third quarter, SNA Europe's comparison got better and the other operations provided more offset. But again, this quarter, in spite of the declines -- overall decline in sales, operating income was up by $2.6 million or 120 basis points to $36 million, up 120 basis points despite the sales decline to 13.1% of sales. I believe the profit increase in the face of the overall sales drop is clear evidence that RCI is working well at C&I, in Commercial & Industrial.", "Aside from the European and military activity that I've already mentioned, C&I also includes those businesses that are responsible for the lion's share of the growth initiatives, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets of Asia Pacific, and we did see important progress. Related to Asia, we saw some nice increases. Our businesses in China and Korea and Thailand posted notable upward movement in the quarter. Both hand tools and undercar equipment made clear progress across the region, with the equipment activity confirming the capabilities of our recently opened undercar plant in Kunshan. Some of you have visited there.", "In our industrial division, the extension into our critical natural resources sector provides -- has been providing favorable offset to the military declines, with much of that activity also spurring international growth. Our expanding offering of tools, brought together into specialized kits and paired with unique tool control solution, is building our presence in oil and gas operations on land and on sea in Mexico, in South America, in the Middle East and in the U.S., in multiple geographies.", "Also related to critical industries, Snap-on's got a -- has a large and growing presence in technical schools all across America. You see, we believe that having future professionals trained with Snap-on products provides another important customer connection advantage. With continuing graduations and with new classes entering, the third quarter always provides important insight into our progress in the education sector, and we did see gains in this period. With our broadening certification programs, we partner with schools to develop curricula. The schools use our tools and equipment in their labs. We gain additional insight that helps guide our product innovation, and along the way we make the students customers for life, building a reservoir for sales as we go forward. That's C&I. That provides a bit of color on C&I.", "Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 9.5% from last year, with the gains coming from all geographies. Operating income in the quarter was 41.9% compared to $40.2 million in the -- $41.9 million compared to $40.2 million in 2012. The operating margin was 12.6% compared with 13% last year, reflecting increased investment in focused activities that are enhancing our van network and driving that substantial growth. I'll remind you that even through the downturn of 2009, we made it a priority to strengthen the franchise channel, and we believe there's substantial evidence that we did just that.", "The health metrics we monitor each period, whether it's franchisee profitability, turnover or delinquencies, are all broadly favorable. And certainly, the growth rates for this business over an extended period speak to abundant strength and to widening advantage. But beyond the numbers, beyond those numbers, there's observable qualitative evidence of forward momentum. Take this year's franchisee conference held in Nashville during August, it was even more successful. Now that's a barometer that indicates our franchisees are more positive than ever.", "These conferences are part selling show, part training seminar and part pep rally, and the recent edition and -- at Nashville was the biggest and most enthusiastic yet. I'll also point out that the franchisees pay their own way to come, taking time away from their home and from their businesses. So in that context, the more than 10% rise in attendance speaks to the state of the business and the height of the network's confidence. I'll also tell you that our orders were up even more than the attendance. It's not only an indication of franchisee optimism, but it's also an endorsement of our innovative product offerings.", "I often speak of the new products that enable sales, and that's certainly the case with our array of productivity-enhancing handheld diagnostic units. And that lineup we've had quite a string of hits, the SOLUS Ultra in 2011; the VERUS PRO in 2012; and this year, the ETHOS Plus; the MICROSCAN 3 and our new MODIS Ultra, all making the repair job easier and faster and driving van sales gains.", "There's also a number of highly successful and creative marketing and customer connection initiatives driving our sales gain, most notably, related to the tools -- most notably, related to the tool storage units the -- our Rock 'N Roll Cab Express, traveling showrooms that have been a big part of higher sales, and we keep expanding our fleet of those game-changing selling aids. And I believe I mentioned last quarter, we've launched another marketing support vehicle, our techno van, bringing sophisticated diagnostic expertise and demonstrations right to the point of sale. We kicked that program off in the second quarter, and it kept right on expanding. Rock N' Roll cabs, techno vans, we're finding effective ways, very effective ways to enhance the power of the van network and the sales. They -- it's working.", "Finally, related to the van channel, I'd be missing a huge competitor and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit. Many of those innovative products, the largest ticket items, are financed. In that way, Snap-on Credit is a big growth enabler. And as you would expect, the credit operation had a strong presence at the franchisee conference in Nashville, providing effective training, teaching franchisees to wield credit more strongly, and making our finance activity an even greater strategic contributor. So that's tools.", "Now to the RS&I Group. Total sales were up 13.7%, including a 6.7% organic increase and a $15.6 million increase from the Challenger Lift acquisition. The operating margin at 22.9% rose from 22.3% last year, another testimony to the power of RCI. If you want to talk about Snap-on value creation, rapid continuous improvement to customer connection to innovation, RS&I is a great example. RS&I is charged with expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, and there was broad expansion. We again had strong growth in our businesses providing repair and -- repair information and diagnostics to independents, and we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive, medium and heavy duty -- in automotive, medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both those independent repair shops as well as OEM dealerships, all fueled by our expanding product line.", "First I'll note that 2 of the MOTOR Top 20 winners were developed within RCI -- 4 of those shop customers. But when you're speaking of RS&I new products, there's much, much more. Let me give you a few highlights. Our new MODIS Ultra handheld, well targeted by customer connection, combining the fast operation and functionality of our highly successful SOLUS Ultra, but with added capabilities, such as a graphing meter and scope at an attractive price. It includes a larger touchscreen, a faster processor, expert information, an array of guided component tests and the battery charges while it's hooked up to the vehicle, a very, very popular feature. Early reception has been strong, and it looks like it's going to be a big hit.", "New products are also fueling global expansion in RS&I. We're just launching our first handheld diagnostic unit for Brazil, the PDL 4000. We've done it by leveraging information from across RS&I. We've been able to localize -- by doing that, we've been able to localize vehicle information and cover the majority of the Brazilian car part. The result has been an effective unit available at an attractive price, and we expect it's going to help us build a bigger position in an emerging market. It's already doing some of that.", "For the U.S. automotive shops, Mitchell 1 launched an update to our ProDemand repair information suite. It features a revised user dashboard that allows technicians and their customers easy access and better visibility to maintenance service schedules. It's an upgrade that will support improved shop productivity and profitability, and it will be popular.", "A word about heavy-duty truck shops, where we continue to make good gains with our repair information. That's where we recently launched a new Pocket iQ light diagnostic software product. It's the must-have tool for the aftermarket, developed and ideally suited for truck shops performing preventive maintenance. It monitors essential engine signals, and it even has the capability to adjust some basic vehicle settings.", "We've also seen some nice movement serving the automotive OEMs in their dealerships. Just in the past quarter, we expanded our electronic parts catalog capabilities and began wider relationships with large OEMs reaching beyond North America and Europe into several of today's emerging markets, a big breakthrough.", "Finally, we just launched a new V3400 wheel aligner, developed using our customer connection and innovation processes, specifically designed for high-end independent and OEM garages. It includes wireless communication that provides flexibility and simplifies installation, has smaller and lighter targets, resulting in space and ease-of-use advantages. And it incorporates our award-winning touchless wheel clamp that eliminates wheel damage. We believe it represents another winning product for RS&I and equipment expansion. So there are a lot of activities, big and small. But all important to our gains in serving garage owners and managers, and you can see it in this quarter's results.", "Well, that's the highlights of our third quarter. Organic sales up 4.7% despite the headwinds; the Challenger acquisition contributing well; progress along each of our runways for growth; and the Snap-on value creation driving us down our runway for improvement; OI margin up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick, and good morning to all those on the call.", "Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $753.2 million in the quarter increased $41.6 million or 5.8% from 2012 levels. On an organic basis, sales increased 4.7%, excluding $15.6 million of sales from Challenger Lifts and an unfavorable $7.3 million impact from foreign currency translation. The year-over-year organic sales increase primarily reflects continued higher sales in the Snap-on Tools Group, along with increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products, as well as higher sales to OEM dealerships. These sales increases more than offset lower sales to the military and slightly lower sales in our European-based hand tool business.", "Consolidated gross profit of $364.3 million increased $23.9 million from 2012 levels. Gross margin of 48.4% improved 60 basis points, largely due to savings from ongoing rapid continuous improvement, or RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $253 million increased $8.8 million, and the operating expense margin of 33.6% improved 70 basis points from 34.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, savings from ongoing RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Total restructuring costs in the quarter of $1.7 million compared with $2.3 million last year.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $111.3 million in the quarter increased 15.7% and as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 14.8%. Operating earnings from financial services of $31.6 million increased 13.3% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of $142.9 million increased 15.1% over 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 17.9% improved 140 basis points from 16.5% a year ago.", "Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 32.6% compares with 32.3% last year. We continue to expect that our full year 2013 effective tax rate will be comparable to our 2012 full year rate of 32.8%. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $84.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $74.1 million or $1.26 per share last year, representing a 13.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $275.2 million were down 0.9% organically from 2012 levels, primarily due to a double digit decline in sales to the military, coupled with a slight decline in sales in the segment's European-based hand tools business. As Nick mentioned, our C&I business in Europe is showing some signs of stabilization, which is encouraging.", "Gross profit in the C&I Group totaled $104.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.1% improved 110 basis points from 37% last year, primarily due to savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, particularly in Europe. Operating expenses of $68.8 million in the quarter declined $1.5 million from prior year levels, primarily due to lower restructuring costs, and the operating expense margin of 25% improved slightly from 25.1% last year. As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings of $36 million for the C&I segment increased $2.6 million from 2012 levels, and the operating margin of 13.1% improved 120 basis points from 11.9% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $333.8 million increased 9.5% organically, reflecting increases across both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $142.8 million increased $11.5 million from 2012 levels, and the gross margin of 42.8% improved 30 basis points from 42.5% last year.", "Operating expenses of $100.9 million in the quarter increased $9.8 million from 2012 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses including focused investment in growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchise network. The operating expense margin of 30.2% increased 70 basis points from 29.5% last year. Accordingly, operating earnings of $41.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $1.7 million over prior year levels. The third quarter operating margin of 12.6% compared with 13% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $252.7 million increased 13.8% from 2012 levels, including $15.6 million of sales from the Challenger acquisition. Excluding the Challenger sales and $0.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales in the quarter increased $14.9 million or 6.7%, primarily due to a double digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products and a high single digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships.", "Gross profit of $116.7 million in the quarter increased $11.3 million over prior year levels. Gross margin of 46.2% reflects a 130 basis point decrease from 2012 levels, primarily due to the impact of lower gross margin Challenger products, partially offset by continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses totaled $58.8 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 190 basis points from 2012 levels, primarily due to contributions from sales volume leverage, including the impact of the sale of Challenger products that have a lower operating expense ratio and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings of $57.9 million for the RS&I Group increased $8.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 22.9% increased 60 basis points from 22.3% last year.", "Now turning to Slide 10. In the third quarter, earnings from financial services increased 13.3%, and originations of $205 million rose 14.2% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter increased 11.4%, primarily due to continued growth of the financial services portfolio and higher average yields. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.4% in the quarter increased 30 basis points from 17.1% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.6% in the quarter increased 10 basis points from 2012 levels.", "Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation and $182 million from our international finance subsidiaries. In the U.S., $813 million or approximately 80% of the financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. Year-to-date, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew approximately $121 million. For the 2013 full year, we anticipate that the portfolio will increase by approximately $135 million over 2012 year-end levels. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $84.3 million in the quarter increased $14.6 million from $69.7 million last year. There were no discretionary contributions to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter as compared to last year, when we made a $16 million discretionary U.S. pension contribution. Investing activities in the quarter included cash used of $34.3 million support a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.3 million in the quarter compared with capital expenditures of $19.7 million last year. We expect that full year capital expenditures will approximate $75 million.", "Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 62 days compares to 61 days at 2012 year end. Excluding currency impacts, inventories increased $41.9 million from 2012 levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand with improved service levels, new product introductions and inventories related to the Challenger acquisition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7x compared with 3.9x at year end.", "Our quarter end cash position of $182.5 million reflects the year-to-date net funding of $108.7 million of finance receivables, share repurchases of $67.5 million, dividend payments of $66.5 million, the acquisition of Challenger for $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $50.7 million. These uses of cash were largely offset by $270.1 million of cash generated from operations, including higher levels of net income. Our net debt to capital ratio of 28.6% compares to 29.7% at 2012 year-end.", "In addition to our $182 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, including our recently concluded 5-year revolving credit facility. Our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we choose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.", "This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. I would say the third quarter is more confirmation on the strength of our business model and on the opportunities available along our runways. Of course, there are headwinds. The military is turbulent, and Europe, though stabilizing, is not yet cured. But despite those challenges, our sales in the period were up 5.8%. We are moving down our runways for growth. Rock 'N Roll cabs and techno vans enhancing the van network, the Challenger acquisition and new diagnostic product reaching more shops, our success in oil and gas and in creating customers for life, our growing presence in places like China and Brazil, all of that is compelling testimony to our ongoing growth potential and to our progress in taking advantage of those abundant opportunities.", "And we're also moving down our runway for improvement. C&I and SNA Europe, higher profitability despite lower sales. And the overall corporation and op co OI margin of 14.8%, up 130 basis points, clear evidence of Snap-on value creation and its ongoing benefits. We are encouraged by the third quarter results, achieved against challenge, but we believe that substantial opportunity remains and that our favorable trends and long-term progress will continue as we move forward.", "Before I turn the call to questions, it's appropriate that I recognize those who made these results possible, our franchisees and associates. Once again -- I know many of you always listen to this call. I know you're listening today. For your extraordinary skill in driving our progress, you have my admiration. And for your extraordinary commitment and dedication to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions. I want to start with on the Snap-on Tools business, and it's nice to see the strong organic growth across all the businesses here in the quarter. I wanted to zero in on the SG&A number here. I mean I think, if I look at the numbers correctly, the SG&A as a percent of that segment sales have been falling or declining, and this is a change from that pattern. So are these the incremental initiatives of what you've been doing, just more of them or broadening them geographically? Can you help some color -- give us some color there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Sure. Look, I think the thing is the principal activity here is the investments in the -- what we would broadly say, our actions which are breaking through the structural disadvantages of the van. One easy one to remember -- you'll all remember is the Rock 'N Roll cab. The van is constrained by size. You can only put a couple of tool storage boxes on them, therefore, the Rock 'N Roll cabs allow -- add more marketing space at the point of sale from time to time. It breaks through it. It drives more sales. We've gone up. I think the number that we have almost 50, over -- we were in the 40s last time and -- about 40 of them last quarter. So we've gone up quite a bit. In fact, we're in the 30s last time. So you see that. And then this time, we're launching the techno vans. Last time, I think we had 3 or 4 at the end of the quarter, now we have 10. And the techno vans are diagnostics, and there is quite a bit of training around this. Not only are the vans heavily facilitized because you have all of the equipment on the vans, which help you demonstrate the diagnostics to their fullest, but there's a lot of training associated with the van drivers themselves because you have to have guys on those vans that have to make the diagnostics sit up and do dog tricks. And then there are a number of other things in there this quarter, smaller items, which have helped us in that regard. And then I would offer the idea that the SFC was bigger and better than ever before, and we had 10% more, 10% more attendance. That 10% drives more expense. And in fact, we planned it to be bigger with more training and more selling and so on, and more sales space. And all of that rolls up to an investment. Actually, from our perspective, I'm very encouraged by this because what I view it as -- I would classify it in the old football saw as run to daylight. We've asked the Tools Group to -- when they see opportunity, to run to it, to the spend to take advantage of it, and that's what they've been doing. And it's been resulting pretty well. If you look at the Tools Group's numbers, David, over the last several quarters, the third quarters are like this. In 2010, they were up 10.5%. '11, they were up 6%, 11.1% last year, so this wasn't an easy comparison. They were up 9.5% again. So we're not so worried about the SG&A. We like the idea of spending to get those sales.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. That's useful. And then your tool business is up close to 10%, Stanley yesterday said that Mac Tools was up close to 10%. It's hard for you 2 players to be growing that -- take that much market share. So are these finding ways to get to more customers out there who haven't been accessed before? And I'm talking about the 2 of you combined here because the market just isn't growing that fast, is it?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't think so. I can't speak to their number. I think they said they were up high single digits. I don't know what the exact number was, so I am...", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "High single digits.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, right. So I'm not sure exactly what the number is. There are a number of things that can flow through in terms of the different products that can be selling and the sources of those products that will result in driving Stanley sales, depending on how they come out on the Mac vans. The market is nice, but we're pretty sure that we are reaching more customers and selling more to the same customers. I can tell you that our van drivers are more excited about our proposition. I was just in Saratoga, New York, riding around on a van with Greg Dolan [ph] up there, and he was very enthusiastic about our products and its prospects. And his customers were positive about what he does for them. So we feel very good about both those engines driving the tools sales, reaching more people and also selling more to the same customers. That's what's happening in both of these places. And part of it is productivity giving the van driver more time to sell, reaching more customers; and two, breaking through some of the structural disadvantages like space and technical expertise that can only -- that one man can only have so much technical expertise on the van, and that's been driving this increase.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then one last item on the C&I segment, on the military. Q4 -- I know your business had been declining already last year going into Q4, but the fourth quarter was the first big decline. So anniversary-ing around that, is there a way you can characterize your Q3 military volumes versus what they were in Q4 of last year? Is that flattening out? Are we still seeing declines? And I know overall, it's a small piece.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I hate to comment on any kind of trajectory around the military given the turbulence in Washington these days. Who knows where it's going. I mean, look, we had a -- the fourth quarter has always been our biggest quarter. We took a big shot in that, the fourth quarter last year. I had said that we're going to see -- I know I said on these calls that we're going to have probably lighter comparisons going forward. Yes, but the atmosphere gets -- got worse and worse, and so we've been seeing some big headwinds -- maybe not as big as the fourth quarter, but some big headwinds in the third quarter as well, third quarter of this year, not as big as the fourth quarter last year, but still pretty significant that's moving the needle.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I've got a question on the Tools Group with the solid growth there. Could you maybe categorize or break that out between U.S. -- and I guess, it's -- U.K. is where you have the franchise business. Was a lot of this the U.K. snapping back more strongly than...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. Yes, go ahead. Finish your question.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "No, go ahead. That's fine.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, if you look at it broadly, if you look at it broadly, international, U.S., kind of the same, Gary, kind of the same. If you landscape the international business -- as you know, for the Tools Group like Canada, U.K., Australia and so on, we had some goes-ins and goes-outs. The U.K. was up nicely as well. In fact, our overall business, if you roll it all together, one of the things we're kind of happy about in terms of our -- one of the things that's positive -- we're happy about is the U.K. actually did snap back, but it's not driving -- our overall business in the U.K., including SNA Europe and the Tools Group and other businesses that sell in the U.K., are up double digits. But for the Tools Group, it's not driving that -- not influencing that 9.5%, not influencing it. It's in that ballpark.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "In terms of -- could you maybe talk about or give us some metrics surrounding growth in the emerging markets, and what percentage of your sales that is now?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, it's north of 10% now, I'd say in low double digits, you'd say, now. And every quarter, you get kind of -- because you're spread over lots of emerging markets, you get kind of goes-in and goes-outs. We had -- as I said, I think, in the script, we had a good quarter in China, good quarter in China, nice quarter in Thailand, good one in Korea. We had a fine quarter in Brazil. Some of the others were weaker. For example, the Philippines was weak for us this year. But in general, we're at 11% -- not 11%, but it's the low single digits and we're growing.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then could you just remind me, Aldo, the finance receivables versus contract receivables, what's the difference there?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "A finance receivable, Gary, is when Snap-on Credit finances an end customer who is a customer of the franchisees, so in other words, a technician, a mechanic out on the shop floor. A contract receivable is when Snap-on directly finances a garage shop owner or a franchisee themselves. So the receivable is directly between Snap-on and the party versus a third party.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Congratulations on the award during the quarter to MOTOR Magazine. That was good accomplishment, but something that -- obviously with the technology is something that isn't out of the realm of possibilities. I wanted to ask about the restructuring costs. Was any of that in the Tools segment? Or was all of it in the C&I segment?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Very little actually in this quarter.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "I'd say it's -- Roger (sic) [Richard], Aldo here. It was a little bit in the RS&I segment actually and then the Commercial & Industrial Group. There was a smidgen, so to speak, in the Tools Group.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "So this wasn't really a big restructuring quarter for us.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Right. It was $1.7 million, you said?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Right.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "That's correct. Overall, it was $1.7 million as compared to $2.3 million for the corporation last year.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "All right, okay. With the shutdown that we just experienced in the government, will there be any impact from that in any kind of government contracts that you might have in the fourth quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, I don't know. I mean the thing is, is that I think you can speculate yourself. First of all, we usually -- we don't give guidance or anything like that, but look, we have a military business. I would say anybody who's got direct business with the government would be wondering whether it would be effect going forward. But they did solve the problem now, so whether that plays out quickly enough to eliminate any overhang, I'm not so sure. What I would say though is that through the quarters we've had, we've seen an overhang from sequestration in the military business and the government business, and it's hard to predict whether that will get positive -- whether that will get more negative as we go forward. I would suppose, if this is not solved and they don't snap back quickly, it could get more negative. But I think that's very shaky, shaky to predict. We've been dealing with a kind of difficulty in that area for some time.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. One last question. The inner segment eliminations for revenues went up quite a bit this quarter. Just curious what was the activity there that drove that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, it tends to revolve around the SFC, the Snap-on Franchisee Conference, where you bring all these guys together, the franchise -- remember, I said it's part selling show. They order, some of those sales get in the quarter. And what that means is some of the other segments, for example, the diagnostics groups or the C&I Group will provide products, they provide products to the Tools Group, and that tends to ramp up during this period. And that's what you're seeing in here.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Nick, you talked about emerging markets in the C&I business picking up some of the slack, where you had other areas of weakness. Is it the same end markets? Is it oil and gas in emerging markets? Or is it some other critical industry?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, no. It's broad, broad. And when we say emerging markets, we really mean the whole Shamil [ph], like automotive, automotive repair. We would call automotive repair, by the way, a critical industry. It's just that it's not handled within our standard definition. There is criticality around automotive repair. But it's automotive repair, oil and gas, aviation, in some cases, the military -- foreign military and power generation. So it's broadly based.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And you had a lot of new product releases around the diagnostics. Those products are typically smaller. Are you generating similar margins to the -- to what your traditional diagnostic product line?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, yes. I don't think -- look, I think the products we mentioned, which are handheld diagnostics and for heavy truck and for automotive, there isn't much margin difference between those 2 segments, I would say. So if you're talking about like products reaching into different segments like diagnostics or software, they're pretty much the same types of margins. The margin variation in the RS&I Group comes from the sort of essential tool businesses that we sell to OEM dealerships, that can be a little smaller, and the undercar equipment businesses, which can -- are hardware-based and tend to attract lower margins than, say, the software businesses. But in general, there's no implied motion period-to-period, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year by those. That we have talked about today.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Nick, you were asked earlier about the sequestration on military and the government shutdown on military. I guess, I wanted to approach that question a little bit differently and just see if you saw any slowdown in channel velocity through your franchisees in the second half of September.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, we usually don't comment on month by month, but I will offer this. When I go out -- and like I said, I was just on a van up in upstate New York, I was just with the national franchise conference -- our franchise advisory council last weekend. And as -- they represent -- there's franchisees, there's 12 of them, they represent every region of our country. I saw nothing but optimism. So my suggestion about the effects of this uncertainty broadly described around the shutdown and the debt ceiling and the sequestration, I believe is not weighing as heavily on smaller businesses that we're seeing, that are -- remember, we're operating in criticality. So the small businesses operating in criticality, whether you're talking about technicians or franchisees or repair shop owners, they seem to be anesthetized to the bad news. As I move up in size the businesses, they seem to be more burdened by the uncertainty. The bigger businesses, the more uncertain they are. And then, of course, anybody who's dealing directly with the business, like our military business, of course, that business gets shut down a little bit. So that's what we're seeing. If you talk about the effects of sequestration and the shutdown of the government and the debt ceiling and the whole idea that this is going to come up again in February and all this news, sure, this is something we watch, but we are not wringing our hands over it.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. You were asked earlier as well about the emerging markets. I just want to go back and pick up on that. If you could just talk about the profitability of the emerging markets business and how's that changing.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "The emerging -- look, if you look at -- it's a -- the emerging market business is about as profitable as the rest of the businesses. Let's say, in C&I, emerging market is a big piece of our business -- a big piece of our emerging market business in C&I. It's about as profitable as that business. It's about as profitable as the businesses reflected in the segment for those product lines. The geography of the profitability is different, lower gross margin, lower SG&A or lower operating expense usually. And then we can parse that there's a pre-investment on top of it that tends to put a little bit of drag on it, and that investment keeps going as we keep expanding. But if you look at the business as it occurs transaction by transaction, you say, this is just as profitable as all the rest of our businesses. So we're very encouraged by that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. On Europe, can you -- on Europe, you've -- I think you've talked in the past, it's roughly about 1/3 of that C&I segment, right?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Say that again, I didn't quite catch it.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I'm sorry. The European business, we think of that as being...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "About 1/3, yes.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "About 1/3 of the C&I business. So I guess, the question is, it sounds like it's stabilizing, that's encouraging. When that business comes back and you get a little further down the road, you're running at close to full capacity, what can the European business generate in terms of margins? What would you think of as peak margin capability for that business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, actually, I don't think we've ever spoken to the margins of the European business in isolation. But certainly, you will be entitled to the fact that we know these -- we've said these things. The European business was down drastically. It was wounded. We have pushed on it and pulled on it and worked RCI on it over the years. Remember, it really never -- it came out of the recession briefly in 2010, then sort of dipped back in, at the end of 2011, went back to double digit reductions and kept going. But through that period, we were working RCI, but we were very careful to, say, one, we didn't see our customers disappear; two, we didn't actually take out capacity. We kept capacity there because we're confident the business comes back, and what that means is we have lowered breakeven. And I would suggest to you that the idea that it is more profitable on even lower sales is good arithmetic and quantitative testimony to the fact that works pretty well. When volume comes back and they start to see some good numbers, it will accrue relatively well to the bottom line like any of our businesses, I believe. And what's happening in Europe actually is kind of interesting. Northern Europe has come back. We're -- particularly England, double digit growth for our businesses overall in England. Very good in the north, Sweden, Norway up very well. The middle countries like Germany and France, France still down, but narrowed a little bit. And then the periphery contributing, like the Maghreb countries and Turkey and so on contributing well. So you still see that Europe is not yet cured, but it's stabilizing in the middle, and the north actually seems to -- at least in this quarter, seems to have turned a little bit of a corner. That accrues well for us based on where our cost structure is.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So what you're saying is, essentially because of the lower breakeven, you think, as volume comes back, your margins will recover faster there than they would elsewhere in the business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think you'd be in -- I think you'd be entitled to that assertion, yes -- to that thought, yes.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That's good. Last question. Just you talked about the OEM dealerships being a bigger part of your business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of business trends there? Are the OEM dealerships likely to be a stronger part of your business going forward? And what are the implications for your RS&I mix?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, actually, I -- correct me -- let me come back. The OEM dealerships, our business with the OEM dealerships, electronic parts catalogs and this essential tools business were up -- I think I said were up strongly in the quarter. But our sales to independents -- Mitchell 1, the software business, the diagnostics business, these are software-based businesses that take advantage of our reservoir of data about the independent -- the car part that independents need so badly, those were up strong double digits. And so actually, I wouldn't say our business is changing. It was growing in the OEMs, but it also grew in the independents. So I wouldn't say the mix changed this quarter, just both moved for us.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no other questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Great, thanks. We'll wrap up our call today. A replay of it will be available on snapon.com shortly.

Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski,Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Cameron, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier today.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning and with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next the audio icon for the call. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now like to call -- turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. Look, I'll start by covering the highlights of our fourth quarter and of our year. I'll give you our perspective on the results, on our markets and the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "Our fourth quarter is a story of reaching new customers, energizing existing customers with innovative products and creating value by operating more effectively -- more productivity, I believe is strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runway through both growth and for improvement.", "Our EPS in the quarter was $1.60, up from $1.43 in 2012. That rise reflects an opco operating margin of 15.5%, an increase of 70 basis points. It also includes $33 million of financial service earnings. Taken together, the consolidated operating margin reached 18.5%, compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "The operating improvement came on organic sales growth of 4.6%. When you add in $15.2 million, the contribution from Challenger Lifts, which, you'll recall, we acquired earlier in 2013, overall sales in the quarter were $797.5 million, a rise of 5.9%, which overcame a 70-basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency translation. That activity represents the continuation of a generally favorable environment for the Tools Group and for the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. These are the operations serving our automotive repair and related customers, and as you may remember, that sector has been leaning favorably, for quite some time.", "Encouragingly though, in the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I group, we saw additional confirmation of easing in our European headwinds.", "I think it's fair to say that the growth at our European-based hand tools business, SNA Europe, up in the high-single-digit range is the biggest highlight for us in the quarter, with respect to market dynamic, anyway.", "Now, one quarter of growth doesn't make a trend. And that region's been down and unpredictable for an extended period. But this quarter's increase was a breath of fresh air.", "On the other hand, military activity did remain a strong headwind. Nothing's really changed on that front. The combination of troop withdrawals and budgetary restrictions continue to create a difficult environment and it doesn't show signs of rebounding anytime soon.", "So to wrap up the broad discussion on markets, other than the initial spark in Europe, I'd summarize things as relatively similar to past quarters. But we do believe that no matter the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We continue to progress along our 4 defined runways for growth: enhancing the franchise channel; expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage; extending into critical industries; and building on emerging markets. And when coupled with the Snap-on value creation of processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, we achieved decisive progress. And we believe the results, over the past several years, and again, in 2013, showed just that. That progress can be seen -- and that progress can be seen in the full year absolute, as well as the longer term trend of improvement.", "Speaking of full year, Snap-on's EPS for 2013 was $5.93, an increase of 14% from 2012. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 15.1%, up 120 basis points for the year. When we include the income from our financial services, which was $125.7 million, which rose $19 million from 2012, the consolidated operating margin of 18.1% was up 140 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.1 billion, a 4% year-over-year increase that was made up of 3.5% organic growth, $39.3 million in sales from Challenger Lifts and 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.", "Through the year, gains in the Tools Group and RS&I were somewhat offset by the external headwinds that primarily impacted the C&I group. Although it is worth mentioning that the second half organic sales increase was 4.7%, as the European headwind abated. So there was a generally improving trend as the year progressed. So that's the overview of the quarter and the year.", "Now, let's move to a discussion of the individual segments. In the C&I group, organic sales were up 3.8%, in spite of the continuing military challenges. That gain was authored by the improvement at SNA Europe, which I already mentioned, as well as favorable comparisons across the balance of the operations in our Asia-Pacific business, in the critical industries outside of the military and with our power tools, driven by innovative new products.", "From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $37.1 million increased $5.2 million, compared to the prior period. That represents a margin rate of 13.1% or an expansion of 150 basis points. The benefits from RCI are evident across the C&I businesses. And this quarter, with volume growth at SNA Europe, the improved cost structure in that operation really shined through. C&I is where we have the most attention-related -- and in C&I is where we had the most attention related to building in emerging markets, and extending into the critical industries. Our progress along those runways and the benefits from Snap-on value creation could be seen once again this quarter. You can see it in our results.", "For emerging markets, China and Indonesia led the way, with that growth being in enabled, in part, by our newest plant, ramping up production of undercar equipment for China and the region. But our focus isn't just in Asia, we also saw a good expansion in other emerging regions. For example, SNA Europe's business in Turkey recorded another encouraging quarter in that important market.", "Another highlight was our natural resources business, which is up strongly in the quarter. We continue to broaden our lineup for industries like oil and gas, and it's paying off. I'll give you a prime example of how it works. Our customer connection and innovation processes came together to make work easier for oil and gas professionals, supporting our extension into that critical industry. The result is our new adjustable wrench and valve persuaders, aimed specifically at those technicians providing a safe -- and providing a safe alternatives to the homemade versions that our salesmen noticed in many of the toolboxes at the north slope of Alaska, came right out of direct observation in Alaska. Taking input directly from those operators, we combined the wide mouth, heavy duty adjustable wrench, with the persuader at opposite ends of the tool, that enables the opening and closing of nearly every valve in an oil field. It's now outfitting facilities across the globe, building Snap-on's presence.", "Now that product, this product is just one. Relatively small example, but an easy one to understand, and it demonstrates our ever-increasing line up of tools, not only for oil fields, but for places like deepwater drilling and for industry power plants, all places where we're gaining traction. And more and more, our array of tools are being put together in specialized toolkits, in unique tool control units, equipped with top-of-the-line technology, to serve critical industries.", "Speaking of technology and of tool control, this is an area that's really opened the doors for our extension into the critical aviation sector, which is up nicely, again, in 2013.", "Our advanced tool control units, they continue to be a great halo product in that arena. And when paired with our customized toolkits, these unique solutions are at the foundation of our growth in aviation. Snap-on's now able to better support maintenance facilities, or production lines, for airplanes or helicopters, in all fleets, commercial or corporate, across the U.S. and internationally.", "Also speaking to innovation, with applications across a whole host of tasks, in 2013, we launched, what we believe to be, the best combination of power and speed in an industrial grade cordless ratchet. It's built with the same well-known Snap-on strength standards as our hand tool ratchets and features over 3,000 inch pounds of manual torque capability. And it has a digital variable speed trigger, for the precise control needed in industrial application, and a built-in brake that stops the tools from damaging sockets and fasteners. This new product's a big hit. And it demonstrates the clear Snap-on advantage.", "One final point on innovation in C&I, and this is at SNA Europe. The Bahco ERGO Tool Management System recently won an award for innovation at the EQUIP AUTO show in Paris. This product, aided by web design interfaces, for the customer and the salesperson, allows nearly infinite customization. And it's not only the toolkit that can be specified -- it's not only the toolkit that can be specified for oil and gas or aviation or heavy duty applications, it's also the foam inlays and the drawer configurations, providing unique and efficient placement for the tools, and specially designed spaces for PCs and tablets and printers that are now so frequently used in the modern field. The Innovation Award was encouraging, but more importantly, this product helped drive SNA Europe's growth this quarter. It's been -- and it's been especially well received in critical applications like oil and gas, where expanding tool offering, customization and standardization are really highly valued.", "Now onto the Tools Group, where we posted a strong 10.2% year-over-year organic sales increase this quarter, with good growth in all geographies. The operating earnings of $51 million represented a margin rate of 14.5%, up 30 basis points from 2012.", "Some years ago, we set a goal of enhancing the franchise channel. In that regard, the results in the Tools Group continue to speak for themselves. And I believe the state of that business is stronger than ever. Once again -- and once again, this year, there was outside validation of that belief. Snap-on continues to be consistently ranked in the top 25 of all networks by Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction. And we moved up again in Entrepreneur Magazine's Top 500 franchise list.", "More importantly, I think, really, the internal evidence supports the same positive view. The franchisee metrics we monitor so closely are quite strong and they continued to trend favorably. Our direct interaction with the franchisees, the 2014 kick-off event that just took place, the meetings of our Franchisee Advisory Council and our regular regional gatherings aimed at getting feedback and enhancing productivity, all of them confirmed the growing strength of our network emphatically, and it makes sense.", "We have major sales and marketing initiatives like the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express and the new Techno-Van, they continue to expand, driving excitement and sales. Those traveling shows generate strong demand for our big ticket tool storage and handheld diagnostics, they're all up. But it's not just these big hitter marketing programs that are enabling improvement, it's also the everyday focus, customer connection and innovation, creating new product after new product, that builds our position. For example, in 2013, we introduced an all-new 36-long 1/2\" breaker bar, our longest ever. With this new tool, technician not only have extended reach and access, but they can also apply more torque with less effort, it makes the work easier as they break free the most difficult of fasteners.", "The product has a wide range of applications, but it's especially powerful in the critical heavy duty segment, where it's particularly effective on truck engine heads and bulldozer track bolts. This is just another one of the offerings that will make our hit parade list. Those are the new products that sell more than $1 million in the first year. It's a good example. It sounds simple, but innovation doesn't need to be earth shattering, it just needs to make work easier and the opportunities in that regard keep continuing.", "And of course, Snap-on's uniquely positioned, actually, to gain customer connection insight with our franchisee network and our teams of salespeople visiting sites, observing work, bringing back ideas. During 2013, the Tools Group alone launched more than 40 new products that were directly based on our feedback from professional users and our franchisees.", "For example, we recently developed the new thin-walled socket, specifically designed to remove difficult fuel pressure sensors on many new vehicles. The product concept came to us from a franchisee. He noticed that the access to the sensors were often -- was often restricted and that technicians risk damage when they use standard tools. So our new thin-walled socket will fix all that. It's another good example of customer connection, a knowledge of the practical and technical design capabilities, innovation and understanding the possible, coming together to create a winning product.", "I'll just mention one last item, on customer catching for the Tools Group. We're recently recognized in Tech Shop Magazine, named as the 2013 Top 5 tools award winner. This award's noteworthy because it is determined directly by professional users as they name their favorite tools. I believe the award speaks clearly to the continuing appreciation and aspiration that serious professionals hold for Snap-on and its products.", "Let's move onto our RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $246.6 million, and for the first time surpassed $1 billion for the year. The fourth quarter organic gain was 2.9%. Now, that's somewhat less than the past few quarters, primarily reflecting the wind down of a large OEM essential diagnostic distribution rather than any real change in the overall macros. Adding $15.2 million from Challenger Lifts and 30 basis points for foreign exchange -- for favorable foreign exchange, RS&I reported quarterly sales of 9.5% -- sorry, RS&I reported quarterly sales that were up 9.5% from 2012.", "Operating earnings of $60.8 million in the quarter were up $5.4 million, with the OI margin of 23%, up slightly from 22.9%. As the benefits of RCI more than overcame about 90-basis point impact from adding the lower margin Challenger business.", "I've spoke often in the past about our string of new handheld diagnostics introduced over the quarters and years, and they continue to drive growth in the independent repair space. With our most recent launch, the MODIS Ultra unit, bigger screen, more features, faster operation. It was launched in the third quarter and it's been a tremendous hit.", "We're also adding to the content embedded in our Mitchell 1 repair information. Just recently, again, acting on feedback from customers, we introduced enhanced search functionality in our ProDemand product. It's called 1Search. It allows the user to simultaneously search both the standard OEM repair information and our special SureTrack expert shortcuts, a clear efficiency driver and a differentiator for the Mitchell offering.", "Just a little more on SureTrack. It represents a consolidation of our proprietary, experience-based information from professional technicians, who are performing millions of successful field fixes. It frequently shows the way to faster diagnosis than is possible by following the standard OEM protocols. We believe that the ProDemand structure for Mitchell, reflecting substantial input from users, is the most effective in the industry, combining powerful and comprehensive OEM repair information with practical shop experience.

With our essential diagnostics for OEMs, repair information and TruckLabor estimating from Mitchell 1, and the next line of handheld diagnostics units, we're expanding our presence with truck shop owners and managers, supporting fleets, dealers and repair garages.", "We continue that expansion this past quarter as Challenger Lifts launched a new mobile column lift, specifically aimed at heavy duty shops. It has a capacity of up to 144,000 pounds and provides flexibility and convenience to lift large vehicles without requiring a permanent dedicated footprint in the service bay.

Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. It was an encouraging quarter to end the year. Significant progress was achieved throughout 2013 in the face of meaningful headwinds. Reduced military spending was a substantial factor on our fourth quarter and other quarters were impacted, to varying degrees, by the military decline, as well as by the weakness in Europe.", "With that said, we're reassured by the advancements being made along each of our runways for growth. Critical industries like aviation, national resources and heavy fleets posted good gains and we're gaining further traction. Our new undercar plant in China came to life providing a broader range of new products of service facilities, both in OEM dealerships, as well as the developing independent repair industry in that region. And outside of Asia, we're building presence in other emerging markets, such as Brazil, where this year, we launched our first handheld diagnostic unit for automotive technicians.", "The Tools Group continues to gain position with expanding sales of favorable franchisee metrics speaking to the improvement. RS&I made progress, serving shop owners and managers with new handhelds enhanced repair information, increasing heavy duty capabilities and with an expanded undercar equipment portfolio that now includes Challenger Lifts. At the same time, the Snap-on value creation framework which drove much of our improvement over the past few years contributed again, resulting in strong margin increases. And in the end, resulting in these strong margin increases we registered during the fourth quarter and throughout the year.", "But as we move through 2014, we remain confident in our strategies and encouraged by our runways. The balance of driving growth and creating improvement has authored our trajectory of positive results, achieved, regardless of headwinds. We will maintain that balance. We will take full advantage of the abundant opportunities before us, and we believe we will continue the trend of encouraging performance in the quarters and years ahead.", "Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll turn my attention to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. The encouraging results would not have been possible without your unique capabilities, considerable energy and continuing commitment to our team. For the extraordinary part you played in achieving this performance, you have my congratulations and you have my thanks.", "Operator, now we'll take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Nick, you mentioned in the Tools Group, I believe, you did 40 new products this year? Is that correct or was that..", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. What I said was 40 new products came directly and clearly out of field suggestions from franchisees and our field sales personnel in other words, we can clearly trace them to customer connection. We did more new products that bubble up in imprecise ways through information we have in the organization or ideas that are developed in the engineering labs here. So the 40, were really -- they were the new products we could clearly identify that came out of the north slope in Alaska. And or the garage in Sacramento.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So is it a safe assumption to say that you've more than hit your target of 40 new products that generate over $1 million in sales?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. We did much more than that. It was more -- I'm not saying that the Tools Group -- I don't want to get into the numbers, but what we've said is, is that -- I think, regularly, I told you and others in these kinds of conversations that how we measure the effectiveness of our new products are measuring what's on that hit parade. Those products which sell over $1 million in the first year. And last year, we achieved several times what we did just a few years ago, say, 2006, 2005, and we're up a nice number over last year's number so we see progress in that regard. We're pretty encouraged by that access of customer connection and innovation, the art of the practical understanding of the garage, matched with the understanding of the -- what's possible based on technology coming up with a new product. We had a number of great hits this year.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then you mentioned some pretty good growth in your emerging markets. I mean, given what's going on in some of these emerging markets due to currencies or whatever, are there any cause for concerns there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'm not concerned. But I think, look, it isn't easy. There -- I think we said back second quarter you can see lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter in the emerging markets, but we believe strongly in our physicals -- growing our physicals. Now, for example, our resellers are up more than 10%, our training -- number of training units in emerging market, there's training sessions in emerging markets up more than 10%. Our new factories there, our products in the mid-tier are growing. And when we look at the marketplace, what we see is 3 effects. You got the macros. So the macro occurs and the economy is up and down. Some of it, for example, in China, it's driven by exports. So they were exporting to Europe, a lot of those factories shutdown. So that's the kind of macro that affects people and it affects us in some ways, too. Although -- you had that but you also have, for us, the idea -- the repair wave rising on top of that and then you have the fact that we're just getting started in those markets. So it's kind of a complex milieu that drives our business. We don't have concerns about the future though, we were up nicely in China in this quarter and India had a good year. Indonesia was up and we -- that has been up and down for us. So this quarter, Indonesia led the way. So we're pretty pleased and encouraged by where we're going in emerging markets.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And 2 other quick ones. First of all, you've often said that the tool -- the portfolio on the financial service will mimic the growth in the Tools Group. This quarter, it certainly -- the originations certainly outgrew what your segment sales growth was in Tools. So can you maybe comment on that delta?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Yes. This is Aldo, Gary. Certainly, it was a strong quarter and it was up more than what we saw last year moving from Q3 to Q4. But 19%, I think, is in the bounds of reasonableness. If you look at the Tools Group, their overall growth was up 10.2%, a little bit more in the U.S. than the average. And within that group, their sale of big-ticket items, including tool storage and diagnostics, was above that average as well. So while it certainly was a good quarter in financial services and people took advantage of the financing packages that we had available, I think the originations were reflective of the fact that it was good big-ticket performance in Q4.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, lastly, and I'm not asking for a specific number, Nick, but do you think given that you've hit that operating margin goal that you set a couple of years ago, you've actually exceeded it, that some time this year you'll be able to reset that for the investment community?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, like you said, we set that target a long time ago. I think in 2005 or 2006, we were down around 5.9% and we've been talking about it often. This year -- for the full year, we're up 15.1%, 15.5% in the quarter. I'll simply say this: we believe strongly in our runways for growth and improvement and our capability to take advantage of this. We believe that we can continue to improve on a regular basis. I'm not saying every quarter, although if you look back we've been doing it every quarter, I'm not saying everything has to happen every quarter like clockwork, but we feel pretty strongly that we can continue to improve over -- in a trend, continue to improve in sales and in profitability. We got topped out in margin. And as far as the endpoints, we sit, we are armed with a great franchise. So we think this franchise is among the best. So we don't see any end to the improvement in our -- and looking out into the future.", "Operator", "Then we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you just talk about -- you talked about, during your prepared remarks aboutfranchise productivity and about growing productivity. I was just wondering if you could maybe go back to that and elaborate a little further and just give us a sense of how much further opportunity you think might be there? Is it being driven by new products? Is it the diagnostics and storage? Just help us understand what's behind your expectations for upside and for the productivity?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, look, I think -- the thing is, is that, the Tools Group has been performing quite in an encouraging manner. We have said that we will grow organically at 4% to 6%. We have said the Tools Group, by the nature of this business, is probably over the long haul in the sort of lower end of that number, but it grew 10.2% this fourth quarter. Last year, in the fourth quarter, it grew 9.3%. 9.3% and that was in 2012. In 2011, it grew 9.3%. And the year before that, it grew 12.8%. So it's been hammering away at some great quarters and that management team has understood the resonances of this business. And part and parcel of the residence is to recognize that the van is bounded -- the van is bounded based on space, and the driver is bounded based on time. And what the Tools Group is doing is work -- in terms of the productivity side, they're working on ways to break through those boundaries. That's why we have the Techno -- we have the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express which adds space in effect, virtual space. They are temporary time-sharing space to the vans and it's driven some of our big-ticket tool storage business. We're up over 60 of those now in North America. And we added about 6 or 7 in this past quarter, about 10%. And the Techno-Vans which basically focuses on diagnostics breaking -- relieving the van driver of having to understand the diagnostics as deeply as he might. In fact, I just rode on a Techno-Van just recently down here in Illinois with a young franchisee, Miguel Ortiz, and Mike Bedell, the driver, and they want around and you want to see how this works. They go to these shops and 3 technicians get on and they demonstrate the efficacy of the individual tools, the big diagnostics and the small ones, and even the tool storage stations where a shop owner can -- a lead tech can look at this tool storage station and say, \"Gee. I can explain to my customer in a 16 by 7 flatscreen what's on the diagnostic, and I can store all my tools in it.\" And he pops for a bigger ticket item around diagnostics. He understands the real value and the full capability of diagnostics and that's part of what's behind us selling. But at the core of it is, breaking through the franchisees' time constraints. And so what the Tools Group is doing is looking at doing that. And so what you're seeing in the Tools Group is selling to more customers because they're breaking -- they're given the -- they're freeing up more time for the franchisee. Miguel Ortiz told me that, the guy I was -- the franchisee told me, \"I ride-by shops because I can't -- I don't have time to call on them.\" This helps him to get more time to sell. And then the other thing we're doing with the tools -- with the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and with the new products and innovation and customer connection is we're giving them more to sell to excite existing customers. So when we rollout these thin wall sockets and so on, they excite the existing customers. I can't parse between those 2, but I can tell you that the Tools Group seems to be understanding that very well. Now, are they going to hit double digits every time? I don't think so. But we're cheering them on because they've been doing it.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So in 2014, you're going to comp the Techno-Vans, and you're going to anniversary the contribution. And again, I appreciate the fact that you're still growing the size of that fleet. I guess the question is, do you continue to grow that fleet and that drives growth through 2014? Or do you do something like...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I don't know. A year ago we had -- now we have -- if you combined the vans, if you combine the Techno-Vans with the Rock 'N Roll Cabs, we have about 70 now, we have about half that number 1 year ago. So I would say that we've been growing quite a bit so I don't know if we're going to keep growing. I guess I would expect we won't grow that many more Rock 'N Roll Cabs, which are the bigger number. I think we have almost, say, like 50 of those now -- 50 or 60 of those now but we'll add them as long as they're adding incrementally to us. And they have so far. It probably will slow down but then we'll be adding Techno-Vans. Where that stops, I don't know. Where that stops, I'm not sure.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, well the growth is encouraging. Just a couple of other quick questions. On the operating expenses, I guess, from the operating comp, you're up to about $1 billion now. How leverageable are these from here? In other words, I guess, how do you -- how does that number grow going forward with respect to revenue growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "You mean the operating expenses? Say that again please, sorry.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just your operating expense. I'm just wondering how leverageable those are. So, I guess, the question is, how did those grow going forward with respect to growth in revenue?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I can't give you guidance, but I'll tell you this, I think we're giving the Tools Group a blank check when they're growing at 10% or 9%. So I think they're out capturing territories. So if you look at their operating expenses, they're out there. Now, blank check maybe a little bit of an overstatement, but we're encouraging them to invest in things like product development, like the vans and so on. So if you're looking at the Tools Group and you're looking at this incandescent, this great growth, you're probably not going to see as much leverage on operating expenses until they sort of level of and then we know how to make money on top of that and be more efficient behind that growth weight. The other businesses, I think if you look at C&I, C&I has shown some great leverage in that area. In fact, C&I was up, what, 130 basis points in the quarter? And that was against that 70 basis points of unfavorable currency transaction. There are 150 basis points and that was again 70 basis points of unfavorable currency transaction -- or not 70 basis points, 120 basis points of currency transaction bad news. So they're seeing great leverage. So it's sort of a tale of 2 views of that. In Tools Group, you're not seeing much leverage because we're spending and we're rolling as fast as we can to capture territory. In C&I, we're getting a little bit of -- a little bit more leverage because we're seeing the headwinds and we're paying attention to -- a little bit more to efficiency.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. Last question is just the January here, could you just talk about the impact of weather disruptions on the business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, yes, I mean -- but it's kind of mixed. Of course, if you have something happen like Atlanta, it's going to cause you some problems and you're going to lose business. If you have continuing cold weather just as a kind of -- just regular cold weather like we're seeing here in Chicago, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, 0 degrees, sometimes it actually can accelerate business after a while because you get more difficulties. People will ruin transmissions and some of the heavy trucks will ruin transmissions trying to plow in the snow. You'll see people have difficulties in starting their cars and so on, and you have collision, which will drive more business. So I think the story here is the jury's out on this. It might affect you in a certain period because of items like Atlanta or storms in the northeast or so on, but then you have to wait and see in our business whether it's going to generate much more business based on the negative effects of that on the cars and so on. So for us, I don't really have a good answer on that. We're sort of like in a wait and see situation. I can't say whether it's definitely be good or definitely be bad.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Let's start with Snap-on Europe Tools. Nice to see an increase on there. Now that -- I guess we can pretty firmly say we put a bottom in, in that business. Can you give us some perspective?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I said there was a bottom.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "No, no. How far is below 2007, 2008 levels?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "How far below 2007 and 2008 levels are we today? Is that what you're...", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. Where did it bottom off?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know, I can't -- I don't really have an answer for that. I can't really say that. I just know we're pretty far", "[Audio Gap]", "Certainly in Southern Europe, it's come down substantially. I really don't have an answer for you on that.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Do you think it's down more than a 1/3?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No, I don't -- I'd say 1/4 may be, something like that.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Yes. 20%, 25%.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'd say 1/4, probably. You can think about this as -- I think -- I'm trying to remember, but I think we entered the recession with about -- Europe being about 1/4 of our business and now, it's like 1/5 or something like that. So that's the kind of number, but that's our overall European business. Outside [ph] of Europe, maybe down slightly more than that.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Outside of there. Okay. And then as we look in the improvement that you're seeing, is that broad-based across the continent? Or is it -- are there certain pockets that you're seeing?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, there's landscapes to that. I mean, I think -- look, actually, interestingly, Southern Europe was up higher than the average but it was off of kind of dog food base. And so it was up in this period substantially, northern Europe, including the U.K. and some of those broad countries, while some of that was mixed, the U.K. was very strong and other countries were up. And so that was up very strong. The middle of Europe, which I would say, like, Germany and so on, that was sort of smaller than the average growth and then interestingly, our Eastern European business, which in this particular period -- and it can be lumpy, our Eastern European business was actually a little disappointing. It was a little flat and maybe down a little bit in certain countries but that was because it's mostly bigger ticket items. And so I think that can be a little variation. If you look at the other periphery, which I would say, the Middle East, and I mentioned Turkey, the MAGRA countries, Northern Africa, they were up strongly. So you have that kind of mix throughout Europe. I mean the net of it is, I think, that the U.K. continued to shine through and was probably better than it was, and north was better than it was. The south was better than it was. The center came back to more an even keel. Your eastern Europe might backed off a little bit and the periphery stayed strong.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then in the emerging markets, China, Southeast Asia area, as you're growing out your physicals there and you try and grow your distribution foreign partners and things like that, how -- what are you running into from the competition in the space? [indiscernible] you're doing?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I -- we -- sure, we see people trying to copy our products. People try to come in and copy our products and match our products. It's not so much for -- I don't know if it so much in a distribution area, it's more in the product area where people try to mimic what we're doing. And remember, it's a quite a fragmented market. So we'll see an effect maybe in, let's say, Chongqing, you'll see a local competitor try to step up and try to emulate what we do but we have to deal with that there and we do. And so I would say that's the #1 effect. We do try -- I think the major thing I can say about emerging markets is simply it's early, early, early days. It is over 10% of our business now but we expect it to be more because we can see ourselves riding up on the wave. And yes, we'll see competitors, people will try to match our products or copy our product and maybe they'll try to compete with us with resellers although we haven't seen that so far. But we're pretty confident in our model, in our technology, our products and the building of our physicals to prevail over time.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 last things here. If we look at some of these companies that make automotive parts, aftermarket parts and sell them into the market, whether it's shock absorbers or batteries or what have you, tires, they've seen in the last quarter or 2 an acceleration in their revenues selling it to the market which would imply that the frequency of the repair, maybe the magnitude of the repair is starting to increase. Are you sensing anything like that, that's going on in the market?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, no, but I'll say that our business has -- I read to you what the Tools Group's numbers were over 4 years for 4 quarters, so we may have been seeing something like that for some time. I have the sense though that we are getting stronger relative to our competition in that mobile tool space. I do -- when I talked to -- so I see yourselves having gotten out of the box, giving us an advantage after the recession. Having found -- our Tools Group having found the residences in the distribution model with product and productivity to expand helping us, I guess, make progress versus -- in the marketplace. But also when I talk to our customers -- when our customers -- I talk -- I was just out on events, talking to transmission shops and regular shops, they all say their business is pretty good. They don't say things like well -- occasionally, I hear somebody say, \"It's never been better.\" But it's not uniform. It does say though, \"I'm feeling good. I think I have a good business. I need to figure out how to expand, to handle more business.\" So maybe you do see some increase. Maybe you do see some increase. But I don't think it's been more this quarter than, say, last quarter.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then the last item here, obviously, you have an opportunity here at the European tool business from a cyclical recovery perspective, what else in the business model right now would be opportunity for upside to get back to normal-type demand? And my guess is most everything is there, is back there already. Is there...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes. I mean, I think -- well, look, I think, to get back to normal demand, we keep expanding our product line. I think the great example of that is the Bahco Ergo tool storage system -- Tool Control System. New product opening up a whole set of the whole different selling activity that works for us in Europe. That does help us. So as the European market comes back, we've been sharpening our skills in Europe to be able to take even more advantage than we had when the market was last up in 2007. The other piece of this is, I mean, I would say, we've been dealing with a pretty significant headwind in the military. Brutal. I mean, the military's just been going down and down and down. And so I think eventually, that, even though I said on the call, I don't see the end of that, eventually that comes back and we feel confident about our position because we're still getting contracts. The problem is, they say, \"Congratulations. You got the contract. But the bad news is we don't actually have any money to fund it.\" And so you'll have to wait to actually get orders on this contract. So, I think that the military would accrue very well to us. And you got to remember that in the quarter, and we don't want to -- we don't make a big thing about this because we think it's just noise for us, but currencies didn't exactly treat us that well in this quarter. 70 basis points -- I think it was 70 basis points on sales for a translation and another 70 basis points on profits for transaction. And eventually, currencies all even -- I always feel currencies always even out, so I think that comes back after a while, or you adjust for it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Nick, you talked about Europe rebounding nicely and you sort of actually went around all the regions and how they were doing, but you did talk about the European auto show and how much lift and you had some new product acceptance there. How much is that auto show helped lift sales either in this quarter or going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I think it is a factor but it's not a huge factor. Our auto business is one of the pieces in Europe so I wouldn't tie it completely to the auto sector. Although we have -- as the auto sector what -- I think the European sales are supposed to be up a couple percent next year, maybe 2.5% or something like that. I don't know if that's going to drive us. We certainly have an opportunity to get bigger in auto, and the fact that we got the award in auto will give us the opportunity. In the quarter, I wouldn't say it was the main effect but it does represent an opportunity for us. And if we win, as we did in Innovation Award, at that auto show, it bodes well for our future.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Aldo, you had another nice step up in free cash flow even as you pointed out the 19% increase in the finance receivables. You've called out the fact that you're going to pay down $100 million in debt. It seems your cash flow is going to continue to increase. How do you prioritize the use beyond the -- what you had discussed in the payback of $100 million?", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Well, first and foremost, of course, is to support the organic growth. Again, we're a fairly working capital intensive company. So I would always remind people that as revenues grow, we invest 25%, 26% of revenue growth goes into working capital. Snap-on credit was actually one of the larger users of cash, of course, if you look back over the year on what the growth of that portfolio. And while I don't expect it to grow at the same rate of $148 million, it's still will be a user of cash as we look at 2014. CapEx, pretty much equal to dividend -- I mean, not dividend -- depreciation and amortization, so up a little bit. Share repurchases, we're not insignificant. I mean $83 million in the course. Of course, our strategy is to offset dilution. And of course, we are opportunistic as we look at acquisitions. This past year, we spent $38.2 million on Challenger. I think it was in Nick's comment that it's very close to our DNA. And as a result of that, we're leveraging that acquisition in a variety of ways. We continue to look for opportunities like that so I'm going ahead, that's what we have our radar screen open to.", "Operator", "Then we'll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar Financial Services.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about just some big picture items here. Competition. I was curious how -- what's the competitive landscape at this point? Are competitors growing their van pool? Are you seeing new tool creation there similar to what you're doing? How does the competitive landscape look at this point?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, look, I think -- of course, if you talk about the mobile tool channel, we have 3 competitors: Mac, a sign of Stanley Black & Decker, Matco from Danaher, and Cornwell, an independent shop -- an independent operation with about 500 -- 400 or 500 vans. When I go out on these van rides and when I meet with franchisees at the -- things like kickoff meetings, NFAC, they really don't mention the competition particularly. Occasionally, you'll get a guy who mentioned that he has a particular friend who's riding a van but nothing in a competitive way -- riding a competitive van, nothing in a competitive way. Generally, our people reflect upon their own activity and say, \"I'm up year-over-year. I have a better product offering.\" or \"I'd like to see a little bit more.\" They don't talk so much about that so we don't really take action based on what the competitors are doing. So I'm not that well-informed. Although we try to make sure that we understand that they're constantly improving. And if we don't work hard in product and efficiency and so on, they'll be closing the GAAP with us. We understand that clearly but we haven't seen what I would say -- either in our numbers or in the anecdotal statements from our franchisees what I would call competitive pressure from those other franchises. Now I do know that Stanley Black & Decker, for example, has new products based on the Black & Decker line that they can sell through there vans. So they're replacing -- I'm sure they're placing some of the source product they had with their own manufactured product rolling through there, and that should give them some good sales increase for Stanley. But to the extent how that plays out in the marketplace, I'm not sure. We're not hearing much about it.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Do the competitors have the same kind of development that you're so good at where you have all of these different franchisees out there looking for opportunities with tools similar to what you described earlier in the call, where we witness the specialized tool come back, bring that back into the organization and say, \"This is what I saw, let's develop this.\" Or have you caught the competitors copying what you've done because these are, I would imagine, pretty unique tools?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, look, occasionally, you'll see similar tools in the marketplace that Snap-on has. But I think I know the Stanley people, they're smart people. I'm sure they're doing everything possible to try to create productivity and innovation and capability in their network. I couldn't comment really pretty much on any specifics in that regard because we don't really run into it in the marketplace. Our focus is looking at our own vans and saying, \"How can I reach our customers?\" Taking that guy I mentioned, Miguel Ortiz, a young franchisee, and get him time so he doesn't have to drive by those places on his route. He's got time to call them. He gets to call on more customers. Get new products out so they energize our existing customers so they can't live without some of our tools because it will make their work easier and make more money for them. That's our focus. It's not so much about the competitors because after all, Snap-on does have a fairly strong position in this marketplace in terms of vans, in terms of loyalty of customers, in terms of power of the brand.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And second big picture kind of item is, over the next couple of years here, we're going to see more of off lease vehicles coming into the U.S. carpark. And I was curious over time, have you seen, as the carpark has ebbed and flowed here for the last 10 years or so, do you notice a corresponding change in your revenues? And should we think of this as somewhat maybe of an incremental, couple of basis points to your revenue growth as the carpark expands?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know. That's one possibility. But in general, the carpark expanding, of course, would add to our revenues. As the carpark expands, it would add to our revenues. So if that occurs, that would be a positive tailwind. The big tailwinds for us are the change in the technology. As cars change and they come out with new cars and new cars coming to the parking -- the park that have different technologies, people need different elements and tools to deal with them. Secondly, the idea that the cars are getting older every year, big sale years and small sale years, cars have gotten older every year. Since 1980, this has happened, and so therefore, that creates more repair. And then the idea that the shift -- the idea that independent garages are becoming a more important component in terms of sales, and they need to be more upskilled and more sophisticated so therefore, they need more products. One of the reasons why our diagnostics and the diagnostic workstations are selling well. And this is a very big ticket item, which combines a tool storage unit with a diagnostic unit and a flatscreen, is because the independent shops want to ascribe and project the idea of capability and competence and that kind of product does it. So I think that's what I can say about that.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. Ms. Kratcoski, I'll turn the call back to you for any further remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Well, thanks for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available at snapon.com shortly.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", "", "", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated First Quarter Investor Call. Today's conference is being recorded. ", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.", "Leslie Kratcoski ", "Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning and with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of the call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "", "Nicholas Pinchuk ", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual I'll start today\u2019s call with the highlights of our quarter. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on our markets and on our progress. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "Our first quarter results were encouraging. They demonstrate clear progress along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our sales were up 6.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points and the earnings per share increased 15.7% to $1.62. The organic sales increase was 5%. ", "Challenger Lifts, which you'll recall, we acquired in the second quarter last year, added another 15.2 million which along with an 80 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates brought our total sales for the quarter to 787.5 million. ", "The EPS rise included an opco operating margin expansion to 15.5%, up from 14.5% in 2013. Financial services operating income increased to 34.4 million from last year\u2019s 30.5, driving the consolidated numbers to -- operating margin to 18.6%, also up 100 basis points. Both the operating margin and the total margin were up 100 basis points. ", "From a macroeconomic standpoint, our automotive repair related businesses, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, they\u2019ve enjoyed a reasonably favorable environment for quite some time. And I'd say there is no real change. Now RS&I overall organic activity was up only slightly. But that primarily reflects the wind down of a major OEM program rather than any real change in market dynamics. You\u2019ll also remember that C&I is where the majority of our headwinds have been concentrated. So that\u2019s an area where I think is worth more -- a more discussion is warranted.", "And as you can tell from the group's, 10.4% organic rise, there were encouraging gains backed by some evolution of the environment. In Europe, one of the big highlights of our fourth-quarter was the lessening of our headwinds. And in conjunction with that, the first upturn in sales we've seen in some time for our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe. ", "Encouragingly, our first quarter was up again. So that\u2019s a real positive. And SNA Europe is a solid contributor to C&I\u2019s current growth. But I would characterize the C&I performance this quarter less about market improvement and more about day-to-day business progression. For example, we did see some important advancement in our extension to critical industries. It\u2019s an area we've been focusing on, and it\u2019s paying off. ", "At the same time, we\u2019ve moved past the most difficult comparisons related to the reduced military spending and that's allowing the European contributions in critical industry gains to shine through, without as much year-over-year military offset to mask the progress. So many of our markets remain strong and the headwind of Europe is abating. But headwinds do remain. The current situation in Eastern Europe does create an overhang and that did have an impact on our businesses. ", "And while the military comparisons are not as challenging, the absolute spending in that sector remains depressed without any near-term indication of a return to past levels. But generally at the end of the day, there will always be headwinds. And we do believe that, no matter the market environment, we're well-positioned to continue advancing down our four defined runways for growth enhancing the franchise channel, extending into the critical industries, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage and building in emerging markets. ", "And along with that progress, that advancement, we believe that the Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI will extend our positive performance trend and continue to drive us down our ample runways for improvement.", "And as I speak of the segment results, I\u2019ll highlight some of the advancements in both growth and in net improvement. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales in the quarter were up organically by 10.4%, the operating margin reached 13.5%, up significantly from last year\u2019s 11.5%. Related to those sales, there were gains in each of the group\u2019s operating units and as I already mentioned, one of the real highlights was a second consecutive quarter of growth for SNA Europe. We\u2019re starting to see a trend in Europe and we also saw a double digit rise in our industrial division where we have our primary focus on the spending to critical industries. And in that area, we had some big wins particularly in aviation. Also noteworthy in Asia was solid growth in important markets like India and the Philippines, much of that was driven by our expanding undercar equipment line-up that was made possible by the further significant ramp up of the production at our Kunshan plant.", "The C&I quarter saw benefits both from higher sales and from RCI. You can see it in the rise of the OI margin, up 200 basis points. Regarding the margins, SNA Europe deserves mention. Even before the volume started coming back late last year, that operation was contributing some noticeable profitability increases and that improvement continued again this quarter now amplified by the aid of volume. ", "As for the industrial division and the robust growth in that business, the activity this quarter with customers and then critical aerospace sector clearly demonstrates traction. That area has been a primary focus of our extension into critical industries and the results are showing through with some large win. I said for quite some time that there is a bit of learning curve in understanding the customers in critical industries with the same level of insight we have with automotive technicians.", "Now we are making progress with customer connection spending time in the work places, launching innovative new products based on those observations, for example -- and for example we\u2019re participating side by side at customer sites in RCI events and in safety training, becoming more familiar with the work, with the challenges and with the needs of our customers. You see RCI and safety are often directly related to making the work easier and safer with the right tool, and that\u2019s our business.", "Speaking to the right tool, I want to highlight a couple of new products that demonstrate customer connection and innovation applied to (south) [ph] critical test. We recently launched a new design of cutters called the cushion throat cutter. They were designed specifically for use in aviation where aero tools or material commonly referred to as foreign object damage, they can cause big problems in an engine. While we took our standard power edge cutters but added a feature that catches wire other material that was cut -- that other material that gets cut preventing it from flying off and causing troubles. This is a good example of job insight offering new tools and building our presence. In this case in the critical aviation sector a simple idea based on customer connection that makes a great difference.", "Oil and gas another area of focus and we have an expanding offering for applications in the oilfields, in power plants and in offshore rigs. Our visits to those sites recently highlighted the field technicians' struggle with making valve adjustments on the natural gas engines that are prevalent in that environment. As a result of that observation, we developed our new pass through socket to solve that particular problem creating just the special geometry that ends the struggle, another clear example of customer connection and innovation coming together to make work easier in a critical application.", "So that\u2019s a bit of colour on the C&I progress. Now on to tools, the tools group. Sales were up 6% organically, operating margin up 14.3% compared to 14.4% last year, including in the quarter 50 basis points of unfavourable currency impacts from our operations in Canada and Australia. Our organic growth for the past four years of 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6%, certainly speaks to the improved position of the tools group. And the growth this quarter following on the heels of that kind of sustained trend demonstrates the success we\u2019ve had on this decisive runway for growth, enhancing the franchise channel.", "But the enhancement is not just about sales, we see the progress in many places in the metrics we track, in the low franchisee turnover, in the high enthusiasm, in the external validation by independent surveys of our franchisees, they all confirm substantial progress. Much of the strength we've seen could be tied to the great innovative new products that Snap-on has to offer when showing up every week at repair shops. Products like the MODIS Ultra handheld diagnostic unit, faster with a bigger full colour touch screen and our Fast-Track Expert information, it\u2019s launched last year in the U.S. it\u2019s been a big success and it\u2019s helping to drive big ticket volume.", "During this quarter, we brought the MODIS Ultra to the UK and to Australia, it\u2019s been well received in both markets and has contributed significantly to our international growth. Also speaking on new products and innovation, you might recall the S6810 Flip Socket, the MOTOR Magazine Top 20 award winning tool, we introduced last year. Sounds simple. A two sided socket, 8 millimeter and 10 millimeters on opposite sides, very common sizes on under body panel. ", "The new socket can be quickly flipped for convenience, and removing panels with only one tool. It\u2019s a real timesaver and as a consequence, a big success. We have taken that idea and expanded it to other common sizes, adding a 13 millimeter and 15 millimeter combo, and specifically for European mix a 9 millimeter and 11 millimeter combo. And for Asian model, a 12 millimeter and 14 millimeter combo were sold in a set to span a range of vehicles a technician is likely to see, and a design to be used what our Snap-on CT power tool series. That combination is now one of this year\u2019s hit. ", "When it comes to new product innovation, you think that there might not have been much opportunity in a product line like a ratchet. They\u2019ve been around a long time. But actually we've been growing in that category over an extended period based on customer connection, innovation and design capabilities. You see preferences differ greatly among technicians depending on the mix of vehicles they encounter and the pairs on which they focus. So we take an advantage of those varying needs by introducing multiple ratchet designs and features against the relatively standard offerings of our competitors. I\u2019ll mention one of those variations.", "Our quarter inch drive extended reach series, it incorporates an extra-long handle, we believe the longest quarter inch drive available anywhere. It reaches hard to access areas and allows a greater leverage. It also has a quick release mechanism for those who want speed and I am fortunate incorporates our Dual 80 technology for strength and durability, another hit product, innovation even in a fully established line like ratchet, finely related to the tools group and its growth. ", "I want to mention our financial services segment. Aldo will speak of that area in some detail, but I just want to highlight the strategic importance of financial services at Snap-on, and how important it's been to the advancement, especially in those big ticket categories of diagnostics and tools storage. Those products has helped blaze the trail enhancing our franchisees and Snap-on credit continues to be an essential and strategic player in that progress.", "Let\u2019s move to RS&I. The results were encouraging, but not as straightforward as for the other groups. Overall sales were up 6.7%, the operating margin at 22.1% compared to 22% last year. We did have higher restructuring charges this year that reduced margins by about 60 basis points, and adding in the lower margin Challenger sales also had an impact. These two items more than offset, was in fact a reasonable profit expansion in RS&I authored by rapid continuous improvement. ", "The overall RS&I sales gain included 15.2 million of Challenger lifts with only a small organic increase, reflecting primarily the wind-down of some essential tool programs at the OEM dealerships which we discussed quite a bit last year, if you might remember. As many of you know the essential tool business does tend to be a bit lumpy, thus the tough comparison in the OEM space. I will say that in this year\u2019s first quarter, we also had some new programs. So we actually don\u2019t see the OEMs are pulling back. ", "This comparison just reflects the nature of this type of business and that lumpiness largely offsets the real progress with the diagnostics and repair information products we're selling into independent shop owners and managers. We have seen those increases with independents for some time and the gains continues in the first quarter. It\u2019s an encouraging picture. The combination of new handheld diagnostic units, repair information, the expert knowledge of Mitchell 1 SureTrack offering along with under car equipment line up of tire changes, imaging of liners and lifts, have established significant momentum with both individual and independent shops, and with a large multi-location repair chains.", "We have also broadened or medium and heavy duty product offering over the past years, adding specially aimed repair information and diagnostic units. And its paid off. We had a significant win in recognition recently in this heavy duty sector when our diagnostic information from Mitchell was integrated into Navistar\u2019s Oncommand Connection Remote Diagnostic and Fleet Management System. The combination is designed to increase vehicle uptime and provide improved fleet management efficiency. ", "It will give more shops across to merit a greater access to the broad range of the Mitchell 1 features that make repairing all makes of commercial trucks, class IV through VIII easier with engine fault code diagnostics repair procedures, wiring diagrams, test steps and removal or installation instructions. It\u2019s a one clear example of building positions with garage owners and managers in the heavy-duty space. And that growing presence is driving new business with large organizations that run mixed fleet, car and truck, they need to support both vehicle types, and increasingly Snap-on has the answer. Because of that, we're seeing more fleet business with big companies, with utilities, and with governments both city and state. ", "Now the strength of the RS&I portfolio was also evident this past quarter at the National Automotive Dealer Association show, the NADA show in New Orleans earlier this year. Our operations came together under a tool shop solutions, a total shop solutions banner, it allows Snap-on to clearly demonstrate the depth and breadth of our offering to support OEM dealerships and the Challenger acquisition has been an important part of that depth, that portfolio. We believe that operation would be -- we believe when we acquired it, that that operation would be a fine addition to Snap-on and RS&I and that\u2019s certainly proven to be true.", "As evidenced, I\u2019ll just point to the lift that Challenger develops specifically for the quick service space that are becoming so common in OEM service centres. It\u2019s gotten some strong endorsements and it\u2019s another example of how we\u2019re able to expand the Snap-on presence with repair garage owners and managers.", "So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics and repair information for cars and trucks and a growing under car equipment line that now includes Challenger lifts, progress with independence with multi-location automotive repair chain and with the important medium and heavy duty segment; we see positive trends and improved position with repair shop owners and managers. So that\u2019s the highlight of our quarter, growth and improvement.", "Sales up 5% organically, overcoming the remaining headwinds. OI margins 15.5%, up 100 basis points. C&I strength with critical industry showing their potential, the tools group growing again continuing to enhance our franchise network with success. RS&I building its position and its product line with particular success and independent shops and financial services raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo.", "Aldo Pagliari", "", "Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results, I summarized on Slide 6, net sales of $787.5 million in the quarter increased $45.8 million or 6.2% from 2013 levels reflecting sales gains across all segments. Organically, sales increased 5% excluding $15.2 million of sales from the Challenger Lifts acquisition and an unfavourable $5.9 million impact from foreign currency translation. The 5% organic sales increased primarily reflect sales gains in our businesses serving critical industries as well as those calling out automotive technicians and providing diagnostics and information products and independent repair shop owners and managers.", "Consolidated gross profit of $378.7 million increased $21.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross margin of 48.1% in the quarter was unchanged from prior year levels. As savings from on-going rapid continuous improvement or RCI, initiatives were largely offset by unfavourable foreign currency effects and the impact of lower margin Challenger products. Operating expenses of $257 million increased 7.9 million while the operating expense margin of 32.6% improved 100 basis points from 33.6% a year ago primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and the effects of the Challenger acquisition partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $121.7 million in the quarter including $5.3 million or 60 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects increased to $13.9 million and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 15.5%.

Nick.", "Nicholas Pinchuk ", "", "Thanks Aldo. Well as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more clear evidence of potential and they are added confirmation of what we\u2019ve been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant and wide runways for both improvements and for growth. We believe the quarter\u2019s performance adds to a long trend which reinforces that outlook.", "We are moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, sales growing by 6% new products strong franchise metrics and a credit company is amplifying that strength. Expanding repair shop owners and managers, new diagnostics and information products, growing stronger with independent shops, Challenger Lifts giving us more to sell, extending the critical industries C&I growing organically at 10% with over 200 basis with an over 200 basis points increase in OI margins and building in emerging markets, ramping up our new lift factory and growing even in a place like India where economic and election uncertainty are major headwinds today.", "We\u2019re also progressing down our runways for improvements, Snap-on value creation, safety, quality customer connection innovation and RCI driving margin gains. So we\u2019re encouraged by the continuing trends, but we believe there is much more ample opportunities and clear runway for growing and improving. And we believe that with the inherent advantages we hold, the investments we\u2019re making and the capable team we\u2019re enlisting, we will extend on a positive trend for the foreseeable future.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, I believe it\u2019s appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that once again, many of you are listening. The encouraging results of the first quarter and the positive trends we\u2019re demonstrating are direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. For the role you play in our on-going achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from David Leiker with Robert Baird.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Hi good morning. This is Joe Vruwink on line for David. I wanted to start, is it possible to quantify any impact weather might have had on the tools group in the quarter? I\u2019d imagine some of the van routes were impacted and obviously fewer repairs are going on, mechanics have less money in their pockets. So, anyway to quantify that?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "The short answer is no. My response to that it\u2019s always something. And so yes, we had some tough winter and routes were attenuated in some time and I rode a number of these vans and when you stop at garage, I think I said this on the last call. Some guys say business is great, because we\u2019re tearing up transmissions and chassis are getting bumped around and so there is lot of business here. Other people are saying, hey the business is terrible. So it\u2019s hard to quantify it. Certainly it might have imposed some cauterization on us a little bit. But I think for our perspective, we\u2019re not really looking at it as something that is that unusual, just something that comes up and we manage over it.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "May be as the quarter progressed, so we obviously started getting better weather in March, April has been a little bit better I suppose, has your sales activity picked up kind of in line with that cadence?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well yes, but it's hard to quantify Joe because to tell you the truth last year, if you looked at last year we had people seem to go on a sabbatical in early January, so we had a kind of back end loaded cauterization, it tends to happen from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So there isn\u2019t always great intelligence looking from months to months. So yes, we did see some uptick but I am not sure you can read that much into that.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And then just looking at the origination growth and financial services, if I kind of use that as a parameter for activity in the tools business 18% obviously a lot higher than the 6% organic growth for the segments. Is there a way to kind of understand the disconnect there and is 18% so parameter for barometer for just generally\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "What I can give you -- unfortunately from quarter to quarter, it\u2019s hard to tie it exactly because there is a -- what we say is and you have probably heard us say this over and over is that the originations should roughly follow the growth of the tools groups big ticket items which is primarily tools storage in some of the larger diagnostics. So a matter of fact over the last several quarters and in again this quarter, big ticket grew greater that the tools group in general so you have that factor.", "Now in the full year we believe that comes out roughly parallel as the originations and big ticket sales roughly parallel, tools group big ticket sales and originations roughly are parallel and all work out. But from a quarter to quarter remember, we\u2019re recognizing a sale to a franchisee. He is not necessarily selling it right away onwards, he necessarily doesn\u2019t do the deal, so you have some disconnect in terms of cauterization as you cross over the month, so it\u2019s very hard to tie quarterly numbers between originations in the tools group. I will tell you that it is indications that tools group big ticket sales were sold at higher rates year over year than the average tools group and that\u2019s true in this quarter.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. And then...", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Other than you can\u2019t really draw much from one quarter.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Sure, that makes sense. Switching across the pond and looking at Europe, you talk a lot about runways for growth and I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the runway in Europe not only from revenues, but Nick you think restructuring Europe C&I I think your entire 10 year at Snap-on, so what could be the OpEx goal?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "It seems like it. I hate to comment on Europe anymore because I am usually wrong. But the thing is look, what happened in Europe, what\u2019s happened in Europe is we have been continually applying Snap-on value creation, improving our productivity and efficiency even in the darkest of downturns, we have said that our customers have not gone away therefore in doing this whether it\u2019s restructuring, in closing facilities or in creating efficiencies we have not removed productive capacity. So as I said in my remarks, that started to come home with positive traction several quarters ago where SNA Europe our European hand tool business was showing improvements and profitability even as the sales were going down. ", "And now with the sales going upwards, it adds that, that leverage adds that because there is good leverage because we didn\u2019t take out any productive capacity. Remember that when you talk about where is Europe and as Europe turn the corner and what\u2019s happening in Europe, it\u2019s still down 20% to 25% from the peak. So we\u2019re coming, we\u2019re literally coming off the canvas. So while we\u2019ve had two quarters, I am still from Missouri to see where we\u2019re going for a longer term, still it\u2019s a positive event and it contributed nicely to C&I although it was not the only contributor to C&I.", "Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. So when I think about your former peak margin in C&I at 13% in 2008, you're doing 13.5 now and so with Europe 20% or 25% off the top, fair to say that there is still a lot more upside there?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure I\u2019ve always said that I believe there is a lot of runway in C&I actually I am pretty bullish about the C&I business, it\u2019s just that C&I been the repository of headwinds I think, they have military, they had the European headwinds and so on, so they\u2019ve had some difficult bumps, but we feel confident about that business, SNA Europe, the critical industries those are great businesses.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Nick you talked about the Snap-on tools doing well internationally. Is one country or another doing particularly well or are you seeing just very solid international growth?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, generally I would say if you look back over, I think I talked about Snap-on tools growing over the years like 9% and 9.2% and 10.7% and 7.6% last year and if you look over the 16 quarters that are involved in that international grew pretty well in general. This particular quarter, UK grew nicely, better than -- about may be little bit better than the average. Canada grew even more. Australia actually was down slightly, down slightly. Some of that could have been currency. The tools group, man they got hammered with currency in terms of transaction because you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar weakening and you got the Aussie dollar weakening versus the U.S. dollar where we make the products we\u2019re moving into those markets and U.S. dollars we\u2019re shipping them in, and so does transaction impact. And so that played out a little bit in the Australian volume I think. UK has been across the company, pretty strong. I think on balance, you could say international is pretty good, but color in this quarter, Australia is may be feeling the weight of the currency problem a little bit.", "Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great, and Aldo you had DSO step up three days. Is that timing or is this something different? Is it more international?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I would say above one-day due to the timing of sales where they fall in the collection cycle. But what you are seeing there, you\u2019re spot on. The international mix is a little bit more robust. The term structurally in the international markets tends to be longer than that in the U.S. And then behind-the-scenes you have the fact that military is a little bit less than what it had been in prior years. The government's pays quick and the governments often times even uses credit cards. So that always helped to be a sole calculation. ", "And then finally, if you look at emerging markets, those places that have some spot liquidity issues, places you look like at China, India, Brazil, you have a lot less cash-and-carry business, and the result, in distribution circles there you have to provide little bit more structural terms. That's normal. It goes with the terms, so as those markets mature, in our presence, and then mature, I think you will see a little bit more classic dated outstanding rather than cash-and-carry type activities. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we will take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Good morning all, can you hear me, all right, because I am on a cellphone?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We have a little background, but we can hear you fine.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "That\u2019s because I\u2019m at the airport but anyway, Nick when you look at that dealer business, you said those re-facilitations were winding down. If you back out some of that business that\u2019s winding down, do you have a sense of just what the growth was just to dealers overall?", "", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don't have a dealer overall growth, but I'd say it\u2019s -- if you look at our -- one of the things that I wanted to say was is that I think we said in the call that RS&I would grow without the wind down of the dealerships. And we think it'd be mid-single digits, that kind of growth, if you pull out that OEM lumpiness. If you went back to our earnings calls last year, it was growing, we had some pretty good growth in RS&I; we are saying that some of that was accelerated by some of these movements. So, we said overtime that RS&I, the margins can be moved by that and also the growth can be a little bit lumpy. We are actually pretty pleased with it because the other businesses, particularly in the independent space are growing nicely.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, it just makes sense because the dealerships are doing well too overall. And then, in terms of -- do you have any facilities business, et cetera in the Ukraine?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, we have some business in the Ukraine. We have a sales office there. But its peanuts, you know, I mean really Ukraine is not -- it\u2019s a very-very small exposure at the Ukraine. If you talk about the Ukraine and Russia, it\u2019s a little bit bigger, but it\u2019s still a smaller piece of the business, maybe 1% of the total for the organization. And that business, and these numbers are down, already and these numbers are down multiple decades. We have seen -- we saw some headwind here.", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly I had another question on just the growth in the tool business in Europe, but if you look at your business overall in Europe, you know the southern tier countries had always been very sluggish and declines really the northern countries had been doing a little bit better. Are you starting to see a pickup in places like Spain, Italy, countries like that? Are you starting to see any growth in revenues out of those countries? Or is it specifically all the north countries?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure. No-no-no, actually we see revenue growth in our tools business; the SNA-Europe business in Spain and Italy, Portugal, actually France even, and Germany and so on. So we see -- sort of a center of Europe, UK is pretty good. The Eastern European businesses, as you might expect, are weak. There is some growth in Turkey, for example. So that\u2019s kind of pushing it. I will say that, sometimes I think we went so down so far in Spain and Portugal that any kind of growth, just kind of not so big but it's still positive from what we see. It\u2019s so positive and encouraging event, yes. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research ", "", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, good morning everyone. Can you talk about the extent to which your growth in international business may have supported the large origination number?", "Aldo Pagliari", "", "I will take that. It was fairly evenly balanced. But the originations are still more influenced by the activity in the United States. So certainly you can look at the International portfolio grew as well, but no one do buy us one way or the other. ", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, and you mentioned that the origination should converge with the tools business over the course of the year, that from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, you can see divergence a bit over the course of the year that should converge. So does that imply that we\u2019re going to see a fairly substantial reduction heading into 2Q and 3Q here in the origination?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, I didn\u2019t actually say, what I said specifically was it should converge with big ticket sales in the tools group.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, good.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "And so that doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate exactly with the overall tools group number, in fact for many quarters they\u2019ve been higher.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then within that big ticket, you talked about the fact I guess storage and diagnostics are really driving the big ticket within the tools segment as I understand. Do we begin to anniversary something here in the next quarter or two that would create a substantially slower year over year growth?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I don\u2019t know. I think -- look I have said forever that I think we expect our growth to be at 4% to 6% organically and this is at the top end and we grew like I said at 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6% in the past year, so that will be outside that. So eventually you might expect the tools group to come down to where I said, but we have some great strengths in the tools group. We are ramping up the innovation engine with customer connection and innovation so we have more new products than ever before. We have these new marketing activities which are breaking the boundaries of the van, the Rock N' Roll Cab that has 56 on the road now and they are breaking the space constraint and adding to that tools storage and we\u2019ve raised the Techno-Vans which support the diagnostic sales to 18. A year ago, those numbers 56 and 18 were 36 and 4 and two years ago were just 18. So we are pumping more support into the tools group. So I wouldn\u2019t want to call for a cooling on the other hand we do say over time it\u2019s 4% to 6%. I am not saying it\u2019s going to happen, that we\u2019d see a reduction next quarter though, I don\u2019t see a lapping being a factor.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Just a couple other questions, I guess on the change in working investments. Aldo you went into some detail about the things that are stressing your DSOs and that was helpful. I noticed though that going back over say the last two years, first quarter \u201912 it was a 13.9 good guy in \u201913 it was negative 55, and in \u201914 were negative 42.5. Is that reflecting just the structural shift so the growing international business, the slowdown in military, the things that Aldo discussed here, is there something else going on there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think the same variables do characterize, you\u2019re talking about just the receivables element in working capital is that [Multiple Speakers] are longer that\u2019s a fact of life. The international mix of business does then impact that, emerging markets as they mature does move from a certain percent of business being as I said cash and carry and short term oriented to more traditional distributor terms. And finally the realization of the government is a little bit of a less of a player in our mix. They were one of the ones that have the most rapid payment terms usually and they do pay properly.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I\u2019ll just jump in here, one of the things that is going on here is, if you shipped to C&I, I think we have of course the great progress in Europe where we\u2019ve gotten another quarter of growth and we have been pounding Snap-on value creation, so we have nice leverage rolling out of that. ", "But, there is also a great component of extension to critical industries where we had some big wins in aviation, those are very profitable but they\u2019re not the military business, they change the nature of the payable of the receivables and we are not only in aviation, but we\u2019re also extending internationally. One of the things we worried about in critical industries where we able to project and roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage into aviation and oil and gas and those things, and that\u2019s working. And then further than that, are you able to project it internationally, well that\u2019s really working this quarter and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driven, that\u2019s one of the big factor, may be the biggest factor in driving the 10.4% growth in C&I and a great component of the 200 basis points improvement.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes, okay. And the last question if I could, just last question, you paid down 100 million of debt in the quarter. Clearly the balance sheet is over capitalized at this point. I don\u2019t want to be the guy to force or pound the table, but you need to do acquisitions I hate to see you stress that. But what is your thought process on just using some of this capitalization capacity to buyback more stock rather than wait for opportunities to surface on the M&A front?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, I think we\u2019ve made it clear that, two factors I\u2019ll say, our priorities for cash are; working capital investment and the organic business you just pointed out, some of the requirements we can have as we expand our business to different places. We see it in our working capital today; we\u2019re growing but its eating working capital. We knew this was coming. We are looking at M&A. We view each months, we\u2019re reviewing a list of M&A and we will act on this and we\u2019re confident we can find targets because we keep looking at severely each month; thirdly, we keep our dividend in perpetuity and we know our investors like that dividend, like those dividends and it depends on it, and then the idea of buying back stock to offset dilution. We see that as our cash priority. And I would add on top of that though, that\u2019s our current cash priority, but I would add on top of it, we know that as we generate cash and have capability, we will be judged on how we wheel that, we know that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Are you considering large transformative acquisitions or are they...", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No nothing transformative. We think we can make acquisitions, we\u2019ve seen several large acquisitions that didn\u2019t quite work out that were sort of semi-coherent, on closer look it wasn\u2019t. We believe we can make acquisitions that give us more to sell and more strength with the customer basis that are along our runways for growth, that is the technicians, the repair shop owners and managers, people in the critical industries are in emerging markets. And we can do that without having to transform.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So if we got to the end of the year and you still hadn\u2019t done a larger transaction, you still had the kind of overcapitalized balance sheet you have today. Would you consider accelerating share repurchase activity?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I am not sure. I\u2019d wait till I get to the end of the year at that.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll go to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", "", "I wanted to ask about, on the military spending, has that now completely anniversaried, in other words the first quarter last year was the quarter where we really saw a big decline in that area of the business, correct?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Actually I think it was the fourth quarter of the prior year, but if the answer is it completely anniversaried, the answer is no, because it keeps going down but the base is smaller. So the impact on us -- it isn\u2019t that it didn\u2019t impact us, it did. But the base on which the reduction is operating is smaller; therefore it\u2019s less of an irritant. It doesn\u2019t create the screen in C&I that it did before. So the way I characterize in my script and I think this is accurate, it no longer masks some of the progress that was happening because it\u2019s smaller.", "I mean basically that business is down, more than half, its way down. So it keeps coming down, and was down in the quarter couple of decades of percentages. So it was down again, but the base that it operates thus far.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", "Is the European hand tools business that you mentioned that improved for the first time in quite a while? Was that down about the same kind of magnitude that military was down?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, not that much but it was down let\u2019s say 25% in sales.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", "And then on the Challenger Lift business, is the nature of that equipment and the historic margins such that this would represent, always represent margins that are less than that segment\u2019s average and therefore if sales in that business increase more so than the sales in the rest of RS&I, it would cause margins to be slightly diluted?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "If the question is, I mean I think this is the question. Is the Challenger margin -- are the Challenger margins 23%? The answer is no. And therefore for some time and for either substantially lower than that, so for some time growth in Challenger margins, [indiscernible] Challenger sales would be detrimental to the overall RS&I margin numbers. However it might help, it might raise its profitability for the corporation and so on. And by the way, we\u2019ll be working on the Challenger margins over time with Snap-on value creation to keep improving it. But there is a big gap between the Snap-on, between the Challenger margins and the overall RS&I margins.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", " ", "That gap is what is actually I was getting at and what I was getting at is that is Challenger is just the nature of this product and the pricing in that segment of the business such that you\u2019ll never get to the 20 some odd percent that the RS&I group does, it will always be lower than that general mark.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, yes, I guess, I mean I think is sure always is a long time even for a guy like me. And I have a lot of confidence in Snap-on value creation, so I think it can move it upwards. So I would never see the idea that never get there. But it\u2019s certainly a long pull. Now remember though, that we lap the acquisition in the second quarter. So we acquired Challenger, I don\u2019t know half way to two-thirds of the way through the second quarter of last year. So once we get into the third quarter, its apples-to-apples. What you\u2019re seeing now with the drag is in apples-to-oranges comparison, that\u2019s why we (want) [ph] it out.", "I mean RS&I actually had a pretty good quarter, it had 60 basis points of restructuring impact year-over-year and another multiple decade, a doll-up of Challenger impact and that occluded the relatively strong RCI achievement that it made in the 50 to 60 basis points.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.", "Certainly was an impressive quarter on margin performance. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.", "Operator", "And we have no further question in the queue at this time.", "Leslie Kratcoski ", "Thanks everyone for joining us this morning, a replay of the call will be available on snapon.com shortly.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website, next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start today with some of the highlights of our second quarter, the general environment and the trends we're seeing, as well as some of the progress we made. And Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "Our second quarter results were encouraging. They offer strong evidence of Snap-on advancements along our run rates for both growth and for improvement. Our sales were up 8.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. And the earnings per share, they reached $1.80, up 20%, compared with the $1.50 reported last year.", "The organic sales increase was 6.6%. Incremental sales from our Challenger acquisition in May of last year, and coupled with our acquisition of Pro-Cut this past quarter, added another $10.5 million, which, along with $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency, brought our total sales for the period to $826.5 million. The operating margin for opco reached 16.7%, up from 15.4% in 2013.", "Financial Services' operating income increased to $34.8 million from last year's $30.6 million, driving the consolidated operating margin to 19.7%, also up 130 basis points.", "Now from a macro perspective, we believe the favorable conditions remain for our businesses serving automotive repair customers; the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. Both have continued to experience strong demand, and in the second quarter, both of them reached new sales levels.", "Tools Group activity increased 6.6%. The strength of our band channel is clearly evident in those numbers and in the [indiscernible]. RS&I had an overall -- had overall organic gains of 7.7%, led by significant essential tool and facilitation sales in OEM dealerships.", "For the C&I group, for C&I, there are also continued signs of improvement along our runways for growth. We saw important and clear progress in our efforts extending to critical industries, and in building the physicals in the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific. U.S. Military activity. It's been a significant C&I headwind. Well, the military experience is somewhat of a resurgence, up double digits from the second quarter of last year, the first year-over-year increase since mid-2012.", "The C&I results are positive. We do, however, remain cautious as to the improvement within the U.S. Military business. At this point, the length and the amplitude of any recovery is quite uncertain.", "With that said, though, the opportunities for C&I definitely outweigh the challenges, and the results confirm it. More broadly, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes: safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. They drive our improvement every day, and they helped author our 130-basis-point gain this quarter.", "As I speak to the segment results, I'll highlight some of those advancements in both growth and in improvement. Let's start with C&I. I just said -- as I just said, an 8.4% organic sales increase. The group's operating margin was up 70 basis points, even while overcoming an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 80 basis points. Both higher volumes and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove the margin improvement, more than offsetting the currency.", "Related to the volume, there were some positive gains in the group's operating unit. SNA Europe had its third straight quarter of year-over-year group -- growth, a promising trend, outperforming the present economic conditions within its own markets. SNA Europe also showed clear margin improvements in the quarter, capitalizing on the volume increases, leveraging the uptick in activity and realizing the benefits of RCI and past restructuring actions. That effect was evident in SNA Europe's growing profitability.", "Also in C&I, the Industrial division saw particularly strong volume in the critical aviation sector, and it's a continuation of favorable trends we saw in the first quarter. And besides the encouraging trend -- the encouraging aerospace volume, the quarter also saw a success in extending to other critical industries like natural resources, where sales were up double digits.", "Some of those gains -- some of these gains can be attributed to a growing line of innovative products, guided by strong customer connections, specifically designed for critical applications. One such product was just launched aimed at the power generation industry. It was the K3477, our ground-mounted transformer access tool. This new utility tool is perfect for removing or securing the penta-style bolts on underground utility transformers. It's also effective in a variety of other applications in the power generation and delivery industry.", "The K3477 features a pentagon socket at one end and a 3/4 hex socket at the other. The pentagon side gains access and the hex side is used on the terminals inside the transformer. The new unit employs the Snap-on -- importantly, the new unit employs the Snap-on award-winning Dual 80 ratchet technology for smooth performance, enabling the smallest of ratchet swings, very helpful in tight quarters within a transformer box. The K3477, another tool born from Snap-on customer connection, making work easier for professionals and workplaces of consequence.", "Reaching to new markets, the Industrial division organized hands-on product training just for its Latin American region. The meeting was attended by about 125 customers and a number of our sales reps. It included a series of in-depth technical training sessions, familiarizing customers with our latest product offering, emphasizing opportunities across the continents in multiple segments, areas like mining, oil and gas, aerospace. Industrial -- our Industrial division, rolling out of the garage, reaching new segments and new geographies like Latin America.", "Industrial is also working to create more customers for life in technical education. We continue to add to our list of Snap-on certified schools. Already this year, 35 new institutions have embraced our certification protocols, helping us lead in providing top-notch curriculums to the technicians of the future.", "We continue to build in emerging economies, areas of strong potential, and we saw sales progress in bellwether markets like China and India, activity up nicely compared to last year. C&I did have a positive quarter. It did have a positive quarter. And we know there's even more opportunity, and we're continuing in the pursuit.", "Let's move to the Tools Group. Sales increased 6.6% organically. Operating margin of 16.4% was also up, versus the 15.7% recorded last year, overcoming within the quarter 60 basis points of unfavorable currency impacts largely related to our operations in Australia and Canada.", "The 70 basis point brings our Tools Group OI margins to new levels, and that performance clearly speaks to our improving position. And when combined with the growth this quarter, it clearly demonstrates the vast -- the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchisee channel.", "You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchisee health metrics, trending positively again this quarter. Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable force, and we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products. New products like our Push-Pull Spring Tool range, designed to remove and install springs on automobiles, heavy-duty trucks and agricultural equipment with precision and speed.", "You see, today's techs commonly use picks and screwdrivers for these applications. These standards -- but these standard tools sometimes slip, causing the spring to go flying or to drop into the mechanism. It's a productivity killer. Snap-on's Push-Pull Spring units are uniquely designed with a robust shank and a deep V- and C-shaped grooves to securely hold and maneuver small- and medium-sized springs. It's a winning tool line shaped by direct observation, customer trial and feedback.", "Products like our power tools, our 14 -- our new power tools. So 14 -- let's take one. A 14.4-volt, 3/8-inch cordless impact wrench, high torque, small size, power in your product -- in your pocket. This impact gun and its twin, the 14.4-volt cordless screwdriver, combine to display Snap-on innovation and to help drive the Tools Group volume.", "On another front, the growing strength of our Tools Group marketing is also evident with the increases in big-ticket sales. And a lot of that credit goes to Snap-on hands-on demonstration vehicles, the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express vans, both driving excitement and sales. The Rock 'N Roll Express showcases a broad range of Snap-on tool storage -- of the Snap-on tool storage line, colors, shapes, options. You've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard that the product variety made available for hands-on selection on the Rock 'N Roll van is a significant contributor to the Tools Group growth.", "For handheld diagnostics, the TechKnow Express vans. The TechKnow Express vans follow the path blazed by the Rock 'N Roll Express, offering customers the ability to touch and to feel and to navigate. In essence, try out our assortment of diagnostic solutions, easing the way to make that big-ticket buying decision, all under one roof. And we keep adding to our TechKnow fleet. We now have 24 with more on the way.", "Another advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big-ticket categories of tool storage and diagnostics. Again this quarter, our credit company played an essential role in enhancing our van channel and helping us drive the sales growth. Well, that's the Tools Group. Attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit capability, all helping the vans reach new levels.", "Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales growth of 7.7%, while the second quarter operating margin of 23.2%, 23.2%, compared to last year's 23%. The overall sales gain was $32.3 million, or 13.1%. $19.1 million of organic sales, $2.7 million of favorable currency, and $10.5 million of sales from our acquisition Challenger Lifts and our recent add, Pro-Cut International. We're excited to add Pro-Cut to the portfolio, a well-established brand that complements the RS&I lineup. Challenger Lifts and the newly acquired Pro-Cut advance brake servicing product line, both giving us more to sell to vehicle repair shop owners and managers, to customers and independent shops and national service chains and in OEM dealerships. They're both positive steps along our runway for coherent growth in the repair garage.", "Beyond acquisitions, RS&I registered organic sales gains across the group, from repair information to diagnostic products within independent repair shops, to program activity in support of OEM dealerships. The robust organic sales were driven, in part, by innovation in new product lines. In April, a new product launch -- in April, the diagnostic division was, again, voted the Top 10 tool Award winner by the readers of Undercar Digest magazine. These awards are determined by technicians and shop owners, the people who use diagnostics every day to make their living. And they voted 2 Snap-on handheld units, the VERUS PRO and the ETHOS Plus, as being among their most important tools.", "This, again, -- This, again, extends our string of Undercar Digest Top 10 Awards for Snap-on diagnostics. Our past winners include, listen to this list, VERUS, VERDICT, SOLUS PRO, SOLUS Ultra, and now the VERUS PRO and ETHOS Plus, a parade of innovation.", "New products also helped bolster our sales in our OEM solution business, up double digits in the quarter. One assist in that growth was our expansion in the agricultural sector. In the period, we launched distribution of the essential diagnostic system for a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment, with repair outlets over 5 continents. The system will be used in 6 facilities and in mobile shops to deliver diagnostic repair services across the globe. We like this program. It has strategic -- it has significant strategic importance in extending our diagnostic reach to new customers in another critical arena: agricultural equipment.", "Another product, another new product, the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra heavy-truck diagnostic tool, was also launched in the quarter. It's a next-generation device that'll make work easier in more than 60,000 heavy-duty shops throughout North America. This new unit helps diagnose and repair a variety of problems, including engine transmission and brake issues on commercial vehicles ranging from light diesels to Class 8 heavy-duty trucks.", "The PRO-LINK Ultra has a faster processor, includes more memory, is Wi-Fi enabled and incorporates updated OEM software and arrives preconfigured for a repair connect upgrade. That's Snap-on's proprietary system that allows users to link trouble codes with the most likely fixes based on our extensive library of real vehicle repair data.", "To wrap up RS&I, we've seen new diagnostics, unique repair information for cars and for trucks, and a growing undercar equipment offering that now adds both Challenger and Pro-Cut products to our established lines. Real strengths that are driving positive trends and have improved our positions with repair shop owners and managers, and you can see it in the results.", "Well, that's the highlights of the quarter: growth and improvement; sales up 6.6% organically, overcoming headwinds; OI margin of 16.7%, up 130 basis points; C&I strength with critical industries and with SNA Europe's ongoing improvement, the third straight quarter of year-over-year growth; the Tools Group getting stronger, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network with success; RS&I, advancing its position with gains in both independent shops and OEMs; and Financial Services, raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $826.5 million in the quarter increased $62.4 million, or 8.2%, from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all segments, and include higher sales to auto repair mechanics, customers in critical industries and OEM dealerships.", "Organically, sales increased 6.6%, excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $400.4 million increased $27.2 million from 2013 levels.", "Gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $262.3 million increased $6.9 million. The operating expenses margin of 31.7% improved 170 basis points from 33.4% a year ago, primarily due to sales volume leverage.", "Restructuring costs of $1.4 million in the quarter compares to $1.8 million of such costs last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $138.1 million in the quarter increased $20.3 million, or 17.2%, and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 16.7%.", "Operating earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million increased 13.7% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings totaled $172.2 million, and the operating margin of 19.7% improved 130 basis points from 18.4% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32.9% compared with 32.5% last year.", "Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $106.1 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $88.4 million, or $1.50 per share last year, representing a 20% increase in earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $287.2 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically, primarily reflecting a double-digit sales gain to customers in critical industries and a mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tool business.", "Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $111.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.9% decreased 70 basis points from last year, as benefits from increased sales and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives were more than offset by higher costs, including $2.7 million, or 80 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "Operating expenses of $73.6 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million over 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 25.6% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage.", "As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $38.2 million increased $4.6 million, or 13.7%, from 2013 levels; and the operating margin of 13.3% improved 70 basis points from 12.6% last year, despite 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $369.1 million increased 6.6% organically, reflecting a mid-single-digit sales increase in our U.S. franchise operations and a high single-digit sales increase in our international franchise operations.", "Gross profit of $161.1 million increased $8.2 million from 2013 levels, while the gross margin of 43.6% decreased 60 basis points, due to $2.1 million, or 60 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $100.6 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses.", "The operating expense margin of 27.2% improved 130 basis points from 28.5% last year, primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $60.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $6 million, or 11%; and the operating margin of 16.4% improved 70 basis points from 15.7%.", "Turning now to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $278.5 million increased $32.3 million, or 13.1%, from 2013 levels. Excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were up 7.7%, primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealership service and repair shops and a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.", "Gross profit of $127.5 million in the quarter increased $12.6 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 45.8% decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships, as well as sales of Challenger products. Continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives more than offset $0.6 million, or a higher restructuring cost.", "Operating expenses totaled $62.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 22.6% improved 110 basis points from 23.7% last year largely due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift discussed earlier. Second quarter operating earnings of $64.6 million for the RS&I group increased $7.9 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.2% in the quarter improved 20 basis points.", "Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million and revenues of $51.7 million compares with operating earnings of $30.6 million on revenue of $44.5 million last year.", "The average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% compared with 17.4% last year. The average yield on contract receivables of 9.5% compared with 9.6% last year. Originations of $232.7 million in the quarter increased 14.6% from 2013 levels.", "Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the second quarter, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew approximately $65 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $124.4 million in the quarter increased $14.3 million from comparable 2013 levels, primarily as a result of higher 2014 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $119.7 million included $58 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables, and also included $41.6 million for the previously communicated acquisition of Pro-Cut. Capital expenditures of $22.7 million in the quarter compared with $16.7 million last year.", "Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 64 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end and 65 days at the end of the first quarter.", "Inventories increased $33.1 million from 2013 year end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions, and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut.", "On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7x compared with turns of 3.8 at 2013 year end. The quarter-end cash position of $115.8 million decreased $101.8 million from 2013 year-end levels. That's primarily due to $100 million March 2014 debt repayment.", "The net decrease in cash also reflects the impacts of funding $370.6 million of new finance receivables; share repurchases of $62.5 million, or 550,000 shares; dividend payments of $51.2 million; the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.6 million; and $41 million of capital expenditures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $282.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $212.7 million of cash from operations.", "At the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-cap ratio was 26%. In addition to our $116 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $29.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "I'll conclude by mentioning a few outlook items. We continue to expect that our full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2013 rate of 32.3%, and we now anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million.", "With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more confirmation of our progress, but they're also clear evidence of the opportunities that remain. We've been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant runways -- abundant and wide runways for both improvement and for growth, and we believe that the quarter's performance adds to a long trend that reinforces that outlook.", "We are demonstrating clear gains moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network. Tools Group sales growing, operating earnings at new heights, innovative new products, strong franchisee metrics and a credit company amplifying that strength with greater effects, expanding with our repair shop owners and managers, RS&I growing, diagnostics and information products stronger with independent shops. A successful Challenger acquisition and a new Pro-Cut addition widening the product offering, extending to critical industries. C&I growing organically at 8.4% with a 70 basis point increase in OI margins, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. Rolling the Snap-On brand out of the garage to sectors like aviation and natural resources. SNA Europe clawing back. Building in emerging markets, the physicals getting stronger each quarter and seeing it in our market position. We're also progressing down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation of rapid continuous improvement, driving margin gains across the entire corporation.", "So we are encouraged by the continuing trends. Sales up 6.6% organically, opco OI margin reaching 16.7%, rising 130 basis points. But we believe there is much more, and we are confident that we're positioned with the capability and the intent to take full advantage and to continue our trajectory of positive performance for the foreseeable future.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that, once again, many of you are listening. Our progress in the second quarter and the positive trends are a direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. The role you play in our ongoing achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "In terms of Snap-on Tools, you have tools that are guaranteed for life. Now you're seeing a pretty nice growth out of that base market. Is it bigger-ticket items, is it new product introductions or is it market share that are contributing to this better-than-average, better-than-expected growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "That's a great question. One of the great questions I think is -- one of our big product lines are hand tools, we guarantee them for life. So how is it we have a business at all? And the answer is, is what happens in the marketplace, particularly in the auto repair marketplace, there's a tremendous motion of technology that creates the requirements, things like the spring tool, like the Push-Pull Spring Tool I talked about, and a number of other products. And so when you look at this business, you see -- first and foremost, you see innovative new products rolling out, because our Snap-on Value Creation around customer connection and innovation is working better before -- better than ever before, and we're having more hit products than we've ever had, 5 or 6 times what we had just in 2006. So you see a lot of those and that creates excitement. So we're doing that better. Underlying that is the change in the vehicles, that's one. Two is, we're reaching more customers because we're enabling our van drivers to be more effective. Part of that is really innovative marketing. Things like the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express, and other things we're doing on the van to make our drivers better. And this general productivity rolling through the van is pretty good. And then, thirdly, the credit company. Since we brought the credit company home, we've learned more things about credit than we ever thought we could, especially applied strategically in the marketplace. And all this is coming together with a team that's starting to learn this. And the Tools Group is singing. I mean, you see the sales of 6.6% this quarter, and I think that last second quarter it was 7%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 7.6%. Now, I'm not -- as I say, we think -- we say we're going to grow organically at 4% to 6%, and the Tools Group, by all rights, should be at the lower end of that, and that's what we keep saying. But our team in the Tools Group is doing a great job, and they are expanding their position. I'm not going to say we have a bigger market share, but I kind of like the numbers.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And real quickly on C&I, you see -- continuing to see some momentum build in Europe. Are there any verticals or critical industries that are doing particularly well?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, I think Europe, the play is more by country, perhaps you might say that. I mean, I think no particular industry. I don't think you're seeing the construction industry come back too quickly. And we felt -- in some of that, the agricultural industries are good, big industry is good, aviation is okay. But I want to emphasize what I said in my call, we're growing mid-single digits in Europe in places like Germany and France and even Spain, the U.K., and this is defying the GDP. The GDP in Germany, for example, is forecasted in the second quarter at 1.8%, France is 0.4%, Spain is 1%, U.K. is 3.1%. So our guys are outgrowing the GDP. I just think it's the fact that we have had faith in that market. We're seeing our customers didn't go away, continuing to pound Snap-on Value Creation, making them more efficient and, in one of the more efficient places, is developing better products, more innovative products. And that's playing out now that they're seeing even a little sliver of daylight. That's what's working for us there. There's nothing particularly special, I think it's just being in a proper position when a little bit of opportunity presents itself.", "Operator", "And we'll now take our next question from David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on the organic growth. It seems like -- well, it doesn't seem like, we've had an acceleration in the growth rates, the 6.6% across the company. My numbers show that's the best since the first quarter of 2002. Do you think there's something in particular going on this quarter that's behind that? Or do you think this is an inflection higher and a new trend of a higher pace of sales than we've seen the last 2 years?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Look, it's better than a stick in the eye to see the 6.6%, of course. And I'm still sticking to my 4% to 6%. I think we're quite pleased with what we saw in the second quarter. We always know that -- and we're seeing positive trends, what are we, like, 5% in the first quarter and so on. So we're seeing our businesses start to become more effective, and I think there are elements inside these businesses that are working that way. I think as we look forward, I think we expect this kind of trend to continue, but I think 4% to 6% is the right -- are the right numbers. But when you look at these numbers, you feel certainly more encouraged about that 4% to 6%. As I've said on every quarter 2 call I've been on -- and I'm not pre-staging anything up or down -- the third quarter is always squirrely because we've got vacations and so on, where the technicians take vacation. They go to the FSC. They park their van and Europe is off in July and August, depending on where you are. And you'll never know when the distributors are going to come back, and so it's more difficult to predict that. But if I think if you look out over the trend, the quarters, we're going to see -- and I'm not predicting anything bad or -- in that, I'm just saying, there always is more turbulence, more windage in that quarter. Over time, I think this is got to be encouraging to us.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then if we look at the gross profit and the currency headwinds, Aldo, I think, or Nick, I don't remember which one, called out Australia and Canada in particular. Is that shifting from the U.S. into those markets?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "That's what it is.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "The transactional effect, where is that coming from?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Tools Group. And it hits us in 2 places. Those particular currencies, of course, you have translation because we have operations there, and they do okay. And so to the extent the Canadian dollar is smaller and the Australian dollar is weaker, there's an impact on translation both at the sales line and the operating income line. But the big effect was transaction, as you're referencing here, where we sell -- what we're talking about here mostly here in Canada is taking the Tools Group and selling out of the United States factories into those jurisdictions. And so what happens is, you've got a selling price that now is less in U.S. dollars, and so you try to punch it up, but it takes a while to move the selling price up to match that. And so you -- inevitably, when currencies go down, you have transaction effects, and that's what's happening there. The currencies -- where the currencies are now -- there's variations as we go through the year. But where the currencies are now, they -- I think they're about where they were at the end of last year, I think roughly, if you look at all the currencies together. So I don't see any trends for the end of the year, I don't see any changes in that currency position.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It sounds like you -- a lot of the transactional aspect of those maybe diminishing some, it sounds like you...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, maybe. I think, look, I think the advantage -- you might be entitled to the following. The -- when you look at the currencies and you start playing out month by month, there's a lot of variations. All I'm saying is when you get to the end of the year, there's a lot less variations from where we are now. So there's -- it goes in and goes out as you go through the year. But from an operating guy point of view, you might be entitled to the idea that if the currency drops, like in Australia and Canada, we'd be trying to push up the pricing to recapture some of that. That's where I -- yes, you would be.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And, I guess, the question is, as we look at it sequentially here, how long does it take for that pricing to start to flow through the numbers?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know. It's a long -- I can't give you any number. It's like -- you know how this works. Okay, you try to move the pricing up and maybe it doesn't hold so well and so on. So it's not an exact science. You just charge your operating guys with saying, \"Look, let's try to get some of this back.\" It doesn't always work. Sometimes it does work. For example, this time last year, we had a big ding in India, for example, and it took us a long time to get us back up and we're still not back up, but we got some of it back.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then the last item for me is you've done a great job across your businesses. Arguably in those businesses, you're outgrowing your competitors. What are you seeing across, I don't know, a couple of the businesses? Maybe you can do this. What are you seeing the competitive reaction, from your competitors as you guys continue to put up this strong performance?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I can only tell you what I hear from the people on the ground. And so I was just out at Joliet, where the drag race, we had the Nationals. The NHRA drag race out there, the Nationals, and we hosted 1,200 customers. I talked to a number of them, almost all of them probably. And they didn't mention the competition whatsoever. So I didn't hear anybody say -- hey, I'm not saying people aren't doing stuff. I'm not saying they aren't smart people. I'm not saying they're not aggressive in trying to do things. But what I'm getting feedback from in the operations and at the grassroots are mostly focused on how we can get better, how we can strengthen our position with the customer. It's all about our relationship with the customer. It's almost never \"Oh, I got this competition that's going to bother me.\" It's almost all focused on our relationship. And I think this is the kind of feedback you get from a market leader, of which we are clearly the leader in almost all these segments.", "Operator", "And we'll now take our next question from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I wanted to ask you -- clearly, you're benefiting from a lot of the innovation that you're taking to market. And I know, historically, there's been sort of a fairly set level of spending on innovation with respect to revenues. So I guess the question is just, what's gating you or limiting you from just accelerating your innovation investment? And where do you think the sort of the point of diminishing marginal returns are on that investment program?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I don't know. Look, I think what gates it is our own capability. At some level, we're not smart enough to do any more. And so part of it though is, I think -- that's one, and what I mean by that is this: our drive for innovation has to do with our observations in the field. It's not gated by the innovation back here. So in terms of that -- what I mean back here, I mean, at the center, the R&D labs and so on. So what I mean by that is we're gated by how many people for how many hours we have in the workplace. Our R&D spending is up, and it'll fluctuate from time to time, and we spend more in different places. And I guess you would say that over time, we're growing our capability, hiring more engineers. But in my view, the big pacing item is around the unique strategic value that Snap-on has. That is the understanding of the marketplace and the feedback of that understanding into the innovation system that creates these new products. As I talked about today, that tool for the transmission door -- for the power generation door, the transformer door -- that came out of observing how people service transformers. Somebody was there watching and said, \"Boy, we can save a lot of time.\" Or the thing with the springs. Somebody's in the garage watching the springs being unloaded or taken out of the vehicle and watching them fly all over the place, and watching mechanics chase them around. That fed back into, \"Boy, we can make this more productive.\" That's the key, and that's what feeds us. But it\u2019s a unique value and strategic advantage we have, and that's what we're wielding to greater effect now.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "How do you know you're pricing the innovation properly with so much innovation coming down the pipe? How do you explore kind of the upside or the elasticity?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Geez, I don't know. I think we're priced pretty high now. I mean, we think we're up there in terms of pricing. I don't think anybody's ever asked us, \"Are you too shy in your pricing?\" I don't think anybody's thought that. Now you could ask, \"Okay, where do you price it?\" And I think we get that from the field. We have our franchisees, our franchise performance teams that are out there and right -- if you want to take the Tools Group. And with technicians who are out there all the time in the marketplace, and they have a feel for what a tool will sell for. And I think then we kind of price off our own -- our former tool and say, \"How much innovation is this? How much would it be worth for the customer? How flashy will this be?\" And we make a judgment. It's probably not as analytic as you would hope in some orbs, but our position in the marketplace is more an art informed by tremendous understanding of the customer.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Second question, just -- obviously, you've had a lot of success with the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express, the TechKnow Van. It's been driving big-ticket sales. It's been driving growth in the Tools segment. But if you exclude those big-ticket storage and diagnostics business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of possible acceleration and growth for sockets and wrenches and just the core tool [indiscernible]?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Actually, the sockets and the wrenches are up somewhat higher than the average this quarter. So that's going okay. I think -- yes, the sockets might be up higher, so that's -- so we don't see any diminutization of that, I don't think. I think -- look, I think you could argue that to the extent that we have more innovation and we punch into new areas and come up with more ideas that aren't exactly wrenches and sockets, they become a smaller percentage, of course, but they're no less important. In fact, I was on a van in Encino, California last week. One of our van drivers, Matt Scott, he took me around to a Mercedes dealer and a Tesla dealer where I saw a huge number of Snap-on tools and Snap-on boxes. And a couple of young technicians got on the van. Mark Scott [ph], he had been technician for like 5 years, and Juan Gutierrez [ph] gets on, and he's only 3 years. And they all have like -- they'll say, \"I have 5 or 6 ratchets already, but I need this special low-profile ratchet to get inside this particular product.\" So I think there is no shortage of need for innovative new hand tools, ratchets and sockets and wrenches, even with young technicians, even today, even at a place like Tesla.", "Operator", "And we will now take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research.", "Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered. But, Nick, in terms of what you're doing in the van channel with the Rock 'N Roll vans and the TechKnow vans, have you expanded that outside of the U.S. to other countries where you...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, we've got about 5 outside the U.S. I don't know -- sometimes when people say \"outside the U.S.,\" we're talking -- I think for purposes of the way you asked the question, yes, 53 of the 58 Rock 'N Roll cabs are inside the United States. We don't have one in Hawaii, I guess. We've got one in Puerto Rico. And we've got 4 or 5 in Canada, we've got 4 in Canada. So, yes, but there haven't been as pushed as far outside the U.S. Canada is -- the routes are broader, so there's a different approach there, I think. You could argue, \"Should they be in the U.K. and Australia?\" And we're looking at that now. Well, maybe there's an opportunity there, I'm not -- we're not sure yet.", "Operator", "And we will now take our next question from Richard Hilgert from Morningstar.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First one, looking at the Financial Services balance sheet. We've been expecting the growth rates on the receivables to progressively come down a little bit, because you've grown the base over the last 5 years, and as the company continues to grow, you're adding to that base, but the base is a much larger base. But we've seen here the first couple of quarters of this year that it seems like the growth in financial receivables has accelerated a little bit, and I was curious if there's anything going on there.", "Aldo J. Pagliari", "This is Aldo, Richard. First off, sure, the first half of the year has been a strong beginning for Financial Services, and it reflects -- if you go back over time, the trailing 12-month performance of our big-ticket items is really where the sweet spot for Financial Services does well, and it continues to do so. So we're pleased with that, and we work in concert with the Tools Group to organize programs that call attention both to the tools that we like to feature in the Tools Group and the innovative products that Nick described earlier, as well as programs that we have to make them attractive to the customers of the franchisees -- that is, the mechanics. So our participation rates have been a little bit better. And again, first half of the year has been pretty good for Snap-on Credit. Long way, we continue with the view that, over time, 90-plus percent of what the Financial Services unit does is in support of the Tools Group. And over time, it will reflect the long-term growth rates of that division. So that's still the advice that we give when we model it ourselves internally, and I guess when we talk to people like yourself.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Looking at the quarterly CapEx. That's, at an absolute level, one of the highest I've seen on a quarterly basis going back over the last 5 years. Are we going to see an acceleration in CapEx going forward beyond the $75 million, $80 million that we're looking at this year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "No. Look, I don't think so. I think just -- I think we said we were at $70 million to $80 million last quarter, now we said $75 million to $80 million. But this is just -- a few more projects came up that we thought we could invest in. They were talking about the tools factories in the United States, there's some investment in Asia, doing some in Europe and some in R&D or in our places here. I think you're seeing kind of noise in the quarter, and with a maybe slight bias for upward movement. But if I was -- shall I say, if I was a cash flow modeler, for example, I wouldn't be thinking that CapEx is going to explode or get much higher. It'll move up over time, but I'm not thinking we're going to double it or go up by 50% next year, or anything like that. Of course, I'd probably have a big project next quarter that I'll announce, but I don't think so.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then on the margins for the quarter being what they are, and Europe still being -- what is it, roughly 20% of overall revenue?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "That's about right.", "Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Yes, any thoughts to -- you've had this target out there of mid-cycle -- or pardon me, mid-teens EBITDA margins. But even with Europe and the softness over there, we've seen it come back this quarter, you're still able to generate an EBIT margin above 16.5%, EBITDA margin slightly ahead of 19%, that's excluding or having Financial Services on an equity basis. Any thoughts to maybe that target of yours moving up a little bit, given the progress you've made, but still having a big chunk of revenues still being slow?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Hey, look. Here's what I think I would say on that, and I think we've said this effect in other orbs. I think we're looking at the mid-teens in the rearview mirror, what we thought was the mid-teens, and so we're by that now. And that doesn't mean we won't have a quarter that's below that, don't -- that doesn't -- I don't mean that every quarter, or anything like that, but I'm talking about the trend. I think we've passed our goal that we set back in, what, 2005 or something like that, when we were back at 6.5% OI margin. We said mid-teens. But what we're saying -- I think we're viewing it going forward, it's not necessarily a target, but I'm telling you that absent macroeconomic turbulence of significance, we see -- we don't see ourselves being interrupted in terms of our growth. We do think that if we never got another dollar of incremental sales, we would be able to increase the margins because of Snap-on Value Creation and its effect on the operations, and there's so much more to improve. And secondly, we do believe though that we're not going to be flat. We think we have ample runways for growth in the van channel with the repair shop owners and managers, with the extending critical industries in emerging markets, and that's going to add leverage to that. So we see our margins continuing to go up at some pace, and we don't necessarily see a near-term ceiling to that. That doesn't mean there isn't a ceiling some place. But we're sitting here [indiscernible], we see that. So I'm not saying we're at a ceiling or anything like that.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kratcoski.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly, and, as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Thanks and have a great day.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's call.

Pagliari - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance", "Analysts", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year financial results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.", "Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise statements on management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increases and profit gains across our businesses, continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities, and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities, and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include a $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013. And that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points.", "Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly. And the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year.", "Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable, driven of course by expanding and aging car parts and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and the Repair Systems & and Information, or the RS&I, Group took advantage with volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress.", "But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe. Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our Industrial division, progress across a range of critical industries. And in a range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region.", "Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that the critical -- that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear. A significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend.", "So to wrap up the broad discussion of the markets, I'd summarize the situation as generally positive across our businesses. And know, we'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets.", "That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on Value Creation Processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, drives a significant and ongoing positive trend or performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that.", "Speaking of the full year, Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rose $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was -- of 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in organic growth of 6.9%.", "In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group. In the Tools Group, a strengthened van channel with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and managers, up 4.9% organically. And from the C&I Group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 9.5%. All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve.", "Now let's move to a discussion of the groups and their quarters. In the C&I Group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. The organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The Industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single-digit rise, offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia/Pacific division recorded higher activity, growing in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan.", "From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013.", "C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply, again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days, while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers.", "C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. Of particular note, I think, was our gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors. And one product line that has gained traction in these areas is our Tools at Height offering, drop prevention systems designed for a variety of industries and used to keep people safe and assets secure. Falling objects is a leading cause of accidents in the workplace. And a 3-pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary, but it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions. By ergonomically tethering our tools, we provide our customers an engineered attachment system, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities of tools used at height, but with safety.", "Guided by customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or in major power plants in the U.S., our Industrial division's Tools at Height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers performing critical tasks.", "The fourth quarter also grow -- saw a growth in the emerging markets of C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asian-ized products, products like our new GLS2P4 [ph] , the compact lift; or our new flexible -- our flexible new i-Aligner system, both ideal for the smaller footprints in Asian shops. And our expanding lineup of Blue-Point tool sets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-on Asia/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave, we believe, is coming in that emerging region.", "Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on it -- often about it on these calls, is our tool security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of critical tools.", "Well in the fourth quarter, the Industrial division reached a milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation -- at the aviation industry. But now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to more customers, helping drive C&I growth.", "Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis points from last year. We often mention Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles or our long-term sales opportunities, and always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel. Well the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that runway.", "But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top-500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction, recognized Snap-on as a top-50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award.", "And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees at the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian National Franchise Advisory Council. And again on our recent kick-off meetings across the country, each of the sessions generated valuable insight, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees.", "Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our band network as stronger than ever before.", "The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success -- of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with technicians or from the independent observations of our associates.", "An example of that customer connection and innovation is our newly introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing of power steering o-rings required removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the o-ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the o-ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor. And it's a winning timesaver, and I can tell you on the van, it's an attention grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, moving us down our runways for improvement, providing the means for an ongoing trajectory of positive performance.

Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs.", "In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated processor and easier viewing features, our new SOLUS Edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts.

The PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body control. It's the ideal tool for heavy duty fleets and dealerships, owner-operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services. And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional.", "Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single-digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on display in the form of the new Snap-on Motorized Wheel Balancer, ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sensor that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode, allowing users to flexibly match weight location to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-On's Virtual Plane Imaging technology, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer. The new Snap-on authorized balancer: speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues. We're very excited about this product.", "In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual SEAMS show in Las Vegas. The group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, new acquisitions, were featured along with our diagnostics; Mitchell 1, business solutions and equipment solutions product offering, all on display in one booth under the banner \"Snap-on Total Solution.\" Customer reaction was enthusiastic, and our sales for the event were strong.", "We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of repair information solutions and award-winning diagnostics products, is capturing an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it.

Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million, increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales, partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs.", "Operating expenses of $266.1 million increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 90 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. There were no restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter increased $21.6 million or 17.5% compared to the prior year; and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year.

As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio.

Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. We believe our fourth quarter and full year results are clear evidence of the abundant opportunities that lie along our strategic runways for growth and of our continuing progress of taking advantage of those possibilities and in achieving amidst challenge and turbulence. The vehicle repair market is both favorable economically and familiar operationally, and we are advancing in that arena. The van channel is being enhanced. The Tools Group is continuing to rise, sales up 11.8%, operating margin increased by 200 basis points. And we believe the franchise -- that franchisee confidence and capability are stronger than ever.", "We're expanding repair shop owners and managers, profitable growth in dealerships and independent shops, Pro-Cut and Challenger integrated smoothly giving us more to sell, an OI margin of 23.1% and volume growth of 6.9%. We're reaching into new areas for new customers, growing coherently. The extension to critical industry is working. Double-digit growth with those customers in the quarter, 4 straight quarters of robust increases. And we're building firm physical capabilities in emerging markets. Activity in China and in India, up nicely in the quarter. Put that progress together with our with commitment to Snap-on Value Creation, and you will see encouraging results. You see organic sales increases of 9.8% and a margin gain of 140 basis points to 16.9%. In fact, you see our fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we know there are headwinds. We know there are more challenges. But we also believe that our team has unique opportunity rooted in growth and improvement, and has the intent and the capability to continue our positive trend of strategic and financial progress, ensuring that we will exit 2015 stronger than when we entered.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I recognize our franchisees and associates, an extraordinary group. Once again, I know many of you are listening. Please know that this encouraging quarter is the result of your effort, for your contributions to our performance, for your support of our team and for your commitment to our future. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Hannah for questions. Hannah?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Nick, can you give us a little color on how much incremental growth you got from company-supplied vans, like the Rock 'N Roll van, to help supplement the van franchisee effort?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well -- yes, sure. Look, the Rock 'N Roll vans, as you know, are sort of like a time shared event, which add retail space on a time-sharing basis. Each of the -- each technician, they go around and they visit various technicians for 2 to 3 days. We've grown them from, I think, 18 in the first quarter of 2012, up to around 59 in North America last year. They're not growing anymore. But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead, greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% in the quarter. So they pace the -- they were among the pacing elements -- big-ticket items were among the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that the -- that those 59 in North America, and I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way. The TechKnow vans are now up, I think, to 31, which it started at 14. So those are both helping grow this business. And it has moved faster than at 11.8%.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And on new product introductions or innovation, did you have a good year in terms of hit products and were they divided equally between industrial and automotive?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I would say we had a good year, yes. I'm pretty positive about the year. We had some really fine new products and the numbers were the like last year. Compared to just, what, 2006, they're several times, as I said many times, that number. And I would say that they are divided, kind of, not quite equally. I'd say the Tools Group gets a little more of those because we have more people really in the workplaces for the automotive repair business, and therefore, those ideas are rolling back with greater frequency. But we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industries. And you know, I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industries, not hit products, but we're expanding that business. For example, we added in the year, 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, military products over 800, power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all the hit products. I'm not saying that, but we added new products to create excitement in that business. The hit products are those that sell over 1 million and create the excitement. We're getting those in industrial. We're still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, a very good year for that, I'm very pleased. And in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that it's generated by the enthusiasm and the attention-getting that these great new products get when people in the vans or when our salesmen call on customers and say, \"Wow, that's a new product. I'd like to get it,\" and they add other products to it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I wanted to start on the organic growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. You were running 6% or so, the last -- the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. You jumped up to approaching 12% here in Q4, almost double the growth rate. Anything in particular that's behind that? And any sense on how sustainable that kind of a growth rate is going forward?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Yes, I know -- I don't know. I think -- we have been -- you and I have talked about this many times. I mean, the Tools Group numbers, like you say, 11.8%, 6.0%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5%. In fact, the Tools Group now -- the Tools Group has now grown greater -- 5% or greater in, I think, the number 18 of the last 19 quarters. So they've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David -- what I can say first, in general, is that what's happening here is the effect -- the continually increasing effect of understanding how to help the franchisees be more effective, which authored things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow van. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in the -- for the customer needs that excite the customers and get that stuff moving off the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more productive and effective and the experience that's building in our team to be able to wield this model, which has always been, I've said, the model that fell from Saturn, more effectively. One of the world's great models, those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding it better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season, like Liam just add, that's one. And two, we had things like power tools and some great power tool products that came up. I was in a shop the other day, and in fact, Monday -- Tuesday -- sorry, Tuesday, I was in a shop and the technician said, \"Boy, I got this new CT8850, you know, my cordless impact. I used to use these pneumatics. I used to be proud of my pneumatic. Now I've turned my compressor off because this thing is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand.\" So that was a terrific endorsement of that. He really had gone completely to that new product, and that has driven some of our sales. So you see that. The other thing about the fourth quarter is, we had a particularly great SFC, great SFC. And the tool -- again, this is the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this. They're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things that I feel about this business, if I can just say this. I think we are on a trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers there on -- you can see it in our numbers. In the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see the K, you'll see a couple of million dollars of profitability hit associated with it. And you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But we're exposed in places like -- our big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and then another 5% in the Canada and so on. And we have some drips and drabs around Australia and Japan. But when you -- and the actual number depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is that as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unfavorable. So we'll see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the arithmetic associated with the currency. So things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical industries, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits, those will continue to grow. And we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 than when we entered.", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up on that. If we look at these activities that you're doing with your dealers to improve their productivity, finding ways to push more through the channel, inherently that's somewhat of a barrier. You are creating more and more of a barrier of entry. How is your competition competing with your franchisees changing their business? Are they trying to figure it out? Are they copying what you're doing? What's happening down in the trenches there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well, we have some great guys in the competition. We have some great companies, Stanley and Danaher behind Matco and so on. But at the garage level in the vans, from each of our positions, we see that our franchisees don't often mention the competitors. They reference themselves versus where we have been or where we are going. I just did a van ride, like I said, on Tuesday. And my van driver never mentioned the competitors. He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this. And I see it across our product line. Our people are confident of our hand tools. Our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And you know what's happening in the marketplace now, it used to be garages wanted diagnostics. Well with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these days. And so you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees. And yes, they say, \"Well, I'd rather have this or I need something else.\" But it's always with reference to themselves, it's not much compared to their -- it's not really compared to their competition as much. I hardly ever hear about that. That's not to say, they're not capable and capable people and aggressive people, but when I go out, I hear mostly about ourselves.", "Operator", "Our last question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "You and your organization have built a tremendous compound earnings growth story here, and it's-- it really shows. So congrats on all the progress. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions that are just kind of following up on the earlier questions. And I start with the Tools Group. And you made the observation that you aren't adding any more vans, I guess, on the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express. Just looking at the 17.5% origination growth in the finance portfolio suggests that the storage is still a big part of the Tools growth story and the margin, 200 basis points, probably is driven in part by that as well. How do you keep the growth going if you've stopped opening new stores in this enterprise? And maybe talk to that, for starters.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "Well let me say a couple of things. First, just thanks for your compliments about compound earnings growth. But actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and runway further. So we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge. But you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is, we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage unit at the kickoffs, David. And you know what it is? It's a tool storage. It's these tool storage, big boxes, you can envision them, and they're gleaming in different colors. They've got great features. You can plug in your power tools and all this stuff, and now we equip them with a downtown sound bar. Now I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar in a tool storage box sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody who sees them and hears them is going crazy. So new product is a great -- are a great advantage, so that helps it, too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep thinking of new ways. The Rock 'N Roll Cab was an innovation by the -- brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help the van -- virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas. That doesn't mean that the Rock 'N Roll Cabs won't contribute more. I mean, they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have been, like, year-over-year -- if you wanted to look at last year at this time, North America had 56 vans, now we have 59. So they only moved up 3 and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage and big ticket was above that. So they figured out some way to do it without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also -- we'll be tasking them to come up with new ideas to try to help this situation. The final point is that when you look at the originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations and it does -- it is driven by big-ticket items, but it's also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees' sales, of course. The originations track a sale to a technician; our sales track a sale from us to the franchisee. So there's a little bit of timing difference, and it can muddy the water a little bit.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "That's good detail. I guess, the second question I had was, again, following up on a previous question on competition, and you talked about with respect to Stanley and Matco and the others. I wonder if you could just talk about how much competition you're feeling and maybe particularly within the diagnostics business. But how much competition you're feeling from the automotive retailers? And I guess the question really is, as the category...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "What do you mean? What do you mean automotive retailers? Can you define it for me?", "David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, the AutoZone, Pep Boys, O'Reilly, those guys. I guess my question really is, as that diagnostics category evolves and the technologies that represent, kind of, the foundation of that category become less expensive, how do you respond to protect your great business from price competition, increasing availability? I mean, is it innovation? Is it warranties? Is it credit? Is it support and service? How do you go about...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk", "I'll tell you what, I tell you what, all of the above, I think. Remember first -- I think, first, that we start with a great product enabled by an extraordinary base of information with, I think, better insight on repair than anybody else. We have a product that will tell you, okay, if you have a make and model and powertrain of a car, and it's a certain model, what the typical repair is on that model based on big data. It's the only one available. And we have an understanding. A lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional tests, through its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what the OEM says as a standard fix. And then they want the whisper tips and the tips that come out of the big data. We have all of that. Almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be -- the computer content on cars are getting more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages, you need -- what used to be a situation where you needed one big unit to handle everybody and you could pass it around, well, you can't be working on a car today, in many cases, without these things. So every technician wants one. And so you have that. And then finally, finally, we have our franchisee armed with the TechKnow vans, up close and personal with the technician to help him through the product, tell him what he needs to know, how to use it, and find out what his particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those other guys. We think this is a robust market that's going to keep growing. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area. And we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software. And our software business -- our hardware business was strong. We just had a great launch. And our software business was up more than the hardware business in the quarter.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Kratcoski, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski", "Thanks, Hannah, and to everyone, we appreciate you joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly. And as always, we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Have a good day. Bye.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

Good day. And welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2015 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer.", "Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the Audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state -- management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I will give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "I believe that our first quarter once again provide a strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was a $1.87, up from a $1.62 last year, that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points.", "Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on consolidated operating margins to 20.1%, compared to the 18.6% registered last year.", "Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall, sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year and those gains include a significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points.", "Now currencies headwind, it was last year, it\u2019s likely to continue throughout the year and if the present rates hold, it will rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups.", "For us the quarters result a testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and of our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. Like in past quarters, the environment surrounding our Automotive Repair related businesses, the Tools Group and RS&I, Group was generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust.", "In that regard the Tools Group has enhanced our franchise network with van productivity and with innovative marketing taking clear advantage of the favorability to sell more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. At the same time, RS&I is also growing, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand repair shop owners and managers.", "Now C&I, serving customers in critical industries and the most international of our groups does face more variations in the market. Its European operations are confronted with large differences across the business from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence in the Middle East to the challenges of Russia to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia.", "But it\u2019s in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds and when combined with our growing range of customer driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building emerging markets.", "Besides advancements on our runways for growth, we also made progress on our runways for improvement with Snap-on value creation and safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI as we call it.", "RCI has become a part of the fabric, a daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results. OI margin is up and you can see it advance like our annual RCI conference held recently just down the road in Illinois, nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ides, buy for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and enthusiasm back home to the local teams.", "You can\u2019t help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. Well, that\u2019s the environment. Of course, as it will always. There are headwinds.", "Market-to-market variations in difficult macros, but despite the challenges our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you could see it throughout the numbers.", "Now let's move to the segments, in the C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8% with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million, increased $4.9 million or 12.5% and that represents our margin rate for C&I of 14.8%, an expansion of 130 basis points.", "SNA Europe again recorded volume growth. This time similar to that achieved by RCI -- by C&I overall, brought gains in many of our markets, led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and far those gains made from past restructuring.", "Our initiative to improve productivity with focus on both costs and product development are clearly evident in the operations achievements and you can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up, but profits, profits were up more. Illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged.", "Industrial division was also part of the C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries, areas like power generation, mining, railroads and the military, as everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we have made the most of the opportunities available, this time the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops are redeployed back to the allied states. Actually, that\u2019s a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise mid to turbulence.", "Another big factor and again in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One new example in the recent quarter was the with the PDX series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry, made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, these pneumatic drills are using application ranging from light assembly to metalwork, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metal, plastics and composite materials, the kind of versatility that\u2019s so helpful in aviation application. And the feeterrable trigger provides outstanding control and unparallel run out performance offering great accuracy.", "Beside utility of the tool, the low sound, low vibration, soft grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue. Another attractive feature in the workplace to ease the professional\u2019s task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are especially usual.", "One performing important repair work on damaged aircraft still, an application that must be critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner, the PDX drill, a Superior Aviation tool consistent with Snap-on name.", "Our industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging the Snap-on RCI experience. Participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on customer\u2019s side, side-by-side with the customer\u2019s local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and insight of rapid continuous, improving, helping customers solve their problems but all the -- problem -- but all the while, gaining deeper practical understanding of the crucial task in critical industries, creating opportunities to tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales.", "We say we help professionals in solving the critical, RCI is becoming a tool to do just that. Our Asia-Pacific division also posted higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there, attending our annual reseller\u2019s conference this year within C&I in China, bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associates and resellers from all across the region. New Asian-ized products were introduced. Training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia-Pacific. That\u2019s C&I.", "Now on with the Tools Group. Organic sales up 12.9%, solid grow in all geographies. The groups operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points for the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel and there is abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel.", "It is stated clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical and poor indicators of network health likes sales per band and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely and they are favorable across the board.", "In our direct interactions with the franchisees, the meetings like 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year. They were marked by -- I can tell you they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism by commitment and energy, gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals confident in reaching higher. Our Snap-on value creation process, the process is also critical components of the Tools Group progress.", "Innovative new products, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group\u2019s upward trajectory. An example is the KRL1163 Tool Storage Cab with the power tool organizer system based on customer connections made on our Rock N Roll Express bands. This model transforms the bottom drawer of the box into a customized secure, easy to access storage system for frequently used power tools.", "It\u2019s a feature that can make technicians work easier. Visitors to our Rock N Roll Cab highlighted the need, our design teams made it a reality, customer connection to innovation to winning product.", "Speaking of tool storage, this summer marks our 95th year in business. We\u2019ve just launched a special set of tool storage box, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panel and custom red trim etched with the years, 1920 and 2015.", "The new units also offer the Snap-on echo remote locking system, another customer connection driven option that we\u2019re confident will be quite popular. These special anniversary boxes are already gathering -- generating considerable excitement on the advance and in the shops. Lots of excitement around these blocks.", "And we believe there will be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and on the bond between Snap-on and professionals. More innovation can be seen on product like the new Snap-on half inch drive 3 six-inch breaker bar, the SHN-36 originally developed from customer connections of the heavy duty mechanics desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of a soft grip provides added control on comfort and that\u2019s a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment, a loosening head bolts on large engine, a much improved product that will make work easier, innovation even on the most established product line.", "Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group efforts with RCI. Progress, I think, it\u2019s clearly evident in the financials but to double down on a testimony, I spoke before of our annual RCI conference. While a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that at Snap-on. The shop floor has no monopoly on RCI. And illustrating that even an experienced organization like the Tools Group potential RCI opportunities abound up and down throughout and across the business.", "And we can\u2019t talk about the Tools Group without speaking of its strategic partner about our financial services organization. With each quarters Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned just what programs can best aid our franchisees. And the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly portfolio growth, profits up over 70% and all the while holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, a greatest historic tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trend.", "Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, broad gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. I\u2019ve spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units and they continue to drive growth and excitement in the independent repair space. And the first quarter was no exception with our VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s ultra unit being recognized by undercar digest in this year\u2019s list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication.", "Undercar digest bases its selection on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics resonate strongly with professionals. And it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solutions. That\u2019s what these stools are about.", "The VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s Ultra, they are also key components of our next generation advanced diagnostic work stations, launched in February. These new work stations include handheld diagnostic unit in docking station, a flat screen monitor and accustomed Snap-on tool box. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support to fix cars accurately and quickly and they go a long way in reinforcing the shops images having strong professional capability in the electronics arena, a feature we believe is of significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology.", "With more than 800 workstation sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products with over $1 million in first year sales. And it\u2019s another add to our growing track record of innovation success and it\u2019s driving sales progress.", "Our equipment division also registered gains in the quarter with several national account in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including challenger lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes as well as the new undercar equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on equipment increased productivity for the automotive repair shop networks and advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products.", "Finally, we continue to see further progress with our Nexiq heavy-duty and fleet information systems, as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in Mitchell1\u2019s ProDemand and SureTrack products. All are differentiating offerings that lead to more business.", "Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multi-location customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on innovates in the information products, unique database solution, effective navigation systems with speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength in vehicle information and they helped drive RS&I sales again this quarter. So that\u2019s the highlights.", "Significant progress was made in the quarter. Organic sales rise 9.9%, along all our runways for coherent growth. EPS of a $1.87, up 15.4%. Gains achieved through our Snap-on value creation processes, RCI and customer connections especially shinning through, strengthening our business and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On a reported basis, net sales including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels.", "As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations. Largely due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points.", "Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring costs and savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first three months of 2015.", "Last year, we incurred $2 million dollars of restructuring costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $16.2 million from prior year levels and as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%.", "Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $178.2 million in the quarter, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $22.1 million or 14.2%. And the operating margin of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 18.6% the year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 32%, compared with 31.6% last year.", "Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or a $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results, starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business.", "Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives primarily in Europe.", "Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million and the operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to sales volume leverage.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for C&I segment of $44 million including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels and the operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points.", "Turning now to slide eight. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations.", "Gross profit of a $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume related expenses.", "The operating expense margin of 28.2% improved 60 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $10.6 million and the operating margin of 15.8% improved 150 basis points.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group showed on slide nine. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.", "Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels and gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring costs.", "Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter and operating expense margin of 23.3% increased 50 basis points, largely due to operating expenses of Pro-Cut, which was acquired in May of last year.", "First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $63.9 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.8 million or 10% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.5% improved 140 basis points.", "Now turning to slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million, compared with operating earnings of $34.4 million on revenue of $50.2 million last year.", "The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter, compared with 17.5% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels.", "Moving to slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution as well as higher tax related payments in the current year. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year.", "Turning to slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $6.8 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million, and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations, and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end.", "In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter-end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now, I will turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. As our first quarter similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement, EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies, and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most of the opportunities. We made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers, enhance the band channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%. And we believe the network has never been stronger, expand with repair shop owners and managers, RS&I organic sales up 6.3%.", "OEM, dealerships, and independent shops capturing new customers with the growing product bundle, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. C&I organics sales up 9.8%, SNA Europe progressing against the economic tied, our critical industry team building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position.", "Once again, again this quarter we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on value creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than a 100 basis point in every group and an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.", "We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony that our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity, and our teams have the capability to continue to trend positive progress as we move forward even amid headwind.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, it\u2019s appropriate that I mention our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening today. The encouraging performance of the first quarter and the positive trends are continuing due to your contribution and commitment. For the result you\u2019ve authored, you have my congratulations and for your dedication and support to our team, have my thanks.", "Now, I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.", "Tom Hayes", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, Tom.", "Tom Hayes", "Just wondering specifically on the C&I Group great organic growth. I was just wondering if there are any industries that maybe outperformed your expectations. And then correlated to that, just wondering about your exposure maybe to oil and gas market as they kind of have some challenges right now?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes. Look, I expect good news in every market, every quarter I think because we are not -- thing is we are in early days in penetrating critical industry. It\u2019s an aspect of coherent growth that what we\u2019re doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We are doing it for other people and other industries you know observing work and making it easier with just the right tools, whether it\u2019s software or hardware.", "And so an element of that is learning about the industry. So it\u2019s early days. Now we have very industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don\u2019t really have much [indiscernible] in the way of share in these businesses. So therefore each quarter rise and falls not so much on the effect of the industry, just on our own performance.", "So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places like I said in my power generation, mining, railroad, the military. The military was up this time because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area. And oil and gas actually was up, even slightly in this quarter.", "So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation, but the critical industry business really is the driver behind C&I and you see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn\u2019t see any particular surprises. I guess if you are looking at our business, you might say, ghee, they grew in oil and gas, even though the market was weak. My view was we don\u2019t have that biggest share in oil and gas. Therefore, we can grow against weak markets.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Just one kind of follow-up question. I was just wondering on the -- how much share repurchase authorization you still have?", "Aldo Pagliari", "We\u2019re having about $215 million.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. Thank you for the questions.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good morning, Nick.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, Liam. How are you doing?", "Liam Burke", "I am fine. Thanks. The organic growth of the Snap-on Tool segment is pretty strong, closer to the high-single digits. A lot higher than more of a mid-single digit expectation, what's driving that incremental growth?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think what\u2019s driving it is, is that the Tools Group team is understanding how to enable the franchisees that we have in various places. We have 4,800 worldwide. We have 3,478, I think in the United States are van. And they are learning quarter-by-quarter how to do it better. And that\u2019s allowing to sell more to same customers and reach other customers, which they had on their routes but they hadn\u2019t been calling on.", "So the effects of these, I think maybe threefold. One effect is I think we\u2019ve talked about it many times. I think they\u2019re very cleverly breaking through the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with a Rock N' Roll Cabs and you can see it in the progression of the tool storage and breaking through the time by adding a help with things like the TechKnow vans.", "Now I think, we have 66, 67 of Rock N' Roll -- 66 Rock N' Roll vans throughout the world now and we have now up to 35 TechKnow vans, that\u2019s about four since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that natural boundary is helping. Secondly, Boy, we\u2019re using as much as possible.", "We using as much as possible our customer connection. We spent a lot of time in the shops and we\u2019re organizing that process and getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products, like that 36-Inch Breaker Bar. People might look at that and say, what\u2019s that? It\u2019s just a long bar.", "But the idea was -- it wasn\u2019t really available in the marketplace and the ones that were available aren\u2019t as comfortable. Innovation doesn\u2019t have to be earth shattering. It just has to make work easier in this space and the Tools Group is understanding how to do that. ", "And then thirdly, they\u2019re looking at the franchisee and saying, we know your time is valuable. We\u2019re going to make it better. We\u2019re going to drive RCI into the vans and that\u2019s all resulting in this kind of thing. Their numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter, 12.9% in the quarter, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6% before that.", "In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they\u2019ve been 6% or above. And that\u2019s -- what\u2019s driving it all is tuning that business. It\u2019s kind of a -- if you step back and you look at the auto repair you would say, it\u2019s going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is what we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you would see these kinds of numbers.", "Liam Burke", "And you touched on RCI across all businesses. They were providing incremental profitability along with volume increases. Can you push RCI in a similar fashion to the van channel?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re putting RCI into the vans drivers. Now, things like -- I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before on the corporate things like when you repair a ratchet, repairing a ratchet was taking 15 minutes every ratchet. Sometimes, I was on vans where people brought on four ratchets to be repaired at one stop that would have killed the route that day.", "But we have tools, kind of just like a factory. We are laying it out like a factory, like our van drivers can repair within three or four minutes now and number of things like that, so taking RCI, looking at the van, doing value stream mapping on the van and reducing the time. Adding to their selling time is part of the process, which is allowing them to reach out to more customers. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. Thanks for that question.", "Liam Burke", "Thanks Nick.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.", "Joe Vruwink", "Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Hi Joe.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Vruwink", "Maybe staying with the Tools Group for a second, any products in the catalogue that\u2019s become kind of logical extensions of this recent company-owned van strategy? I should say\u2026.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t feel so. I think -- not any particular product. I don't think -- I'm sure I could go through launching of new products and find those that came from a company-owned store driver but only around customer connection. We have the van driver itself is the guy or an employee goes out there and he reports back as part and he gives us leads for new tool as part of the company-owned store and that flows back. But we don't really differentiate between a lead from a company-owned store and a franchisees.", "But in my remarks, you might have heard the whole idea of the power tool draw organizer at the bottom -- at the tool storage box. That came from the Rock 'N Roll Cab and their company stores. They are not selling but their company stores are rolling there. People got on those Rock 'N Roll Cabs and they start talking about boy, wouldn\u2019t it be good if we had a power tool organizer at the bottom in one of these drawers.", "We got that idea. We gave it to the engineers, they put it in place and we\u2019re rolling out this new product and it\u2019s looking to be a good seller. So that\u2019s an example. I guess the only thing is if you have the company owned stores, they just add the flow of ideas back from the field, the customer connection that comes back from the field.", "Joe Vruwink", "Yeah. So I guess, my question was more oriented towards the Rock 'N Roll Cab and the TechKnow van put really a spotlight on particular things. Is there some extension of that strategy that you can keep rolling out across the Tools Group?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, we only have 35 TechKnow vans now. We actually added a couple Rock 'N Roll Cabs in the last quarter, so that\u2019s growing much more slowly. But we added four TechKnow vans, so they may continue to grow some. Whether we add another extension, we may have some ideas but I don't think I'm going to pre-announce them on the call here. I think that\u2019s the magic and the magicians are trying to find out more techniques and activities or programs that would expand the power of the franchisee.", "See, I think, one of the things, Joe, I just want to point out. Part of the -- really what the Tools Group has done is they figured out that these vans, these franchisee are a great resource, they are better then anybody else. And they figured out how to help them, be more powerful and amplify that power of that rolling retail space and that really capable and committed entrepreneur that's driving it. And we\u2019re going to do more of that, but I\u2019m not about to announce any more of that.", "Joe Vruwink", "Okay. Fair enough. And then switching gears over to the profitability and RS&I this quarter. You call out a few product areas that I would normally think are a bit lower margin within that segment, yet the margins improved year-over-year. Has RCI kind of neutralized thinking about that business in terms of software being sold or equipment being sold from an EBIT margin standpoint?", "Nick Pinchuk", "As I said many times in these calls, our RS&I is the hardest to characterize from a margin perspective. Yes, we had good growth in things like equipments, which tends to be lower margin. But you know, we had a good quarter in software that offset it.", "Our software is rolling. When I go out and talk to people, they love our diagnostics. In many cases, they\u2019re solving problems three or four times faster than anybody else -- three to four times faster than anybody else and the software is up. So that\u2019s good stuff.", "Our Mitchell1 Information business and our Diagnostics and Independent Garages are pretty robust. And okay, equipments growing, but those two things are relatively imbalanced. So I don't think we saw a lot of mix in those numbers except for maybe the acquisition might have been there a little.", "Now the story of 140 basis points in, I think its 140 basis points in RS&I is we had about 50 and 60 of RCI, and we had \u2013 I think we had 70 or 80 of restructuring because last year we had a big restructuring dial up in there. So that\u2019s how you can kind of way you look at that. But still a pretty big dial up of RCI, plus you don\u2019t want to no mistake about this even though the equipment the lower margin business are growing so as the software.", "Joe Vruwink", "Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino", "Good morning, everybody.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Hi, Garry.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Hi, Garry.", "Gary Prestopino", "Good. All right. Nick, it\u2019s the inevitable question on margins and just looking at the gross margin, I think that gross margin you reported in Q1 was probably the highest that it\u2019s been for quite some time? And I was just wondering if there were something in there that got it about 49% or is -- one time deal or are we at a new kind of sustainable level here, so if you could directly you could talk about that?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yeah. Look, I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t spend a lot of time agonizing over the difference between gross margin and OE, I kind of test the operations to drive their operating income and I tend to focus on that much more.", "And what we said is, is that, we believe that we have both run ways for growth and improvement that accrues operating income and from quarter-to-quarter they accrue, those two things accrue in different proportion between gross margin and operating expense.", "So I wouldn\u2019t call the gross margin necessarily breakthrough, but there\u2019s nothing special in there this quarter. So there is nothing really -- there\u2019s no real -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real onetime event or anything like that.", "Really I mean you saw you saw our currency numbers in the quarter I think you, our sales were -- what was it 38.5% in currency and about 6.9% in OI and we are -- we have currency headwinds one of the current rate stays the same those will rise.", "But on the other hand we believe that that's sort of arithmetic, well, we are so enthusiastic about our operating opportunities and you can see it in this quarter the operating opportunities worked out. Currencies are going to go up and down, but the operating gains are going to stay with us forever and we view the 16.7% as being part of that.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. That's fair. And then Europe I\u2019ve been reading that new car registrations are up? It seems that Europe starting to get some traction? And I think you said your European hand tools business topline was up commensurate with C&I? So -- the cadence has been that you\u2019ve moved on a quarterly basis over the last couple of quarters from low single-digit to mid single-digit to high single-digit growth in the\u2026", "Nick Pinchuk", "It hasn\u2019t been that -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that thinking about it back here, I have to go back and look it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that sort of straight lines, but if you looked that it over say like eight quarters or something like that you probably see some kind of movement.", "I think what happens this order is basically some of our activities are paying off associated with new product development. We do have some new products that are exciting the customers you can create enthusiasm even in what I consider to be a relatively dead market in Europe.", "New car sales usually doesn\u2019t help us that much, except for the fact that, except for the broader fact that new car sales probably accompanying a more positive economy. It is true though that we made -- I think encouraging gains in selling in Europe.", "We -- France and Germany which had been a drag in the last couple of quarters. In fact they were down in the last couple of quarters, they were up this quarter and we continued with the Nordic countries and we had some business in Turkey, of course, Eastern Europe was week, so and Spain was up off of a relatively low base.", "So we kind of saw -- we kind of saw the same progress in Europe that we\u2019ve seen in other quarters, except we started making progress in France and Germany. Eastern Europe is kind of dead right now and Russia is difficult so on. So that\u2019s kind of -- so I guess you could be entitled for the idea, Europe got a somewhat better. But profits were even better, very strong performance because of the effects of RCI.", "Gary Prestopino", "That's great news. And then lastly, as I just look at this, the reported revenues and the unfavourable currency translation, if I add back the impact of currency translation and then say you had about 25% of your sales are based internationally. Is that correct?", "Nick Pinchuk", "A little more than that. I think it\u2019s -- let me see I think it\u2019s about, what is it like 35%, yes 35% is international.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. Because I was getting -- I was getting a currency hit of somewhere between 17% drag on the numbers from a 25% contributions, so it\u2019s 35%, it\u2019s still going to be about 10% to 12% hit. And I am just wondering were the -- was the euro down that much that it caused that kind of drag on the numbers, or is my math wrong?", "Nick Pinchuk", "The euro was down. We have several currencies that impact us on a translation basis. You\u2019ve got -- first of all, you got the euro and then you got the pound and then you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar. If you look at that and actually when I said 35%, it\u2019s -- I was embracing our northern neighbours here and I was using Canada. If you just look at the United States, talk about, maybe think of Canada, it\u2019s international which is somehow I don\u2019t really always, it\u2019s 40% outside the United States, so Canada is in there. So you see those kinds of variations.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I mean, basically, one of those companies that is in current -- we are affected by currency, but we have some good -- some reasonable natural hedges from transaction because we tend to make in the markets where we sell.", "Gary Prestopino", "Right. That's the next question I was going to get to. You have those natural hedges, so...", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, not in everything, but we are not immune. Certain like this we are currency resistant from a transaction point of view, but we are not immune. So we don\u2019t bring our hands over it. We see it coming like I said clearly we had currency -- we had currency last year actually. We\u2019ve got it this year. If the rates stay where they or rise some, but it doesn\u2019t affect our operating activity because we know that that 16.7% is going to stay with us, that 12.9% is going to stay with us, that 9.8% is going to stay with us.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard Hilgert", "Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Good morning, Richard.", "Richard Hilgert", "I was looking at the currency impact a little bit differently. I added back the currency impacts to each one of the revenues for each of the groups, and then also added back the negative impact for currency for each one of their operating results.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes.", "Richard Hilgert", "The year-over-year increase or expansion in margin, excluding currency, was 140 basis points. When I did all those add backs, I came up with an expansion that was just about 10 basis points less than that at about 130, which is still a fantastic performance. But I'm curious, is that because -- correct me if I am wrong, but isn\u2019t C&I a little bit more of the mix when you add back the currencies and that's why the expansion wasn't quite as much when you take into consideration the currency?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019ll tell you this is that in our numbers 120 basis points for our calculation, no effective currency in that 120. In other words, it all balances out at the corporate level. At the corporate level, it all balances out. So we don't really -- at a margin level, at a margin rate level. So the 16.7% from our perspective is basically all RCI, it\u2019s pretty much \u2013 it\u2019s got bad news from pension, it\u2019s got bad news from pension and so on, and it\u2019s primarily RCI and volume productivity.", "Richard Hilgert", "Yes. No matter how you slice it, it\u2019s still a great performance.", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s got a little bit of restructuring good news, offsetting pension and the rest is productivity, currency doesn\u2019t come in there. But if you go by the various groups, C&I it\u2019s helped a little bit on the margin rate basis, not on an absolute basis by currency. Tools Group being, Tools Group would -- if they didn\u2019t have currency, Tools Group would be much more -- it would have been more than 150 basis points. And our C&I a little bit of currency. But that\u2019s way it kind of works out.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. And then on the hand tools side, since we\u2019ve had improving economic conditions for the last three, four years now, have you see an increase in the number of garages opening up in the United States. Is that all sold out?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No. Technician population is probably growing at about 1.3% for government work that would be the number. But the garages, in fact, if anything, if anything actually, depending how far back you go, the dealerships have shrunk. I think the dealerships were about 21,000 before recession, now that it\u2019s 17 or 18. So they have shrunk. The independents have stayed about the same. The independent have taken more share since that\u2019s started before the recession.", "That seems to may be, now this state always trail. So that\u2019s kind of levelled off a lot of people think now. But I think there hasn\u2019t been a big change in the characteristics, except the independents are becoming more sophisticated, because they have the deal with the changing technologies. 20 years ago there were 50 engines codes on a car, now there is 5,000 engine codes. It\u2019s hard to fix the car without the diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we are selling them to technicians now, not just the garages and so that\u2019s helping drive our business.", "So that technology change in the independent space, that\u2019s why we talked about the diagnostic workstation because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days. And they want to bring them to people who could fix and therefore this diagnostic unit makes it look like wow, this is big computer unit that can fix the car, helps fix the car and it grows confidence. And actually, it helps in terms of accuracy. So, if anything, we\u2019re seeing a greater demand of our product in the independent shops and other shops because of the change in technology, that\u2019s\u2019 the big change.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. Great. And then with respect to your comments about Europe and new car sales in what that means, in terms of hand tool sales over there. Just noticing Western Europe trailing 12 months, new car sales are up about 6%, Eastern Europe however, those, is up about 10%. They were up as much as 15% back about, around the third quarter of last year.", "But that growth rate is kind of steadily got down a bit. They are still tracking year-over-year increases. So I\u2019m kind of curious, it makes sense that France and Germany, you\u2019re doing better. The industry is doing better in general in those two countries. But I'm surprised that the Eastern Europe hasn\u2019t really kept up with the expansion of the new-car demand, any comments about that?", "Nick Pinchuk", "The new car demand is down in Eastern Europe, right.", "Richard Hilgert", "No. I mean, it\u2019s still up.", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s still up. But for us new cars don\u2019t matter. I mean, I think, I\u2019ve said that, because the new car sales are almost always -- except in emerging markets place like China and India so on. There is almost always small compared to the installed base to the car part. Consider the U.S. $16 million cars, North America, 17 million 18 million cars sold. There is a 300 million on the road. It\u2019s like a fly spec almost, the new cars, compared to those on the roads So doesn\u2019t really move our business that much up and down and sort of a shortly basis.", "In terms of Eastern Europe, I think, I would just suggest you that I'm not really sure what\u2019s going on in the Eastern Europe, it\u2019s a cocktail of different countries. So it\u2019s really hard to say, I mean, you see Russia being so weak. On the other hand, our business is up in Poland, for example, if you include that in Eastern Europe.", "Richard Hilgert", "Yeah. I do.", "Nick Pinchuk", "So it\u2019s hard to make much prediction about that. I think this is just one of those turbulent things that where traditional economics don't always work in every period.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. And just for clarification on new car sales, it would impact you from the perspective of the new diagnostics in the new tools that have to come out of the service new vehicle, right?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "But that\u2019s a longer wave event. In other words, you\u2019re right, Richard, but the next year isn\u2019t that much different. It changes some, and so people need to adjust for that. But these things work through over time. I was reacting to the idea that people say while new car sales were up in the first quarter therefore your business is going to be better. I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t affect us that much.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay.", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s much longer.", "Richard Hilgert", "And the last question for Aldo. The financial services business, the receivables debt year-over-year keeps growing at the low double-digit numbers, despite the lower revenue on the single-digit numbers. Any comments on how come we\u2019re still seeing so much more growth, I thought that the financial services business was pretty much penetrated for being a captive now?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Richard, just to remind you, most of the activity in financial services actually about 94% to 95% of, it really reflects activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. So if you look at on Snap-on Tools Group performance, again it was, I think, organically 12 plus percent, 12.9%. And I think, what you\u2019re seeing when you look at the originations of 14.2 on the topline for full year growth, you seeing it really reflective of the Tools Group and the Financial Services penetration of their sale of not just big-ticket items, but a variety of the product that they sell. So overtime it will mirror that and I think if you look back, it\u2019s rather consistent with Tools Groups performance over the last several quarters.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. Are they doing more in RS&I at this point?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Above the same level. I mean, we are growing with RS&I at about the same level. The biggest different has been the reflection of the Tools Group.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thank you.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Take care.", "Operator", "And there are no more questions over the phone. So at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our host for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Great. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway; headway in our efforts to extend into critical industries, in our European business, and in several emerging markets. That progress was one against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military has been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experience for Snap-on, another strong period, up double-digits from last year.", "However, we do remain cautious on the military business there. This is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure, make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence.

And there were some very positive volume gains.", "SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending to critical industries. Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for breaking predictability and effectiveness.

And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia-Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth. Activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia.

And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group.", "In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double-digits and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor, big ticket gains were also propelled by new two storage products; winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tools storage systems.

Technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year, and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shops all around the world.", "Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services on Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases.

It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, higher resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability, and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes; a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complaint, all of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity.

Good morning, everyone. Congratulations Nick on a great quarter.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks. Thank you.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess I'm struck by the slow originations growth, up 8.9%, and what looks like divergence against a double-digit growth in big ticket. And I'm mindful that credit typically exists on the sell-through. Is it possible that your franchisees are just seeing a much higher level of inventory right now and that would have explained that divergence or maybe you could help us understand that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "There's a lot of vintage in that. Fundamentally, there is questions of timings, there is a secondary market that comes into that, there is the questions of the how much \u2013 what are those actually sold at versus what we sell, what sales price we book versus what the van driver books. The numbers are something like this, I think they're \u2013 what were they, 8.9% this quarter?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "And originations in 11.2%. But last quarter, they were reverse, it was 14.2% versus 12.9%. And the quarter before that it was \u2013 in other words, 14.2% was the originations and 12.9% was the Tools Group, and 7.5% (36:16) was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group. So they don't match up perfectly. We are unconcerned \u2013 we're not concerned about anything like that. And we don't see anything like buildup of inventory in the vans at all. This is just a matter of timing and the differences I pointed out.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And that big ticket growth, you were talking about the double-digit growth. Is there any way you can help us understand the difference between price mix growth versus volume growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "You mean \u2013 well, I think \u2013 look, the big ticket items are \u2013 you mean, in terms of big ticket growth itself or the effect on Tools?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. No, the big ticket growth. I'm just trying to understand how much of that was from \u2013 I'm presuming you're talking about revenue growth and I'm just wondering how much of that...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah. No, if you're talking about revenue growth. Generally, big ticket prices are \u2013 when we're talking about \u2013 when I talk about big ticket growth, I'm talking about what the big ticket items were a year ago, and they've grown actually at double-digits, a little faster than the Tools Group. And, in fact, that's, I would say, apples-to-apples in terms of pricing. So it's pretty much volume growth in that situation.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Volume growth. Okay. And then last question, just \u2013 there's been a lot of talk about competition within the diagnostic space and there's been a lot of evolution lately in terms of how people are going to market the value prop and how it's packaged. Are you feeling the increased presence of competitive product in the market? That might explain the lower organic growth rates in RS&I or how should we think about that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't think so. I mean, first of all, it's one quarter; that's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business \u2013 the sale of diagnostics and our information products into independent repair shops, which is the space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits. So \u2013 mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then second thing is, I would offer that \u2013 I was just on these Rock N' Roll \u2013 I was on one of these techno vans recently. And the van driver told me, he said, we're not associated \u2013 we're not worried about competition, our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see \u2013 I was just with 1,200 customers over the weekend and that \u2013 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product and basically they talked about the idea that it was better than anything else we had \u2013 better than anything else we had brought out.", "Secondly \u2013 I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you \u2013 when we survey independent technicians, when we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers, the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for number two. So you see all those. Now, if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was RS&I; I personally think, we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe.", "So ironically, equipment business was \u2013 grew, I think Aldo said, low single-digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view, but from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400, hey, that's a great product and it's selling very well and it's a great margin generator for us.", "So what you saw from an equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins, because of the aligner business, because it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more.", "But we don't see, actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market. So logically or at least in talking to market we don't see much pressure and then empirically, we don't see it in our numbers as pressure either.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Is there any way you can size for us the size of the Eastern European undercar business as a percentage?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't think I want to get into that granularity, but...", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Sure.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "...but I can just say that that business is bigger for equipment -bigger than for equipment than anybody else, because \u2013 and it becomes a historical thing. We made better inroads in Eastern Europe and the Middle East than almost any of our other businesses. And so it has been particularly impacted by this particular downturn and in this particular set of economic dynamics. Now, we have other \u2013 we're not mourning or wringing our hands over that, but when you start slicing the corporation down into pieces, that you start to see it a little bit more like it comes out in RS&I.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much. Great quarter.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Hi, Joe.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Hello, Joe.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Sticking with diagnostics, Nick, when you originally started throwing out a gross target for that segment and thinking it would grow kind of near to 5% rate. I believe the strategy at that time was to sell a diagnostics unit to a repair shop, and now you're talking about selling diagnostics units to each technician within that shop. And so how might that change maybe the longer-term growth profile for the business knowing the evolution of that strategy?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, first of all, I'm not abandoning the idea we're selling for the shops. I think we still have a lot of runway in terms of, what I would call, the downtown diagnostics, the things that will stand up and tell your fortune, the higher level ones that a shop would buy and might have one or two of them in the shop. We still have a lot of runway in that area, so \u2013 and it's a very important product line for us. And, in fact, we feel pretty positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity, but I think what you say is very true.", "We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly on the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today, and the new cars 80% of the repair. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace. And so maintenance techs as opposed to the repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes, and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics, those things. That's the purpose of the ETHOS Tech.", "So you would expect that that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, I would still say \u2013 let's not talk of 4% to 6%, I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over the horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity.", "If you look at \u2013 I would say, this particular one sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wield that model better and better reach more technicians, but at the end of the day, it is bounded. So I'd put them in those pieces. Now maybe you might (43:58) between the 4% to 6% number, but I \u2013 for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, in middle.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And I probably won't get you to update the range itself today. So I guess I can move on to my next question.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Really, what I'm saying \u2013 let me just try to clarify. When I said 4% to 6%, I meant generally we can grow at that level. If you want to look at the Tools Group, we said it'd be at the bottom. We can grow at that level, roughly double GDP, without necessarily coming up with things that would make our models more powerful. We could capture more customers, we could add more \u2013 no accelerators. Now, you see what happened in the Tools Group, we got accelerators on top of that breaking through the barriers of space and time.", "I was just on a techno \u2013 I just said I was on a techno van, we talked about that. We always \u2013 we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock N' Roll cab and the techno van save time for the franchisees, because when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple times a year, it's like a training seminar. Because the guy who's running the van is an incredible salesman, and it saves our franchisee from going to a training center \u2013 seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up, we not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6% 20 of the last 21 quarters, that's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Sure. Now, that's great color. Shifting gears a little bit, what's your experience around China before Snap-on and while at Snap-on? Is there anything going on in that region that gives you pause or areas of concern that you might be seeing just given your experience there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Look, China is \u2013 I would see China through Tiananmen. you got to remember. So I was there when \u2013 I remember going to the hotel, The Shanghai Hilton and I stayed there three days, I never saw another guest. And three months before that, it was like going to the gold rush. So you see a lot of variations in China, I think this is quite normal. You're seeing some variation, but nothing that would affect my view of the long-term trajectory. I see opportunities for us. The repair ways will rise, we will take advantage of it. The shape of that advantage, we have to figure out going forward; that's really our situation.", "Of course, Asia is now \u2013 I think it's correct and popular to say that Asia is varying and it is. You see variations in India, Modi isn't catching on quite a bit. You see Indonesia coming back actually. Japan is actually getting a little better. We had a pretty good \u2013 we had a reasonable quarter in Japan. Korea came back, even though MERS has given us some problem, we had a good quarter in Korea. So you have variations, but nothing that interdicts the long-term view. And I spend six weeks a year there.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And nothing \u2013 if the long-term in China is so positive, what about more the near-term, any risks or volatility?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, yeah \u2013 sure, there's volatility, but we're not looking for a meltdown, that kind of thing, there's volatility. There is volatility in China of course. We have good \u2013 we have great quarters, we have medium quarters, those kinds of things. Our Asia-Pacific business, as Aldo said, they grew double-digits in a quarter. Okay?", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Liam Burke with Wunderlich.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Morning, Liam.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Morning.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Nick, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay on Asia-Pacific for a moment. You have had a fair amount of upfront investment there. It seems like you're getting growth. But in generally, directionally, are the margins you're getting out of the region or the direction of the trends, are they on track with expectations?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. Actually, we have no worry about, I think, the margins in that regard. I mean, it's the geography, it's the P&L geography. I think, you saw in Aldo's discussion again on C&I how \u2013 I think, gross margins were down 70 basis points and we made it up on SG&A, well it was SG&A up 170 basis points. And what's \u2013 the principle component of that was the geography of certain big players, and Asia-Pacific is one of them, lower gross margin, lower SG&A, but OI margin kind of on track for what we like to do, if you adjust for that forward investment. So we feel okay about that. I think we continue to be confident in that regard.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And staying with C&I, you mentioned power tools as being a driver of growth. Typically that's \u2013 is that unique to the quarter or is there something going on in the market where you're getting a step-up in demand there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't think it's anything in the market, I think it's \u2013 look \u2013 I think \u2013 actually, I think we hit a bonanza this quarter and you know what we did? We actually took power tools and garbed them in the 95th anniversary colors. And remember me talking about the box, how people like, signed up for this $10,000 box to put, in effect, a shrine to our corporation in the workplace. Well, if you offer it to them at a couple hundred dollars, they're even more enthusiastic.", "So part of what we're seeing there is this kind of push. We put the \u2013 our half inch pneumatic impact, which is a popular product, but we garbed it in the 95th anniversary or the cordless ratchet or our air hammers, things like that, or our cordless impact, and those have become popular. I don't think it's a special demand thing. I think power tools are kind of people \u2013 they wear out, people buy them periodically and it's like a new car, you show up with a new color and especially 95th anniversary colors for Snap-on is a collector item and it's a particularly compelling color. And so they like that.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Thank you, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "That's what's driving it.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hi. Good morning gentlemen.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Hi, Tom.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Morning, Tom.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Just wondering \u2013 staying on the C&I Group for a little bit, you called out, Nick, aviation and military doing well. I was just wondering if there's any segments that were lagging your expectations. And then just...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah...", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "...maybe just kind of a follow-up is, just kind of reset where you have the larger international exposure in the C&I Group?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. We had a good quarter \u2013 this happens every quarter. We have variations because we have six or seven critical industries in that area. This quarter, we happen to have a good \u2013 we had good progress in aviation, heavy duty \u2013 the heavy duty sector was strong for us, railroads were strong, oil and gas was weak. I think \u2013 but actually, I'm not so sure, last time it was up against the wind. And I think, for us, we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are, when you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter to quarter, that's the kind of thing we saw.", "We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But, generally, that's the \u2013 military was up double-digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep \u2013 the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going, to keep moving.", "Now, I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I \u2013 we feel very good right now about our Commercial & Industrial trajectory, we feel very good about our Tools trajectory, we feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory. But that's the trajectory \u2013 and without giving \u2013 I'm not warning anything or saying anything about \u2013 third quarter's always squirrely. I mean we have vacations in the third quarter and so on.", "So you can't tell what sectors will be going in and out, because we have our franchisees going on vacations sometimes usually in the third quarter, Europe is on vacation. So it's hard for me to predict it for every quarter. But I can tell you, we feel very encouraged by the trajectory. And I'm not in any way trying to say that we're going to have a tepid third quarter or anything like that.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay, great. And then just following up on the Tools Group, certainly there's a nice step up in operating margin both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Being relatively new to the story, I was just wondering if there is anything unique in the quarter kind of one time that moved it up or does it just reflect continued strong growth in the RCI and maybe new tool roll outs?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, it's all of those. Look, I think what's happened in the Tools Group is in the quarter \u2013 as you know, we focus on quarters, but the limited information \u2013 the limited indication of what's going on in the Tools Group though has been doing this for some time now. Like I said, the numbers are something like this, what, 11.2% this quarter organically, 12.9% the quarter before that, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6.2% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before.", "So they're kind of \u2013 they've been growing at 6% plus for, as I said, 20 of the last 22 quarters in effect almost defying GDP gravity. And so they're learning, they've learned. This management team has been in a while. They're learning how to wield this capable, tremendous model even better, things like the Rock N' Roll cab, the TechKnow Express, learning what products, learning the power of garbing the power tools into the 95th anniversary, figuring out how to do that, figuring out how to do \u2013 that's the things that are occurring. And that when you marry it up with RCI, that allows you to do these things more effectively, allows you to drive profitability upwards as well as volume.", "One other thing is that \u2013 I think I've said this is that \u2013 one of the things that works for us, kind of a tailwind in a way is that we're a company that has complex product offerings, 65,000 SKUs and we keep turning out more, because we try to solve everybody's \u2013 we try to solve a wide array of problems well the idea of modern technology, 3D printing, finite element analysis, X-ray diffractometers that allows you to look more accurately at the metallurgy, the kinds of things we get out of \u2013 more accurately getting the information out of customer connection into the mark \u2013 into our innovation process; those kind of things accrue with amplified advantage to somebody who has a complex product line, you're seeing some of that.", "Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Hey, Gary.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Good morning. A couple of quick questions. Your emerging markets business, Nick, I don't think I either quoted or you said it, but what was the growth there? And what's the percentage of sales now out of emerging markets?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "It's 10%. And the growth was \u2013 well, it depends if you talk about Eastern Europe as emerging markets, right. Eastern Europe.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Right. Okay, so I mean. Yeah, okay, if you want to roll that in, it ain't so good but the thing is Asia-Pacific grew double-digits. So you can look at it that way. I think \u2013 we actually have some businesses that weren't so bad in Eastern Europe, but, generally, it was an element of pain this period. And I \u2013 so I think you could call that an offset. Asia, okay. Asia, okay. Middle East, if you want to call that emerging market, that was kind of weak. South America was okay, Chile was up, Argentina was up. So you kind of got a balance there, a cocktail of things.", "So let me just summarize. Asia-Pacific double-digits. I think South America, the South \u2013 the Latin American countries, the bigger ones for us were up more \u2013 kind of double-digity type stuff. Eastern Europe tough, down. And Middle East, down. So that's where we are. And you roll it all up, when you classify something reasonably, a rational man would classify as emerging markets 10% of our business.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then, you \u2013 at times in the past you've talked that you try and do 40 plus products, new product introductions that generate over $1 million of sales. It just appears to be, from the last couple of calls that that number has increased. And could you comment on that?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Actually \u2013 go ahead, sorry.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "No, I was just going to add. I would assume that as newer cars proliferate, that is going to dictate to you \u2013 your company as to what new products you're going to come out with as the car part (57:39)?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I agree. You're right. Actually, I agree. I think we have great opportunities. And the thing I've said is, the way we measure the effectiveness of our innovation process, one of the measures is the number of hit products, $1 million sellers in the first year of after first year of being on the market. And I think you and I have been in this conservation that we were four, five \u2013 in the last couple of years, we were four times, five times what we were just in 2006 and we keep pushing that envelop.", "It's not so much \u2013 I think we're getting better at doing that. It's not so much a number counting game it's getting better and they're having more impact and they're driving more sales and they're doing better things.", "Like \u2013 just like, I'll tell you what, it sounds like not so important. But the idea of the combo ratcheting wrench that will have a low profile, 25% more \u2013 25% more strength, 95% more life, will get in smaller spaces, that one is going to be a great product for us, and people are so excited about it. People are saying that's the kind of thing we're \u2013 so I think we're not only bringing out a lot of them, bringing out better ones, because the whole product development process, we're more effective at it.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Thank you, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay, Gary.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Congrats on the quarter.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning, Richard.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Just curious about \u2013 on the new product development side, we're seeing more and more penetration of things that are related to active safety and autonomous driving or assisted-driving automated systems, these kinds of things.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "We love it.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Yeah. I was just going to ask, are you already preparing for these kinds of things...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yeah, we love that.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "...like what you're hearing from customers?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. Because we love this thing. I mean, if you think about it, okay, autonomous driving. The thing is that \u2013 if they go to autonomous driving, there used to be an incredibly \u2013 before autonomous driving, there would be an incredibly complex computer system for any imprecisions on the car, that was called the human brain. Think about alignment for example, if the car was a little bit out of alignment, you could adjust the wheel a little bit. Now, if you have autonomous driving, let's say automatic parking, you better not be out of alignment, you're going to hit the parking meter.", "And so that's going to require many more procedures and more precise procedures and we're the company to give it to you. So we love those kinds of actions. And so we're thinking about it, particularly around anything around calibration very much helps you. And that's sort of the equipment business \u2013 that's why we're so excited about the new V2400 aligner, because it's kind of a downtown aligner which creates more accuracy and therefore fits right into this.", "Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Leslie H.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Snap-on Incorporated 2015 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference. Just as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to your host for today, Leslie Kratcoski. Please, go ahead.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website under Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials", "The Snap-on fourth quarter; organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continued our positive trajectory of performance. Again this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impact of $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year.", "Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from $1.97 in 2014. And that rise reflects an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both financial services and OpCo, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. The results were encouraging.", "Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable. Changing technologies and aging vehicles are requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I Group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers.", "Now, for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I Group, markets were mixed, headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by few down sectors and macro economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were natural resources and the U.S. military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter.", "Oil and gas, a market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. The military sales: ongoing troop drawdown's and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop. But we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides.", "C&I's also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe and some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries like aviation, and in national markets like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and in emerging markets like India and Indonesia.", "So, overall, our businesses I would characterize \u2013 overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries, and building in emerging markets. These are the strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future. And we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward.", "And also, looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation processes; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities.", "Let's speak about the full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an OpCo earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points.", "That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group up 10.9%; RS&I increasing 4.9%; C&I rising 5.8%, all performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement.", "Now, let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. C&I: sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year with varied results across the group, gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation and decreases at the Industrial division.", "From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, nine quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, and the profits rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes; positive trends in some difficult geographies.", "Also in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815 18V Lithium Cordless Drill launched in the quarter. It's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools; an oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control; a heavy-duty gearbox reducing operating wobble and run-out, important for power tools. A precision single sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaw, increasing grip and torque and enabling one-handed bit changes; a nice time saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it.", "Now, the Industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation especially in customer connection and innovation, authoring new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges.", "One of those new products, designed for the natural resource sector, is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom engineered for a safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight with an aviation-grade aluminum body, five interchangeable heads for maximum versatility, and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in New York City area alone and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service.", "This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And, of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big seller; a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation, strengthening the C&I position in critical industries.", "Now, on to the Tools Group; an 8.7% rise in organic sales; an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70-basis point impact from negative currency.", "We speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth. Strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies.", "The measures of franchise health are all trending upward. And that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our band network in the robust vehicle repair arena. But beyond the numbers, there's qualitative but clearly observable evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter National Franchise Advisory Council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held earlier this month demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now.", "And there's more evidence. We continue to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneurs Magazine's List of Top 500 Franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a Top 50 Franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly innovation and customer connection creating an assortment of exciting new products, born from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased this number of hit products, million dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation, from our onsite experience in the workplace.", "Let's consider our new SPBS series of striking prybars; an upgrade in performance, in durability, and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angle design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material which performs in extremely low temperatures, in important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it features a new ergonomic handle that not only offers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection, and it represents progress even in a long, established product line.", "Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the Credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings \u2013 at our recent kickoff meetings held in the first part of the year. And they were working to increase the power of Credit and making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively every day. And the support of our Credit company is a major element in that progress.", "Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single digit increase to OEM dealerships, and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1% with RCI paving the way.", "RC&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell 1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers, and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contexts every year.", "Mitchell 1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events it already catalogs, making its unique SureTrack big data repair base even more powerful and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like APEC and more penetration of shops across the country.", "From our diagnostics division, also selling to independents; another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter; it was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees.", "It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we regularly receive testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable.", "VERUS Edge is quite a product; faster, easier, smarter. Technical service bulletins at hand, comprehensive diagnostics, and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair and is another winner with independent shops, it's clear.", "And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area, we continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more power train combinations. The PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again.", "Finally, in the period, RSI Equipment Division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops. With innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops with specialty or a dealer-like operation.", "A series of customer connection with those locations help us highlight the need for features like fast run-out measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and Smart Sonar, a pin-point laser light for positioning the adhesive weights on the wheel, and a highly intuitive and rapid touch screen interface. The B1200; faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So, that's RS&I; using Snap-on Value Creation, authoring innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers.", "And that's our fourth quarter; organic sales rising 3.1%; EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clear advancements down our runways for improvement; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group, as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment.", "On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased $5.7 million or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points.", "Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses.", "No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%.", "Financial services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%. And the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double digit increase in the segment's power tool operation.", "Gross profit in the C&I Group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries, and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations.", "Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points primarily due to a 70-basis point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility, as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points.", "Turning now to slide eight, fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year.", "Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year.", "Now, turning to slide 10, in the fourth quarter, operating earnings from financial services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million, compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels.", "Moving to slide 11, our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now, turning to slide 12, cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year.", "Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million.", "Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end.

Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease include the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures, and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.", "These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt to capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end.", "In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now, briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period; taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly, again. There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continue, so vehicle repair remains robust.", "In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continue moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality.", "Customer connection and innovation working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth and improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind.", "EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, against $0.11 of unfavorable currency. And a 19.1% OpCo operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll say a word to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are hearing this call. The encouraging results of our fourth quarter and the year and our potential for continuing the encouraging trends reflect your capability and your dedication. For the success you've achieved, for your contribution to our future and for your commitment to our team, you have my congratulations, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Tom Hayes of Northcoast Research.", "Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Yes. Nick, I was just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit more or provide a little bit more detail on the critical industries side. Certainly, military and oil and gas has been kind of a challenge in the year. Maybe talk about the cadence as it went through that quarter and then the outlook for 2016?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, I mean, I think, we're seeing deep declines in both of those places. We're talking multiple double digit declines in the military again and oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook we've set for some time that military \u2013 those two businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So, you see how much they influence the situation.", "So, you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military for a long time that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation and so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in a short-term or it could continue for a while.", "In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn, 70% decline in the business. I mean, in the oil price just in the last \u2013 in a recent time. And we haven't \u2013 we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw at the Iran-Iraq War. So, it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back.", "Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And maybe just a little bit...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "On the other hand, as we said in our release and our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So, you see some goes-ins and goes-outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military.", "Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just a question on the expense line, the operating expense was down meaningfully. How much of the decline was tied to \u2013 you called out less stock-based comp, how much of that was contributed to the decline?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't know.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Let's say about 20 basis points.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes, 20 basis points. The big thing, if you're looking at operating expenses, there's quite a few goes-ins and goes-outs, but a lot of that is RCI. But also, if you step back last year in the fourth quarter, we talked about the \u2013 there was a 53rd week. But 53rd week, in general, if I looked at it from the trajectory of the corporation, it was kind of not significant. It wasn't significant. It shouldn't change your view of where we're going.", "But if you start to look at it on account by account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses, because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts, you had an extra week of sales, 1.7% extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be an issue.", "But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant, in general, or would change your view of the corporation. But if you look at it on account, like operating expense, it really is a factor. And you have currency in operating expense as well. So, you have those things rolling through, RCI, currency and things like the special events of last year.", "Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Up next, from Longbow Research, we go to David MacGregor.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, everyone. Nick, can you just talk about demand patterns in January and any deterioration that may be visible beyond critical industries?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "We almost traditionally never talk about the current quarter. We never give guidance. But I will say, look, I will say, that I was just on a van out here in Addison Itaska (37:03), and I have to say that when I talked to the people in the field, both our franchisees and the customers \u2013 you get out of a van and you go from \u2013 you know this, you go from shop to shops. They all seemed very positive and that might stop with the positiveness and the optimism that I saw at the kickoff meetings. We have a lot of these around the country. And I was at one of them and the rest of our staff was at others and they come back, and certainly, we're seeing a qualitative view of optimism. And so, I can offer that.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Is there \u2013 just within that SG&A pullback, notwithstanding it was 70 basis points in the C&I business, I guess, I get that. But how much of that was just attributable to the weaker military and oil and gas business versus what may have been in that number in terms of structural cost takeouts? And I guess, also, can you say to what extent there may have been some cost items that were pushed forward into 1Q or pulled back into last quarter's...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't think we did that. I think \u2013 look, I think if you look at \u2013 if you're talking about \u2013 are you talking about the 130 basis points of margin improvement in C&I?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I was talking about the $16 million of SG&A drop, which was great. But I'm just trying to get a sense of what the nature of that was.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "That's overall, though. The $16 million is overall.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Right? That's not just for C&I.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Correct.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "And that didn't have much push or pull. What's in there is, like I said, you had currency, a big number of currency, with the currency year-over-year affects that SG&A and shrinks it. You have RCI. You've got \u2013 as somebody mentioned before, you have some goes-ins and goes-outs in terms of pension going the other way, compensation going one way. And you also have the 53rd week last year which was an extra week of operating expenses. Like I said \u2013 and so, therefore, the comparison issue isn't favorable, you get paid back at the sales line for that because the sales ends up being a little bit smaller. But if you look at it \u2013 I don't want to \u2013 I want to focus that, if you look at that one account, you start to see the effect of the 53rd week. If you look at it in total, it wasn't much of an effect for us.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Last question, just if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in tool storage and whether you're seeing a deceleration in demand patterns.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "No. No. Our big ticket items in total, we never talk particularly about tool storage, but our big ticket items in total were up a little bit more than the tools did (39:27) in the quarter. And I don't see that, really. I really don't see it. We haven't identified any particular cooling of that activity. Now, from quarter-to-quarter, these things always change. But I don't see as a downturn. Like I said, our big ticket items continued.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Liam Burke of Wunderlich.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Hey, Liam.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Good morning.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Nick, can you give us a sense \u2013 you had a good year in new product introductions and hit products. What can we look forward? I mean, are you continuing to see growth in that area with more new introductions to create more hit products?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes, I am. But, look, I hate to pin myself to the rack of continual increases in million-dollar hit products. I'm trying not to do that. But that's our drive. I can tell you this. We're getting better and better at customer connection and innovation. And if you think about it, a complex product line (40:37) 65,000-plus SKUs is asymmetrically (40:40) enabled by new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and some of the other things like X-ray diffractometers, which is new to us, and electron microscopes and so on.", "So, from a design point of view, we're getting better, so we don't have to put as much upfront into every product. And from a calling-the-airstrikes point of view, in other words, reacting to customer connection, we're getting better. And that has authored the continual improvement of our hit products. This year, it was up again. I would be aiming to bring it up next year, but we're not \u2013 it's not something we always report about. But I think every year, our new products become more impactful and more effective. I mean, just look at the VERUS Edge. The VERUS Edge is simply the best product available in diagnostics. And diagnostics is a rising category. It's faster, smarter, easier to use, and it gives you handheld access to our unique millions of records in \u2013 database of millions of records that allows technicians to shortcut the repair process. This is revolutionary, and that's just one thing.", "We pointed out the prybar today in our \u2013 now, we use the prybar for a reason. The prybar is just \u2013 it's a prybar, yet customer connection and innovation showed us how to make that long-standing category so much better. That's what's happening in Snap-on. That's what's driving the business for us. And it works in the Tools Group. And we're confident it's going to work for critical industries, although there's turbulence as you can see in critical industries with oil and gas. I mean, oil and gas, I think, we \u2013 oil and gas, and military, we never \u2013 we always said that our penetration was low and we wouldn't see an impact, but we didn't contemplate going from $115 oil to $30 oil, which is cataclysmic.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And with the end markets in the automotive repair continuing to grow, are you seeing any change in the competitive front?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't think so. I listen to the same publicity that you would listen to. And so people are \u2013 I think it's a robust market, so there's room for everybody to have some kind of good news in this market. But, when I go out \u2013 and I checked this the other day with our people, when I go out to the franchisees around the vans, they don't talk about the competitors. They talk about our business and how we can make it better. So I don't think we're seeing any kind of change at present.", "I rode on a van where the guy talks about the numbers of competitors that left his route, in other words, gave up the business and went out. He keeps track of it, but that's all. I mean, he doesn't worry about the competition. He worries about himself. He worries about, well, okay our \u2013 things like, questions like, our power tool is actually a lot better than our old power tool, the one I replaced. Or maybe it isn't as good. We need to make it a little bit better. Those are the kinds of things we talk about. Or how much our productivity advancements like providing \u2013 for the vans, providing a mobile tablet for van drivers, a couple of mobile tablets for a van. 570 of our van drivers have assistance and the mobile tablet allows them to spread both the principal and the assistant out into different areas, greatly increasing their reach. They talk about that and the efficacy of that. They don't talk about the competitors.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "From Barrington Research, we'll go to Gary Prestopino.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Hi, Gary.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Couple of questions here. I know somebody asked this about million-dollar products, but, Nick, could you maybe quantify what was the growth in million-plus products that you put out this year versus last year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I'm not going to actually quantify. I've tried to avoid quantifying that, and I'm not going to change that in this call. But I would say it was up this year by a reasonable margin. In fact, you might even call it a substantial margin in terms of what was launched. So we had a pretty good year in terms of new products. And remember, what I have said is that the number is now five times or six times what it was in 2006. That's a pretty...", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "...good number.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Pretty good increase.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "That's helpful. And you would anticipate that, obviously, you're going to continue to try and strive to put out more new products, especially --", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure. The whole point is yes. I'm probably not going to slit my wrists if it doesn't increase as much next year, you know what I mean? But certainly, we do target that and that's part of our plan. We would expect that to happen. We put the capabilities and the elements in place to make that happen. And we're getting \u2013 it's simply, Gary, we're getting better at it. We're getting better at it. You can see it in the Tools Group numbers.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "You know, okay, 8.7% against 1% or 2% GDPs.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Right. Can you maybe \u2013 we've \u2013 at least we think that you've had a recovery here for -- we're going into year seven, especially in the U.S. and the automotive market. Is there anything different that you're experiencing in this recovery versus maybe prior recoveries in your experience with Snap-on?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Actually, no. I don't think so. Actually, the recovery has been going on since 2009 and so I don't think so. I do think automotive repair, which is 70% of our business \u2013 70%-plus of our business -- is relatively robust determined by the aging of the vehicles and the changing of the vehicles which isn't interrupted so much by economics. And so, I think automotive repair is in a good place and makes us resistant to these \u2013 not immune to these kinds of changes, but resistant. I don't see any change there. Look, I think, if you look at other geographies and industries, they go up and down like you see in oil and gas and in military, like in anybody else, but I don't see anything different about those that I haven't seen in a number of different ups and downs except that maybe the oil and gas (47:37).", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Hello? Oh, Jesus.", "Operator", "Please stand by, while we reconnect with our speakers. One moment. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please stay on the line.", "[Music] (48:27 \u2013 48:37)", "Please stand by, as the speakers are joining. Give us just one moment. And you have rejoined. Please continue.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Hello, Gary, are you still there?", "Operator", "Yes, Gary, your line is open.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes. Sorry. What did you hear last? Sorry. We got cut off here, I guess.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "No. That was fine. I think we were talking about just maybe differences in the recovery, what you're seeing.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes. I don't think that much. I mean this is just \u2013 I mean certainly oil and gas is a bigger downturn than anybody's seen in a while. It's unusual, right? But other than that, I don't think so. This isn't our first rodeo. So, we've seen it. And automotive repair seems to be chunking along, I think.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then one last...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Doing pretty well. Sure.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "That's good to hear. One last question for Aldo; in terms of your international sales, they run, what, about 25% of your business, right, somewhere around there?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Yes. That's a \u2013 I think you have Europe is about 18% of the mix and emerging markets add another 10%.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "That's what I'm getting at. In terms of currencies, the currencies that really impact you would probably be the pound, the euro and then what else?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "You have it pretty much right. If you're looking at the sales line, Gary, the most important currency that creates a headwind is the euro. In addition to the euro, you have the Canadian dollar. Lot of people forget about that, but the Canadian dollar, the British pound would be the next most significant ones.", "When it comes to the bottom line, we have more natural hedges throughout the continent of Europe. So, the euro actually has less of an impact on the bottom line. The biggest impact to our profitability is actually the Canadian dollar, the British pound.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. So, the Canadian dollar and the pound are on (50:37)", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Gee, that's why you see most of the impact manifesting itself in the Tools Group. If you think about the Tools Group is largely a sales footprint. So, they don't have a lot of cost that enjoy the benefit of the haircut in the weaker currencies in the United Kingdom and in Canada or Australia for that matter. So they don't enjoy the protection that you get where you have a euro-based organization. There's a lot more cost that decrease in U.S. dollar terms.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes. The Tools Group was up 17.5% \u2013 was up 100 basis points. But that was against 70 basis points of negative currency. So, you can see where that affects, okay?", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Leiker, Robert W. Baird.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink in for David.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "The one slice of C&I that I don't believe you commented on yet was Asia. Any updates on growth rates or trends from the Asia Pacific region?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "It was mixed in the quarter. China was weaker than we've seen in a while. And so, we had China being weak and we had some \u2013 whereas Indonesia had been weak before. Indonesia was up, India was up, so we kind of had a balance there in terms of our mix in Asia Pacific, China being more difficult in this quarter. We see a lot of variation from quarter-to-quarter in Asia Pacific.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And in China, is it possible to determine \u2013 this will sound strange, but if a slowdown in new vehicle demand, which may actually cause the fleet to age a bit ultimately ends up being more beneficial to Snap-on?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't know. I don't think so. I mean, I kind of think the cars that are there in the park, they're going to age anyway. I don't think that the cars or the new cars that are being purchased are making the old cars go away. That's what I think. I don't think they're shipping those overseas to any big extent. Now, I could be wrong about that, but that's our general impression about China, it's a lot of different markets and a lot of different areas. I think the slowdown would probably help some, but I don't think it would be as big a factor as you might think. It's usually the size of the park.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And then one last one on C&I. Is there any correlation in the military business for Snap-on to the wheeled vehicle programs getting rolled out? So if JLTV production starts ramping at Oshkosh, does Snap-on typically see a benefit in their defense business?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, I don't know if we've tied to particularly Oshkosh or something like that, but certainly, wheeling out of new programs help us a lot. For example, the F-35 is a help to us, the fighter vehicle, the fighter, because we have a lot of the business associated with supporting that for both production and for repair. So that kind of program is an underlying program.", "But across the programs in the defense department, particularly around the projects, around with those new products, that business is very weak \u2013 was very weak this quarter. If they launch new products, like you say, a wheeled vehicle product at Oshkosh, that provides an opportunity and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. So those kinds of programs, new vehicles do help us. But I don't know...", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And so...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I don't know if you can just trace it to an Oshkosh program.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "No, no. I was thinking more broadly on the programs that you commented on. And so, is it, maybe, fair to say the duration of this pullback in military spending might be shorter than what's Snap-on dealt with in 2012, 2013, around the sequester?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes. Gee. I don't know. I think the government business is kind of uncertain. We've said, the military business was up in the quarter \u2013 up in the first two quarters. And we said we knew it was going to be uncertain. And now when it's down, I still say the same thing. Certainly, the things you're talking about. New programs are going to help and would shorten the cycle. That's true. Stabilization of the budget would help. It may be not as chronic as the controller of the prior cycle, but I can't really say for sure.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "From Jefferies, we'll hear from Bret Jordan.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "Good morning. This is actually David Kelley in for Bret this morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick follow-ups on RS&I here. And I guess first regarding the flat undercar sales you mentioned. I know U.S. service chain reported a fourth quarter comp decline and largely due to some mild winter weather conditions along the East Coast. Just wondering if you saw some weather-related headwinds in the quarter and I guess how was domestic undercar performance? And how do we think about that segment going forward given the robust auto repair market we're talking about and really some of the significant miles driven gains we've seen over the last three months...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Yes. Look, there's a lot of goes-ins and goes-outs in the undercar equipment business. First and foremost, that flatness is impacted by Eastern Europe. Among all our businesses, the undercar equipment business had the strongest position in Eastern Europe and Russia. So, the dips in those places impacted that business as just squeezed down to a smaller place the most. That's number one.", "In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been \u2013 say, it might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite \u2013 our undercar business is a longer wave business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter like we had in the third quarter, sometimes you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products, flowing into the next quarter which will put a weight on the next quarter.", "So, you see those three things rolling through it. I would expect \u2013 to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, as the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So, we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "All right, great. I appreciate the color. And then, just quickly, if you can provide some, maybe, color around the 260 basis points margin expansion for RS&I; just wondering how much of that is basic blocking and tackling around these RCI initiatives that continue to provide you, guys, tailwinds here?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, RCI is a big dollop of it. And then, of the 260 basis points, I would say, you've got a little bit of negative currency, and you got about 70 basis points or so, what I would call favorable mix. As you follow us over time, you will see that RS&I has quite a variation from business to business in terms of operating margin. It could be thousands of basis points.", "And so, what happened in this quarter is we had another strong quarter of diagnostics and Mitchell, the business to independents which are high margin business, and a reduction of the hardware business which is equipment. So, that generated that 70 basis points, or so, of help from business mix. So, that's what you're seeing. RCI and business mix.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "All right, great. Thank you. And then, just a final one from me and this is more kind of a big picture thought question here. You're mentioning sales to OEM dealerships were up again single digits. And I guess as we think about maybe being on the back end of a cyclical recovery in new vehicle sales, do you think there might be a shift in dealership ordering patterns of equipment, either they're focusing more on parts than service retention or maybe they're spending less due to a flat retail sales market? How do you think about the dealership channel over the next...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "I'm not sure. Having worked in the auto industry for 11 years myself, I would say that's a hard call. I mean, I don't think you can make a lot out of this. I guess, we were saying mid-single digits or low single digits in the OEM dealership business this quarter. But I don't think you can make a conclusion on one quarter. Some of that got driven by programs out of OEM manufacturers, the essential diagnostics and so on. I do think you make a point that as new car sales attenuate, dealerships tend to focus a little bit more on parts and service. I think that is true to the extent that the time constants on which that rolls into our business, I'm not sure.", "David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC", "All right, great. Thanks for taking my question.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "David MacGregor of Longbow Research has a follow-up question. Please go ahead.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Just a follow-up, Nick; somewhere within your portfolio, there's got to be a line of business or a product or some franchise that serves as a pretty reliable leading indicator for you. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you're seeing leading indicators in your business and basically what they're telling you. There's obviously some concerns here about your ability to sustain growth in 2016. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about why you're feeling confident to \u2013 certainly in the first half of 2016?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Well, our leading indicators are pretty much what we hear from our franchisees and what we see about the programs in terms of the changing of the vehicles and what we hear from our franchisees about their outlooks for the demand in their businesses. You can go out and talk to them, and the leading indicators are, gee, are we providing the kinds of tools that would solve the new problems that are coming on the horizons in the independent garages?", "Now, this isn't a quantitative leading indicator, but it's been pretty reliable for us. And so what we see is the optimism coming out from them saying, boy, I think things are good and the fact that we our new product portfolios, our innovative new products are solving more problems than ever. Those are the kinds of things and that hasn't abated. So, I feel pretty good about that business. And in terms of the other businesses, I just think we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries. It's just that you see some very big headwinds in some of those critical industries. And I can't predict where those are going to go.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you just remind us again what...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "On the other hand, I will just offer that, we've seen up and down before and we've been able to grow profitability against the winds; not every quarter necessarily but in terms of a trend. We view our situation as a trend. If you go back and you look at our numbers from 2006 onwards, sales and profits, the trend continued and even through the recession, and the dip in the recession, that trend continued.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "So, you continue to see growth in your future-dated orders?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "We don't have future-dated orders, really. We're not a future-dated order business. So, we don't have much of an order backlog.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "We don't have that kind of thing. We have to rely on the kinds of things I've talked about.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "All right. Okay. And just last question. Can you just remind us what critical industries represents as a percentage of total C&I?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "It represents about I'd say 40%. David, you can say given for government worth, it's $450 million business roughly, right?", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right, right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Thanks, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our final question today will come from Richard Hilgert of Morningstar.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, Richard.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Just wanted to get your feel for what you're seeing in terms of puts and takes with some of the issues that we're facing right now on the new car side of the business. We're seeing diesel being a big issue right now. We're seeing hybrids being a big issue. We're seeing active safety coming into play over the next couple of years. I would imagine that with more and more electronic control, there's going to be more opportunities for diagnostics, maybe, but also I'm wondering on the Tools side, if there's any opportunities there. What's some of the puts and takes that you're seeing with all these changes coming down the pike?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Actually, Richard, all of those things are positive for our business. When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes. If you just take one and if you think about self-driving vehicles and things like that, I mean, the more people rely on internal mechanisms inside the car, the more precise calibration has to be, and therefore, the more careful and more detailed the mechanical job is, the mechanics have to be.", "And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more attended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And, ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from \u2013 in the 1990s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the reparability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars have become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose associated with electronics.", "So, all of those things are good for us. We see a very positive future and trend, and we're confident. That continues the trend that you see in our numbers. If you look at our numbers and you see over periods of time, sales and OI margin, continual trends in good times and challenged times.", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.", "Okay.", "Operator", "And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski for closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please, go ahead.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks, Lindy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.

These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "With that said, I'd now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we made, and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from financial services, it bring Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015.", "And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on an organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on value creation processes, the suite of principles we use every day around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results, those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Now currency has been a headwind for some time, both to sales and profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on value creation, especially with innovation and with RCI.", "Innovation; taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products. You see, that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we are only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. RCI; ongoing improvement, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction, up and down and across the corporation. Innovation in RCI; overcoming the challenges, extending the trend of rising profits again.", "Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment, more solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles requiring advanced solutions. And an aging fleet, driving more repairs, both factors in play not only in the United States but worldwide and the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwinds. They show and -- they not only reflect the tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage to progress down our runways for growth.", "Consider the tools group; organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tasks, making work easier for technicians and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful. And repair systems information, or our RSI group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions but most notably in diagnostic and repair information businesses, in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers.", "C&I; it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter the results showed the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors and the difficulties of a few trouble geographies. In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the US military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly with both segments showing the impact of ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East, where aerospace project activity was down due in part to macro development in that turbulent -- in that region, pretty turbulent there.", "That said, all that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single digit growth in places like the UK, Spain and the Nordic region, while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall I'd describe our C&I market as mixed turbulence and strength. Deep challenges, but we're also encouraged by the advancements, taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with the string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair related businesses, on a whole, we believe there is clear progress along our runways for growth -- enhancing the van network, expanding repair shop owners and managers, building in emerging markets, and yes, extending to critical industries. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line, in our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets.", "Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the power tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher margin critical industry business. But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this particularly in our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings.", "One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on three-quarter inch flank drive 12 point impact socket. You pick these up, they are a handful, big, but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining and oil and gas sectors; perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earth-moving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places, anyplace where heavy work gets done. They are ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and they incorporate Snap-on's flank drive which move stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Elkmont plant, and they are a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers.", "Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system, or AGC, the smart tool storage unit which electronically keeps track of the who, the when, and the where of individual tool usage, it's popular. In the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of tool control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Dual, off-the-shelf or custom-built, utilizes visible control trays to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom cut foam or with CAD-designed tool silhouettes. It's the perfect addition to any place where work is performed within the site of tool storage, like assembly line, and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI.", "And I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe and the continuing new advancement there was clearly evident in its mid-single digit sales gains, marking now ten straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential and these days of significant variation, we're building our physical capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter with sales rising compared to last year.", "So now onto the tools group; organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year. The tools group, the results continue to speak for themselves, ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise channel. And there is abundant evidence of growing strength and of ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics, important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely and again this quarter they are favorable across the Board and they continue to trend upward. There is also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year like our January kickoff meetings held all over the network, orders were up considerably, and atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they are brimming with confidence, reaching higher and expecting to achieve and grow.", "The tools group was marked by growth, but it was also driven by Snap-on value creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress, offering [ph] innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. An example of that is our Snap-on 312 CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured up the road in our Milwaukee plant, the next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee sophisticated cold forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance, and longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage.", "The 312, using both those edges in a new leverage, the 312 CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure points, added material in those places, reducing the breakage, tip breakage, even when these pliers are engaged in the toughest task. And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer connections showed that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability, and comfort. The 312 CF provides just that, and we expect strong sales, even in an established category.", "Also in the quarter, the tools group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for a dog's age, a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions with a reduced height, provides better -- that reduced height provides better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath dash spaces and any difficult to reach area. The new design also features laser welded pivot points and the weld beads are machines flushed to the socket for improved appearance and safety. It adds a smooth full 30 degree swivel action for more efficient power. Power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging tasks of today's more complex engine compartments.", "Snap-on innovation; a tradition in Snap-on since 1920, but we believe getting much better helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the tools group is not just product, it's also based on amplifying the capability of our franchisees and the power of our network. The Rock n Roll pads and the Techno Express are great examples of that. But now we are also enabling our team with the Chrome Express Plus System, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add an assistant to the route. While Chrome Express Plus enables that add, making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers, it's another clear opportunity for more growth.", "And we can't talk about tools group without speaking of its strategic partner, our financial services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big ticket sales, serving as a great assist to our tools business and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out vividly in the quarter's results.", "Now let's speak of RS&I; first quarter organic sales rose 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers, operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. RS&I; we're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, rapid continuous improvement, driving margin expansion, it's evident again in this quarter in the strong earnings. I often speak of this, the successful handheld -- our successful line of handheld diagnostic units, well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops.", "In the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted publicly. Our SOLUS Edge and our ETHOS Tech handhelds were honored by Undercard Digest, both recognized by that magazine as a Top 10 tool. The SOLUS Edge, faster processing, larger screen, the power of Mitchell 1 SureTrack, all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. And the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first-time diagnostic buyer. Both handhelds were selected by the votes of technicians and shop owners who use these tools every day and who read Undercard Digest.", "One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters is the ongoing stream of innovations made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in this quarter, RS&I launched its shift -- launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the VERUS Edge handheld, and it's paired with a custom roll cart for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this visibly reinforcing independent repair shops capabilities, building that customer confidence, so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology.", "In addition this quarter, our equipment division launched what we believe to be a game changer, the V3300 wheel aligner, a next generation unit targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships, faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We've already received enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers and we are confident it's another share taker.", "Finally, RSI continued its expansion into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on Pro-Link Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building and expanding presence in the heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S.", "So that's the highlights.", "Continued progress; organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on value creation processes, especially innovation in RS&I, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin, up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, it was an encouraging quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment.", "On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition related sales, increased $6.4 million, or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the US dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%.", "Financial services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%. And the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, or C&I, group on Slide 7, sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by a double-digit increase in the segment's Asia-Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's power tools operations, and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based handtools business.", "Gross profit in the C&I group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margins of 38.5% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to a decrease in higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year.", "Turning now to Slide 8, first quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "Operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the Company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year.", "Turning to the repair systems information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9, first quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, a low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels.

The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels.", "Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our US financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items like the Snap-on tools group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.", "Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year.", "Turning to Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days at 2015 year-end.

On a trailing twelve month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end.", "Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million, and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end.", "In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. That's our first quarter, performance against the wind. We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runway for both improvement and growth.", "Enhancing the van channel, the tools group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the van channel more powerfully, the Rock n Roll CADs to the Techno Express and now the Chrome Express Plus enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. Expanding repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%. OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair.", "Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries. Turbulence, but we still see progress. Clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage.", "And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on value creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year, again. And when you add that opco performance to our financial services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability, a 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter, and one which points clearly to continued and significant gains as we move forward.", "Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to our franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening, the progress of our first quarter most clearly reflects your extraordinary capability and your unique dedication. For the skills you bring to our company, for the energy you devote to our efforts and for the commitment you give to our team, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. The auto repair and maintenance end market seems to be working in your favor. The macro trends seem to be strong now and sustainable. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Not really. I'm sure -- you know, we have a fairly strong position in these markets, as you know. And generally, as I've said many times on these calls, built on I think the overwhelming capability of our van network and the skill of our franchisees, and the ongoing understanding of the repair shop, we generally reflect back on ourselves. So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mentioned the competition although I'm sure is formidable. They mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that really. And I think the tools group numbers seem to say that. Their numbers look pretty good. They continually make this up. They've been up 6% or greater 23 of 24 quarters.", "One of the things I like to say about that, I think one of the investment theses about Snap-on is that Snap-on is a company that is so much more -- so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the tools group, the van channel, has been around for decades, and yet they have been able to do this by creating a bigger plume and being able to expand so dramatically by creating a greater plume of new product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'n Roll cads and Techno Express and now Chrome Express Plus, how to wield those vans more effectively. That's what's happening with us in the market.", "Liam Burke", "Thanks Nick. And also on the diagnostic side, you mentioned the handheld as some of the key product introductions and innovation you're getting there. If you look at the diagnostics business in general, is most of the growth coming out of handheld or do you have some innovative products coming into the service station owner and manager?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "If you look at RS&I; we are getting growth in a broad range. Diagnostic stuff is growing very strongly. If you look at big-ticket items in the tools group, which is the bigger diagnostics and the tool storage and so on, they are up higher than -- they're growing faster than the tools group. So that looks pretty strong. We keep innovating around handhelds, and that's of course some of the spiffy stuff people like to talk about because people want more diagnostics as the cars get more complex. But also if you look at equipment, you will see that in terms of the new aligners we brought out. And behind the aligners, there's an array of new balancers and so on. And then finally, we keep enhancing our software product like this SureTrack, which accesses hundreds of millions of actual repair events and allows technicians to pinpoint the possible repair and shortcut to that repair through big data. That's an exciting product which is going into the garage at the same time.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thanks, Nick.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "David Leiker", "Good morning everyone. A couple of things I want to walk through. In C&I, you still have I think at least another quarter here of tough comps year-over-year. Is that right?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, look, I think at C&I if you look at this, I think you could say you'd be allowed to the fact that oil and gas gets -- it wasn't as we did in the first quarter last year, if you remember, in oil and gas. The second quarter started tail off. So I think oil and gas tends to get a little easier moving into the second quarter. But military was strong and international aviation was strong in the second quarter. So we still have another quarter of batting up against that. It tends to get easier in the third and fourth quarter. I don't want to say easier, but it tends to be less high of a bar.", "David Leiker", "Yes, and if I remember correctly, your fourth quarter for oil and gas, energy, military, that Q4 tone was slightly weaker than Q3. What does it look like in the first quarter versus Q4?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "It's weaker. Both of those are weaker in the first quarter than they were in Q4. I think marginally. I'd say marginally weaker. It's somewhat weaker though. It's hard to say, David, because you've got fourth quarter over first quarter. You might have some mild seasonality flowing through that, but I would say mildly weaker.", "David Leiker", "Do you think when we get to that point through these comps in the second half that they are more normalized, that those businesses are down single digits instead of double digits?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I'm not in the business of forecasting that, but certainly we'd come back to substantially lower comparisons. And so that by arithmetic changes the whole situation. And then remember, we keep investing in those businesses. We brought out -- I just want to point out, we had a tough year in the military, and we brought out over 700 new products aimed at the military. So, we keep positioning ourselves for this, so we are ready to go. We are all dressed up. When the party comes, we are ready to dance.", "David Leiker", "And then Aldo, just a question for you on currency, a lot of details you split out there. Is there a way that you can, on the EBIT line, split out how much of that currency effect was translation versus transactional currency? Could some of these cross-currency relationships seem to be a little bit out of balance with what we normally would see?", "Aldo Pagliari", "We do. I don't want to actually give the internal calculus around that number, but I think, to help you out, as you look forward looking at today's currency rates, transaction will be the greater burden that affects the EBIT calculation so to speak and translation abates a little bit as you go forward using today's rates if you march forward in time.", "David Leiker", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "David Kelley", "Good morning everyone, this is David Kelley in for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions. And a couple ones, and first I guess a follow-up to an earlier question. The US franchisee base posted really another excellent quarter here. And I know there's been some discussion of a sequential slowdown through Q1 from an aftermarket distributor that reported earlier this week. Is that something that impacted you at all either from your franchisees or let's say RS&I sell-through to the non-dealer channel? And I guess to that point, could you give us maybe a general feel for cadence and tools and RS&I performance throughout the quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don't think we want to give you cadence throughout the quarter, I don't think \u2013 look, I think we are not seeing -- I wouldn't say we are seeing any marked change in the auto repair related businesses. When we go, either in our numbers or when I go out and visit the garage, when I ride these vans. One of the interesting things about our view of the economy is this, is when we look at -- we parse it between auto related and the industrial. We did it in my remarks. But you know, I think one of the fascinating it's about today's environment is it's big to small -- I mean small-to-big. If you're out in the small garage, if you're out in these garages, they are feeling good. They are confident. They are great.", "So those businesses, the small businesses, to us in our sectors seem uniformly to be enthusiastic and confident and doing very well. As you rise in the size of business, the amount of cautiousness increases. And you can see that in our businesses as well. So when we are selling to the garage from garage to garage, from dealership to dealership, we see good things. When we are engaging with let's say the OEMs or the manufacturers, that's a little bit more tepid. But to answer your question directly, at the grassroots level, we are not seeing any abatement in this. In fact, our franchisees are only getting more confident as far as I can tell.", "David Kelley", "Great. I really appreciate that color. And I guess just a quick follow-up. As you talk about the grassroots movement and the strength at the garage level, what do you see as the better opportunity in 2016? Are we selling more to the mechanics or the shop owners with some of diagnostic equipment?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, actually, it merged a little bit because what's happening is that it used to be that much of the bigger diagnostic equipment was sold to the shop, and it was spread around. It was shared between technicians. What's happening now is while 40% to 50% of the repairs in a -- of the car-park, the 300 million car, vehicle car-park, 40% or 50% of those repairs require a diagnostic unit. 80% of the new car repairs require a diagnostic unit. So every technician is going to need a diagnostic unit from that ETHOS read and reset to all the way up to our VERUS PRO that will solve the most puzzling of problems. And so we are seeing more sales now to individuals. But we are also seeing -- that's the market situation. But RS&I has only within the last, let's say within the last five or six years started -- five, six, seven years -- started to focus on repair shop owners and managers as a particular customer base. So, you see that opportunity unfold for us as we learn what they need, and we arm our quiver with more products. We give us more to sell to those guys. So I would say the market is going really robustly for the technicians. Shop owners and managers are still buying but we have a particular share gain opportunity with owners and managers.", "David Kelley", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then one more for me and I'll jump back into queue here. Can you maybe give us some color on the impact of the lower stock-based compensation and pension expense on corporate expense? And then if we think about the last few years, you've run I think roughly $100 million annualized corporate expense. How do we think about the full-year run rate for 2016?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I think we kind of give guidance around $25 million a quarter or so on. So it's interesting. Last year in the quarter, we had a particularly expensive mark-to-market event that drove corporate expense up. I think it was $29 million and change. This year, we had a particularly favorable one which brought it down to $21 million and change. Really the $21 million compares to a $25 million run rate if you really want to think of it in those terms. If you talk about operating expense, yes. In operating expense, there's that mark-to-market and the pension expense that's in there that's making some of the improvements in operating expense. What we do is when we look at our numbers, we say this, yes, we've got good news from mark-to-market but we got bad news from currency. They about balanced, mark-to-market and pension currency, and we still grew EPS at 15.5%.", "David Kelley", "Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks again.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Good morning, everyone. You caught my attention with the observation of franchisees adding help on the van, and that should drive sales productivity. Do you have a count on -- I know you've got 3,500 trucks running in the United States.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "That's a ballpark, it's 3,475. I don't know that number. It's written on might shorts here. That's why I see it every morning.", "David MacGregor", "Do you have a figure on growth, just to what extent you are selling\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, I don't want to get in the business of reporting that, but let's just say that that is a small number so far. In the 15% to 20% range of the franchisees have those as systems. As you know, most of them -- and it's a franchisee's choice to make the decision. We enable it with things like Chrome Express Plus and other things. But what I see when I go to these kickoffs or go to the National Franchisee Advisory Council and talk to these, the more the franchisees see the success of other people with these assistance, the more they say, hey, maybe I could do this. I could hire new guys. I could reach more customers. I can increase my sales. And they are looking at that because, now, having grown for 23 out of 24 quarters 6% or greater, they want this growth. They expect it and so they are looking for things which could make their businesses better.", "David MacGregor", "The other question I had for you was just the disparity in growth rates between your originations on the credit business and the tools growth. And I'm just wondering if you can talk were there any changes within the credit model and the extent to which this has helped you with your most creditworthy customers, drive\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Look, I think there are lots of things floating through here. It depends how long wave you want to look at it. If you look at it in any one particular quarter, you are talking -- first of all, you are talking big ticket items. So, big ticket items in this particular quarter, tool storage, big diagnostic and so on, they grew faster than the tools group, so it's hard to match that. Plus there's a timing question and then a sales tech on top of it. So there is a lot of things that goes on in the individual quarters. If you are saying have we wielded credit more effectively or more broadly, we have, because what we've done is we've spent a lot of time determining, determining, determining who are our best franchisees, and how they are good at credit. There's been no change in the credit model really. There's been no change in the credit model. But we have done a great job I think of using those franchisees who have the best instincts and insight and capability around credit, and enlisting them in the credit company to advance this kind of activity.", "David MacGregor", "You have a history of managing credit very effectively, so I was more focused on the extent to which this may put more purchasing power in the hands of your customers to buy bigger ticket items going forward.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "There is some of that, but we haven't really changed it. It can make it possible for certain people who couldn't get credit before, who happen to be in a route that's superintended by one of the people that we now think is a great credit guy, what we call a Platinum Elite guy. That could make that change. But generally we've kind of held it. We've kind of held that model I think, except for this engaging the knowledge of the franchisee.", "David MacGregor", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Gary Prestopino", "Good morning everyone. Nick, is the Chrome Express Plus, is that the program of putting assistance on the vans? I'm a little confused there.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "You know what it is? The Chrome Express Plus is an adjunct to our new computer system. Several years ago, we rolled out a new computer system, point-of-sale system, for the van. And then more recently, we have added Chrome Express Plus, which allows mobile, tablets, multiple tablets to roll out from the van. And what I am saying is the franchisees, the franchisees have looked at their situation and realized that, boy, they would like to add selling time. So they have made the decision, on an individual basis pretty much, it has been a grassroots effort, to try to pick up assistance. And then this Chrome Express Plus is a response to that help enable them. We don't have a program to bring on assistants. We are not sponsoring a program or anything like that. It's fundamentally the franchisees themselves because after all these are independent businessmen who make these decisions. But we have created Chrome Express Plus that really leverages -- if you have an assistant, chrome express plus really helps you. And it really helps the assistants that is there. That's what I was trying to say.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. I was just a little confused on that. And then on the diagnostic side, interesting comments about -- you are saying number of cars or amount of cars that now need some kind of diagnostic usage and repair. But is there something within these diagnostic products that you are putting out that make older ones more obsolete? Is it just computing power, amount of information they can show? I'm just trying to get an idea of how long one of these techs can use a diagnostic tool effectively before he or she has to switch\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "In a way, Gary, it's a little bit like a TV. You could still be using a tube, I suppose, but every time there are two pieces here. One is software, we keep updating software. I want to say a couple of times a year we keep updating software. Then we bring out so you could be having an existing handheld and keep updating the software, keep updating the software. Eventually that software might not be run so effectively on some of the older models. That is one, so you would want to change. Secondly, again, it's like a TV. We bring out the newer models, and they have features, touchscreen feature. The new SOLUS, you turn it on, it comes on in like seconds, five seconds. The older one was slower. VERUS Edge, you can get technical service bulletins. You go out on the Internet and you get SureTrack on it, different capabilities. By the way, it's about -- it's substantially lighter and better ergonomics than it was. So you have these two things going on. So if you behold one of these new diagnostics, and this happens all of the time, because people say, gee, I'd really like to use this; it is a lot lighter; it would be effective for me; it's a lot quicker; it's more easy with a touchscreen. So people tend to want to upgrade. So we keep enhancing those. And there is software on top of it.", "Gary Prestopino", "Thanks. And just for Aldo, did I hear you right that you said currency has negatively impacted net earnings by about $8.1 million this quarter?", "Aldo Pagliari", "That's correct. That's the bottom-line impact.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. So in terms of translation, which currency is going to have more impact as we go forward? Is it the euro or the pound?", "Aldo Pagliari", "The euro historically would be the biggest currency, and in 2015 was the biggest decrement to sales. That is starting to wane now as the euro has stabilizes. So as you go forward I think you look at the pound and the Canadian dollar will start to factor in, but I would say that's my best description right now, Gary. I think you'll see less translation negative impact coming from the euro, yet within the Company, there is still some transaction drag that's created from the currency mix that we have.", "Gary Prestopino", "Alright, that's what I thought. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Richard Hilgert", "Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. How are you?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Good morning. How are you?", "Richard Hilgert", "Doing well, thanks. And thanks for taking my questions this morning.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Richard Hilgert", "I just wanted to go back to a couple of things. The corporate expense line for coming to operating earnings, that was an $8.4 million reduction from last year to this year. And did I hear you right, this is related to pension expense but it sounded like you were talking about currency too. So am I to assume that this is the\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, there is couple pieces to that, one is of course pension expense, it's between -- I think that's between $1 million and $2 million, something like that. And the rest is principally marked-to-market around the stock-based compensation. So basically when the stock price goes down, you get good news. When it goes up, you get a mark-to-market. So what happened last year is a little bit misleading because last year -- that difference is versus last year, and last year the stock price went up in the quarter. So we had bad news in mark-to-market. And so you are comparing the bad -- the good news this year with the bad news last year, and so you get an expanded number in the $6 million range.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, got you. So mark-to-market on the stock compensation expense.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes.", "Richard Hilgert", "Alright. And then on receivables in the finance group, you guys did a great job bringing on receivables that were up 17% in the quarter. So really good loan origination going on. I'm curious. You mentioned earlier about Premium Elite status franchisees. Is this because of their efforts to increase the credit portfolio, or is this driven because there is a different mix in what loans are being originated or\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, no, no. What this means is this is the kind of framework which we've had for some time. The broader characterization is Platinum. These are people who are engaging in the credit program. They are spending time thinking about how to deal with credit. And the better guys, the top end guys, are what we call the Platinum Elite. And what this really means, Richard, is certain franchisees can judge credit, can add to our credit model. We have -- our credit process is like this", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, great. And it sounds like these guys, being more adept at credit policy, are better able to identify potential risks that even though you're penetrating your market more so on the finance side, the risk that you are taking on hasn't changed. Is that a fair statement?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Any other -- most other credit facilities, through the eyes of these people, we actually know the borrower very, very well, and that's the essence of how we keep the losses down so low.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, very good. Thanks again for taking my questions.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Okay.", "Operator", "And this concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Leslie for closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "We appreciate you joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on Snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time.

(Broker)", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2016 Second Quarter Results Conference Call.", "Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer, and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions.", "As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "This presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or they substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our Q2 earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start this call with some of the highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "Our second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements that along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or to $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition.", "Now, organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. OpCo operating margin expanded by 140 basis points and earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The OpCo operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140-basis point increase reflects a higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For Financial Services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with OpCo to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points.", "From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remained strong and that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. They continue to make progress in the quarter both in and outside the United States.", "The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%, once again demonstrating its ability to expand on our already-strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleets.", "In RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in undercar equipment, and broad progress in most regions.", "For the Commercial & Industrial Group \u2013 well, for Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remained, spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region.", "That said, there were positive industrial sectors, in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the tests, our increasing understanding of the tests and our extending product lines that enable that work.", "Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe, in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain, in a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty.", "So the overall results remain positive, strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe. Opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it, and the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on Value Creation, our Snap-On Value Creation Processes in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made at customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car part and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world.", "And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive-by-wire, is the growing need for more precision in mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-On innovation is responding to that opportunity and the products that support the need for precision and insight help drive our sales and our margins in the quarter.", "Customer connection and innovation and in fact all of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement everyday driving our 140-basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. So that's the overview. That's the macro overview.", "Now, let's turn to the groups, let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia/Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 50-basis point decrease impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry business.", "For the Industrial division, we had headwinds, but as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher bolstered by innovative new products like our latest in Tool Control solutions, the Automated Tool Control locker. You may remember, our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to a regularly shaped items, like extension cords, toolkits, and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops.", "The new ATC locker makes tracking those non-standard tools easy and reliable, and like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from a central site, displaying the tool control status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage are really important feature in those critical aviation applications; we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, doing well.", "Now, we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. While the Industrial division is constantly introducing new products, born out of that value creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment, special conductivity to dissipate static and in a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise, detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, two special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection and action making work easier in the aviation sector, that's what these screwdrivers are.", "Another customer connection, this time the offset crowfoot adaptor for the specially configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welding tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators \u2013 we've all see them on the top of transformers \u2013 damage that equals critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer task and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool, that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector.", "Now, let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double-dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying-off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in a very uncertain economic environment of Europe. And profit, Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit.", "Our Asia/Pacific operations also contributed positively and we kept investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story, turbulence in certain critical industries partially offset by progress in other divisions.", "Now, let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120-basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins, and perhaps most importantly in the overall franchisee health metrics, which are all trending positively again this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new 1/4-inch Drive Extra Long Flex Head Ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult-to-reach spots under the dash, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited, and it combines our patented dual pawl system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power in less lateral space at a distance.", "It's manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handle tools, designed specifically to make the technicians toughest jobs much easier and we believe it does just that. And early sales have been robust.", "Now, we've been making torque products for some time. In the second quarter \u2013 but in the second quarter, we launched the heavy-duty 0.5 inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the Brutus, the Brutus 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It solves a critical need, making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required.", "Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on buried components, some above 250-foot pounds, big components like brake calipers, pitman arms, and wheel hubs. Previously, a technician would go through a time consuming multi-tool procedure or sometimes just torque by judgment. The Brutus uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles.", "Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network and again this quarter it did just that. So that's the Tools Group. New products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins.", "Now onto RSI, solid across the group, organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%, operating margin 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress, operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions.", "Whether it's the top of the line, VERUS Edge with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins, and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS Edge for advanced professionals or for the entry-level technician, the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-On line-up of handhelds makes work easier across the garage.", "Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service, so the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell 1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search results, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database, all of it saving the technician's time. The Mitchell 1 solution gets better every quarter, and we see it in the results. In sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits with growth registered in the U.S. and our international markets.", "The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts, and Pro-Cut break lathes, both expanding the Snap-on presence in the garage, and both progressing well in the quarter with products like Challenger's versatile CL12 lift, 3-stage Low Profile arms from more flexibility, and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more positioned in rotor matching, more repeatability of \u2013 stay calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision, that means more wheel alignment and more rotor matching and Snap-on has the products that make it easier.", "Speaking about hit products and alignments, last quarter, I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game-changer, and so it was. Based on it \u2013 so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks, now with the full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like lane departure systems or adaptive cruise control and the V3300 fits that trend. More alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset.", "So to wrap-up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation together with the Tools Group of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers.", "Well, that's the highlights of the quarter. Growth and improvement. Progress, along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; OpCo operating income margin of 19.1%, up a 140 basis points; EPS $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year, it was another encouraging quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4% including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points.", "Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses, and a lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from Financial Services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.3% as compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 140 basis points to 19.1%.", "Financial Services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%; and the operating margin of 22.9%, increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago.", "Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.", "Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%, excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2%, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset, by mid-single digit increases in the segment's Asia/Pacific and power tools operations and a low-single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business.", "Gross profit in the C&I Group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year.", "Turning now to slide eight. Second quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points, largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.", "Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of $25.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase program.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year.", "Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels, excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as mid-single digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships.", "Gross profit of $137.8 million compared to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods.", "Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives.

Well, that's the Snap-on second quarter; continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel, and expanding with repair shop owners and managers.

King & Associates, Inc.", "Could you maybe just talk about the overall industry backdrop for the automotive aftermarket, doesn't seem to have that much of an impact on your quarter, but just specific to weather and whether you saw any mechanics or end-markets that were backing off on tool purchases somewhat in the quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Not really. I mean, I think, look \u2013 I think, every quarter is different and there are ups and downs in every quarter in terms of the growth and in terms of the types of products that sell and so on, big ticket was very strong. I was just on a van within \u2013 just a little over a week ago and the franchisees and the garages we visited were all very, very optimistic. So I didn't get any feeling from that, from an anecdotal point of view. And then, during the quarter, I met with our \u2013 a group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so on and they seemed uniformly positive.", "And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now, for a long time. So empirically with the numbers and anecdotally from what I get from talking to franchisees and technicians, I think this is pretty positive.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And focusing on the Tools Group, maybe just talk about some of the higher-priced electronics versus traditional tools and power tools, maybe how that trended in the quarter?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, big ticket items. What we've \u2013 diagnostic sales were strong in the quarter for the Tools Group. We \u2013 you have kind of a secular trend in the market, what I characterize in my remarks is a tailwind, the need for more diagnostics because 40% to 50% of repairs in the parts today need a diagnostic to effect it efficiently and new cars are 80%, so there is a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic, we see that in our everyday sales and the trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big ticket items were fairly strong, high value, some of the things I talked about high-value tools that attack precision like the Brutus 300, strong-seller.", "So the idea \u2013 hand tools in fact were also up very strong. So we saw I think pretty wide strength, but again in this quarter, big ticket led the way. And that's what we expect, because our marketing age around Rock N' Roll Cabs and we've just done a major refurb on the Techno-Vans have kind of support those purchases.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L.

Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "For your information, for example, you can look at it this way. In the second quarter, the numbers were in sales, we had about $16 million and $0.09 of currency impact between transaction and translation. In this quarter, we had $10 million and $0.07, $10 million \u2013 just north of $10 million and currency in sales. And I think that's 1.2% or something like that and about $0.07 of currency impact on profitability, 50 basis points in the OI, impacting the OI margin.", "If you go forward, if everything stayed where it is, for us the pound is a big \u2013 is kind of a big deal. So I think you would say that in the third quarter, the comparisons are such that there would be a slight easing if everything stayed the way it was and then the fourth quarter would get easier I think for us, so that's the way we'd see the year going on, an easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, primarily because of the pound and the pound does carry uncertainty around the exchange rate today and anyway in that situation. But if it stays the way it is today, that's how it'll be.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up, sales that are bound by the pound, what percentage of your total sales are coming from that region?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "About 8%...", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "8% or 9%.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "About 8% or so. And no one knows what the \u2013 what Brexit is going to do. The roll up to Brexit was I think a time of uncertainty. We didn't really see much change, but we're selling into a very basic critical industry, so our people are going to \u2013 I think our people buy. We've even see it. So on a deep recession, people bought the small \u2013 the low payback \u2013 the short payback items, even in the deepest of recession. So it remains to be seen what effect Brexit will have, but we're optimistic about it. Okay?", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Got you.

Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "It was up more in profitability. We're pretty encouraged by that though. Like I said, it's the 13th straight quarter growth. And what's really encouraging I think is the growth in core Europe. We haven't seen growth in the core of Europe like this before uniformly. So I am a little encouraged by U.K., Germany and places like that. France, it was encouraging for SNA Europe.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "And then, the previous caller asked a question about currency. Did you say that currency comparisons for the pound should get easier as we go through the back half of the year?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I said \u2013 what I said, well, hard to predict, you know. I mean, the thing is \u2013 and you got the cocktail of what you sell and all that stuff. But if all things remain equal, what will happen is, is that currency in general will get \u2013 currency in general, the pound becomes more difficult I think as you rollout through the year, but then the other currencies abate. So if you look at the total, it gets \u2013 if everything stays the way it is, and the mix stays the way it is, you end up having a little softening in the third quarter and more softening in the fourth quarter. I think that's the way to think about it.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Nicholas T.

Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No. We don't comment on the forward quarter, but I don't really think so. I mean, certainly I'll say this, there was a lot of uncertainty in the \u2013 going \u2013 I was in Europe just before the Brexit vote and there was a lot of uncertainty floating around, around that and we didn't see it impact then, I don't know what will happen going forward. But again, I say, we sell items that solve critical tasks, that tends to be less effective by the economics. It can go up and down in a short period, but I think over time, it doesn't get affected. So I don't really think we expect in that situation.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "If the exchange rate changes dramatically that would have a transactional effect of course. If it affects the interest rates that would have another thing around other than \u2013 in other parts of the corporation, but I don't really \u2013 we didn't see anything so far.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "And then in terms of the Snap-on Credit, it keeps growing in excess of the sales of the Tools Group, are you seeing more of an appetite or are more products being financed by the technician that...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, not so much. Not really that. I mean the thing is fundamentally, what's happening in the Tools Group, if you look at it from our perspective and we look at it, you can't look at any one quarter because there is a secondary market and there is a lot of \u2013 that's actually the franchisee sales not our sales, so it doesn't match up. There is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at overall the last year, the originations are roughly the same as the sales of the big ticket items. So it's being driven by the sale of those big ticket items. And if you've been a student of Snap-on, you know that we have been energizing big ticket sales through we think better product of course in diagnostics and tools storage, but also in terms of the marketing, in terms of the marketing, the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno-Vans.", "So if I didn't know anything, I would say Snap-On puts Rock N' Roll Cabs and Techno-Vans in it and makes clear cold boxes, I'm going to see high originations because it's going to have a higher big ticket sale.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Nice quarter, Nick.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thank you.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just talking about the growth though in the Tools segment, you guys peaked out in the first quarter of 2015 at about 13% organic growth. And just because of the comping process, obviously that's not a sustainable level and you're going to be coming down. But that organic growth has been sort of settling back down for six consecutive quarters now; you're back to 5.8% this quarter. You talked many times in the past about the long-term growth in the Tools segment, it's probably closer to about 4%. And I just wonder, are we on our way back to that kind of level here in the second half of the year or is there something -?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I think, what I said is \u2013 I'll say \u2013 I'll make two comments about that. One is, is that, all through \u2013 there has been periods when we grew it like 6% or 5%. During the string of 23 out of 24, I think a year before in 2013, I think, we grew it like \u2013 we threw a bunch of 6%s during that period. So it goes up and down. This is a risk fluctuation.", "I've said this, I think \u2013 look, I think the Tools Group goes in the 4% to 5% range if based on the tailwind. It's got \u2013 that's a great market, automotive repair is the market, one of the market \u2013 in our model is one of the business models that Saturn (44:59) automotive repairs, one of the great, great markets, you've got tech \u2013 you've got aging of the part and you've got changing its technology, you've got more precision and that will drive us in a 4% to 5% range and things like Rock N' Roll Cab and Techno Express in the system program drives us up into higher levels depending on how effective that unleashes these \u2013 how much more effective that makes the van business. So from time-to-time, we get above this. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends on our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter so I think that's how I view it.", "I think we were at a solid 4% to 5%. But I think if we can keep coming up with ways to amplify our business, the technicians are there. There's 1.3 million technicians, we're calling on 850,000 of them, so a lot of them we'd be hiring every year. So we see a great market there. The other thing I will offer about the quarter, yeah, it was 5.8% but 18.3% OI margins.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "The incremental margins were fantastic and you said...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Try to find one of those in the Tools Group history.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. But...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Now, it's again 80 basis points.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right. Could you...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "So I guess the less than 6% sales and 7% sales didn't affect the profit \u2013 so they're still bringing the money...", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "... to the bottom line.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And you've said repeatedly that during that period of superb growth that you're not too focused on costs, you're more focused on just bringing in the business. But at some point that growth would ease and that's where we will see the margin improvement, just there was a lot of low-hanging fruit.", "I guess, which is part of why I asked the question, and now you're starting to see the margin growth which would confirm as a milestone that maybe we're at that point where the growth starts to ease. But you also said earlier in the call that you're still seeing strong double-digit growth in originations and originations attracts big ticket. So I guess the question I would next ask is what's easing within Tools, what do you see that if big tickets are holding up, what's easing on you?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, look, I didn't say in the quarter that was \u2013 I didn't match the double-digit growth of big ticket to the \u2013 or double digits of originations in the quarter, because you can't do that. You got to look at it over a longer period. So what I did say was the double digits in 2000 \u2013 of originations in 2015 maxed, almost pretty close to dead-on the big ticket items in 2015. In any quarter, it's hard to say that. I don't think in the quarter, the more robust businesses were around diagnostics, around hand tools. I think we had a dynamite hand tool quarter, but maybe we had a possibly less of a power tools quarter than we did in the prior quarter, that's the kind of characteristic we had. So we had some goes-ins and goes-outs, if you want to look at it by product.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah. And you're not adding any more tech or Rock N' Roll Cab Express, so I presume that the storage part of this is starting to level out a little as well, is that correct?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No. Yeah, yeah. But we actually did add one in the quarter. So went from 66 to 67, I mean, okay, it's not much. Look, I don't \u2013 I think it's one quarter. I'm not saying that \u2013 I'm not \u2013 we don't give any guidance, I'm just saying it's one quarter, so I think it's a little wrong to explain to view it totally as what were the mix in one quarter and, will tool storage go down, I don't think so.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Last question was just you talked on the last call about extending a little more credit to your most discerning franchisees, guys with the strongest track record at dispensing credit. And I'm just wondering where did that credit get put to work in the quarter and where does that show up in the segment numbers, if in fact it did get put to work?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "It shows up in the originations and in the Tools Group, those are the big ticket items. Those guys are wielding big ticket items. So that's part of the support system that allows us to sell those big ticket items. I mean big ticket is basically \u2013 and it has been for Tools, this has been 30 years of this or 50 years, I don't know how long, but it's been since the 1980s at least that they have been and I think longer that they've been financing big ticket items in this way. And what we did, as you said, is \u2013 what we did was just bring striking to the franchisees where we listen more to some guys and listen less to other guys depending on the record to call in the air strikes about appropriate credit. And in the quarter, that kind of \u2013 I think in the quarter, that kind of was relatively stable. But over like the last 18 months, we've had \u2013 we strike more guys that have been better at credit, and they've been able to aid the credit process more effectively.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bret Jordan at Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah, good morning.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Just to follow-up your comment on the secondary market in the \u2013 on the credit side, I'm just sort of trying to line up the growth in the finance book relative to the growth of sales. Has anything \u2013 and I guess we've decided that there is not an increase in penetration of credit on a transactional base, so you're not lending at a higher rate. It's been more a growth of high-value sales, but then you had a comment about the secondary market sort of creating some volatility there. Is that when your lending on a transaction where a franchisee is selling a used tool they took on trade?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah. Let's take it this way. Yes, that's essentially what it is. But what I meant was, what I offered that comment for is, it's harder to take one quarter's numbers in origination and relate it from originations, the credit action to the actual sale, which is a movement of product from us, from Snap-on Tools to the franchisee. The product moves from Snap-on Tools to the franchisees, it might go into inventory, it might sell directly, and it might ignite say, okay, I've sold you this, Mr. Big Box, it's like 15-feet wide and I took your 7-foot box in trade and I'm selling that, both transactions would be financed.", "And so while the net, you get a discount from the original for the amount in trade and then that would be on. So the total amount tends to be sort of the same. The timing of those two things can be very different. So a franchisee might end up in his garage, might have three boxes, used boxes waiting there, and then one quarter might roll them all out, might find a seller for them (51:53), you see what I mean. And so...", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Yes, I do.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "...that tends to distort the timing, not the amount, but the timing.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then back on the Tools, on the contribution from RCI versus leverage, did you discuss sort of what the RCI impact was in the prepared remarks, I didn't hear it?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure. I mean, the Tools Group is more or less like this. The OI margin is up 120 basis points and they had 80 basis points of negative currency. The principal offset is RCI.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then one question on C&I. You talked about U.S. aviation and power generation being highlights. Did you say anything \u2013 are you seeing any shifting trends? I mean, energy was a category you used to call out as being challenged? Is there any sign of improvement in some of the other big pieces like energy or mining that have been lagging in C&I?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, mining, I don't think so. Energy, generally, oil and gas is still lagging, but not by the mammoth proportions we saw in the in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. So that came back a little bit. That got better. And for C&I in general, as we go into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we start to get into, I'll say less demand in comparisons in military and in international aviation as well. So you see that kind of effect going on.", "In terms of the quarter-to-quarter business, we saw \u2013 I think we saw rays of hope in places like U.S. aviation and power generation. And general industry seemed to be fairly nice in the quarter. So we're encouraged by that, but I'm not \u2013 given the fact that we're down 2% in the quarter and down more in the critical industries, I'm reluctant to predict any turnaround until I actually see it.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then one final question on RS&I, just to cover all the bases. In the mix of software versus hardware, are you seeing a shift where you've got this great penetration of diagnostics in your selling software upgrades and that's increasing as a percentage of the mix or is that business kind of stable? It would seem like the software margin should be pretty good.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Software margins are pretty good, but I'd say in the quarter, it was relatively stable. From time to time, we can see a bump from software based on, we'll issue 18.4 (54:38), will come out in a quarter and that will bump the software sales. But generally, I would say our software sales go up with the general push of diagnostics. Remember, we tend \u2013 when we're looking at RS&I, we're looking at the sales we show you have quite a bit of software in it in Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 is a pure software business. Repair shop information and repair shop management, that's where that SureTrack business is.", "Generally though I don't think we've seen a big change in the mix yet. It might be entitled to the idea that going out future as we get more installed base, you may see some improvement in that. I tend to think as we get more installed base, we'll see both because people will buy in first. The entry-level technician will buy in at the bottom level for that ETHOS. And then when he starts to get more experience, who want to trade up and buy both software and hardware as he trades up.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. So the penetration rate of hardware is still growing. It's not just...", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, we don't.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "You don't have a cycle where you get to sell a lot of \u2013 a very high-margin software to a large installed base of hardware?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, we eventually will. I mean, but I think now, we're still seeing a growing of the penetration.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. All right.

So when you look at spending levels in those two businesses as we head into this year's Q3, do you think you could actually get to the point where the comparisons flip around and C&I reports a positive comp in Q3?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, as I said, I think the comps get easier. Clearly, the military comp gets easier, the international aviation comp gets easier, the oil and gas comp kind of is starting to get easier now. So I think those get better. Whether I can predict the turnaround in the military business, the oil and gas business, or the Middle East loosens up, hard to say. They do loosen up and I think you see favorable comps.", "I mean, like I said, I am positive about our mechanism there, our proof-of-concept. We keep investing in those businesses. If you look at the C&I SG&A or OI this quarter, you see quite a bit of investment, that's because we invested in Asia, we kept investing in these markets because we believe in them. So we obviously believe a turnaround, whether that's a third quarter or not is another question, but these comparisons do get softer.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. And then shifting back to the Tools Group, not to belabor this question, but growth slowed more than two points sequentially and your comparisons versus a year-ago got easier. So by saying that hand tools were good in the quarter and big ticket items were strong in the quarter, there just seems to be a missing link in the equation that would explain why growth ultimately did decelerate?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, as I said, I don't really want to go through all the items, but the power tools is down and so on. I don't necessarily recognize that the comparison was necessarily soft versus last year. I'm not really sure about that. But the thing is, is that, from our view, we're not seeing \u2013 all I can say is, we're not seeing anything in the market that's a difference. And so the 5.8%, yeah, it's down from the 8.1%, but we still see it as a pretty strong quarter and we don't have any other view of the future of the Tools Group or the auto repair market based on that.", "In terms of how the numbers, how the numbers work out, like I said, big ticket, still strong, sold better than the average, hand tools are sold better than the average. The other ones were \u2013 obviously if you talk about arithmetic, they were lower than the average.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Fair enough. My last question, with Fortive being its own company, Matco has been a little more visible and it looks that their van count has grown pretty dramatically in recent years, but it doesn't really seem to be diluting Snap-on's growth at all. And so is it the case where the two of you or really the three of you in this market co-exist? Is there any deterioration or things that you're concerned about, just maybe an update on the competitive dynamics?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, the science of Danaher are strong managers. And so Fortive is a formidable competitor with Matco and so is MAC. But I haven't heard their names mentioned on the last several \u2013 in many, many van rides now. So \u2013 and including the last one, which was just a little while ago. So we don't seem to be seeing them and pinging on them. Whatever they are doing, they are doing it invisible to most of our people. I tend to think people decide to buy Snap-on Tools as they look at others. They make that choice. It's kind of a binary decision. You buy Snap-on because that's the best. If you don't, if you don't, if you don't want that, you look at a bunch of others.", "Generally if you think about the numbers of people that we have in the field, the 3,487 vans and versus the \u2013 even the advanced Matco numbers, we're \u2013 our people are much more focused and spend more time with the certain amount of customers and calling those customer bases. The Matco and MAC guys chew a lot more dirt.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Very good. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yes.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Kratcoski, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks everyone for joining us today.

Nick?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone.", "As usual I'll start with the third quarter highlights providing update on the environment, and speak about some of our trends. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financial.", "In the third quarter we again showed progress along our runway for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segment. Total reported sales were $834.1 million up 1.5% and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency.", "It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6% and the OpCo operating margin it was up 140 basis points reaching 18.9%.", "When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings and financial services and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015 but consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24 a double digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year.", "Let's consider the environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable and we believe our Tools Group and our Repairs Systems and Information or RS&I Group, they're both well positioned to take full advantage of that opportunity. The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North America and European markets continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet.", "At RS&I serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mix. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop was up mid single-digit. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space was down. Under car equipment was flat with variations from product line to product line.", "For Commercial and Industrial or C&I the group was up organically 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across its market. The industrial business was flat reflecting the challenges we\u2019ve seen now for a year.", "Significantly however the critical industry activity recorded the second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than year of decrease, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military and the Middle East. Now there will always be headwinds across our operations.", "They\u2019ve been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter but we did overcome, we did see it growing because we\u2019re well positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding with repairs shop owners and managers, expanding to critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent our growth strategy and we continue to make progress along those quarter.", "At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or as we call it RCI. Together these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement and improvement is written all over our results especially customer connection, understanding the works of professional technician and innovation matching that insight with technology to make work easier.", "Snap-on value creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with two MOTOR magazine top 20 and with five professional tool and equipment news or P10 innovation award. Those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products born out of insight, of the insight of our franchises and our direct sales people, transplanting workplace observations into productivity solution and in the quarter those customer connections were a big factor in our results.", "To see some of that let's move to the individual groups. Commercial and Industrial, organic sales is up with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.3%, the benefit of Snap-on value creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industry.", "One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ five pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in a popular Snap-on PWZ series. It\u2019s a long 41.34 in inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for stronger and more secured grip on objects of all sizes and the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and in those cramped corners.", "It\u2019s perfect for applications on tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach in industries like railroad, oil and gas, for serving fleet, actually any heavy duty application. You heard me speak about in the past about our growing industrial product line. Well this wrench is another great ignition to our handful line up for critical industries.", "Now SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth navigating some difficult geographies and some taped economies. SNA sales activity continues to be positive but its profits are even more encouraging now up for 14 straight quarters and we believe there is still more opportunity.", "And the Asia Pacific operation mixed environment across the region, we continue to invest in building our physicals and the Asia operation has gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I.", "Now on to the tools. Organic sale is up 5.6% significant growth both in the U.S. and international and the internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015, the operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.8%.", "Volume gains as well as operating improvement from RCI translated into a significant margin rise and that 150 basis point gain it over attained 60 basis point of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Groups\u2019 success you can see the power of Snap-on value creation of customer connection and innovation. The MOTOR Top 20 and the P10 award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications but also awards from the professionals that use our tools every day. Innovation is consistently innovation, it\u2019s consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group and in the third quarter more new products.", "Like our reversible ratcheting combination wrench, the latest in the line of a Snap-on wrench of adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism utilizing our dual 80 technology combining dual pulls with thin walls, box end designs, smooth operation, more torque transferring tight basis and a port it incorporates the iconic Snap-on plank drive profile biting into fasteners without rounding corners preventing slippage.", "The new reversible ratcheting combo wrench it\u2019s more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop. Take the new 20 millimeter 12-point impact socket born from hours of observations in the workplace, hours of observation at workplace.", "This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inaccessible and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners a unique combination. It\u2019s produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it\u2019s essential for servicing large off road equipment. It may not be needed often but when it is it\u2019s critical and Snap-on has it. It\u2019s just another example of our commitment to make work easier solving our technician\u2019s most challenging problem.", "In the third quarter it\u2019s also when hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference or SFC. This year it was in Orlando with more than 8,700 attendees franchisee and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities, the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel and I can report to you because I was there that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees it was big success in orders because we orders at these events and orders while they were up once again beating the record levels of 2015.", "Now when we speak of the wrench, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on credit. Our financial services are on help to create opportunities across the organization but especially within the Tools Group it\u2019s been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years and our credit company had a strong presence at this year\u2019s SFC supporting franchisees with unique program. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000 about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contract enabling those big ticket item. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that.", "Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating market of 25.1%, it increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned RS&S clearly show progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent show owners and managers. And certainly a portion of that growth came from innovative new product several launch at the SFC. Product like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and Code Scan capability that allows the Tech to scan all of the vehicles computer system with the systems with the push of a single button.", "It also contains fast excess oil change and recent information, automatic vehicle identification and are unique SureTrack expert database. All features specifically designed to save the technician significant time.", "This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter and simply based on the excited crowds of franchises at the SFC that carved out precious time to a 10 MODIS Edge handheld training. We expect this to be a very popular item.", "Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager, this completely new Snap-on offering a breakthrough and pinpointing drop with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a referenced library of nominal and respect thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in break, emission system and in vehicle electrical equipment.", "We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and autos at the SFC prove it, its sold out. And RCI innovation wasn\u2019t just an diagnostic product. Take the brand new polytech air conditioning unit from our recent acquisition eco technique. Develop and manufacture specifically for the North American market meeting a very aggressive launch both our US and our Canadian customers have a firm strength of the units designed performance. Its been our real testament to the capability of the eco techniques team.", "And speaking of products, I\u2019m getting more to sell to repair shop owners and managers. This week we entered into a definite agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe.", "Car-O-Liner product offering in its special expertise are important editions to the Snap-on team providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repairs at segment were changed now authoring opportunity.

Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the US dollar or currency moment adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition related sales.", "Organic sales increased 2.6% reflecting pretty good progress and serving the vehicle repair sector as well as well as improvements in sales in our commercial and industrial segment.

Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations.", "Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat and the decline to the aerospace market segment was largely offset by gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments.", "Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved what we had seen earlier in the year.

", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Thanks Aldo.", "Stepping back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter; we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past that followed the different trajectory that new car sale. It was reliable even in the withering discussion of 2009 and strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter and you can see it in a result. ", "Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchises were prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin up 150 basis points against 60 basis points of unfavorable currency. The credit company continue to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner and enabling franchises and technicians as it has done for five decades to recession after recession without disruption. ", "RS&I selling to repair shop owners and managers mixed growth in uncovering the usual ups and downs of OEM sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shot, both independent and dealers. And C&I a mixed turbulence but now growing again, showing year over year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros and despite the difficult macros registering operating margin of 15.1% up 80 basis points.", "Showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as run rate of coherent growth. And finally in the result you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation more new product driving gains and the engine of rapid continues improvement offering efficiency, it all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an optical operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis point and an EPS of $2.22 and increase of 12.1% a double digit gain again.", "And the Car-O-Liner acquisition giving us more to sale, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for the Snap-on value creation to drive progress. The great opportunity. It was an encouraging quarter and we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond. ", "Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll keep directly to our franchises and associates. I know that many of you are listening or will listen to this call. Once again you should know that the encouraging performance of our corporation is only possible because of your capability, your energy and your dedication. For your extraordinary contribution to our progress you have my congratulations and for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird.", "Joe Vruwink", "Hi, good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. I wanted to discuss the deceleration in origination growth this quarter. So maybe for context, can you revisit the driver of the double-digit origination growth, that has been seen in recent quarters? And then maybe comment on whether demand conditions or other items change for those same drivers, or those same products in the current quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Sure. Look, a couple of things, first of all big ticket the idea of Snap-on tool storage and diagnostic were strong in a quarter, in fact stronger than - so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth and incidentally this is side hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principle driver for these things.", "Secondly and the reason that is the case. Reason why big ticket has been the case it's because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and number of used features and number of great attractive product that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to - I guess caliber off to have better and bigger diagnostic take care of those products.", "It's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just a consequence of our investment in the marketplace and as the kinds of product we've had and the demand to the market associated - the shift in the market associated with more diagnostic.", "And also our investment in enabling event that breakthrough the original structural barriers of the bands that is the space and time the Rock n Roll CADs which we talked about quite a bit which helped tool storage and the Techno band we have 67 of them now. In a Techno band we have 49 of them and that drive fairly robust bigger ticket items sale.", "In terms of higher-double digit before - double digit origination before and somewhat less originations now, you can't trade quarter-to-quarter, because there isn\u2019t a perfect one-to-one correlation. Remember that when you are looking at originations you are looking at franchisee sales. When you are looking at the Tools Group you are looking at our sales. We sell for the franchisees but the timing is different then you have on top of that the franchise margin and then we have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or diagnostic sale may ignite the couple of trading type sales which would also be somewhat supported by the credit card.", "So, you put those all together and that shows the landscape, but when we step back and we look at the say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about origination and the Tools Group big ticket sale, they seem pretty much the same. And this year we start to see year to date the same kind of thing.", "Joe Vruwink", "So I'm sure you know, in the market, there seems to be this idea that tools group growth is only strong because origination growth is strong. This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth, stable quarter over quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category may be strengthened quarter over quarter, or this whole relationship of painting tools group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "This is the most accurate. The tools group is a strategic partner- I mean the credit company is the strategic partner of the Tools Group. But if you think about it, yes, okay, but only 270,000 of our 875,000 customers, they have a credit company contract that's only about 30%.", "So if you think as a Tools Group growth been driven exclusively by the credit company mojo, think again. It just isn\u2019t that wide, of course, it is grown because the market has - the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product and also part of the way we figured out how to enable the band has been associated with that segment.", "But it's a natural thing, I've been talking about the Rock n Roll CADs for multiple quarters and that would naturally of course drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay?", "Joe Vruwink", "And then my last question if I can, the comps are difficult, so to do the growth you did this quarter was positive. I'm just thinking, you took 3,000 routes down intra-quarter for the franchisee conference. Is there any indication based on vans coming back online, and your order activity, that\u2019s the pace of sales you got strength in year-over-year in the Q4?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I am not in the business of projecting out. I'll only say this is what I said on the call, look. The Franchisee Conference was baffled. It was really good and the enthusiasm was good, so I can tell it anecdotally or anybody was there was talking anecdotally I'm just with the national franchises, the National Franchise Advisory report and they are all positive. And quantitative piece is the orders were up, it was up over the record that we set last year at the SFC.", "Now they don\u2019t translate one to one in sale, they were up significantly. It doesn\u2019t translate one to one, but what it says is our guys saw the new product they were confident in the future they invested and they ordered so they think good things are coming.", "Joe Vruwink", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good morning Nick, good morning Aldo. Aldo, in your prepared statement, maybe you can answer, you talked about the physicals, the investment in emerging markets of C&I. Are you seeing any kind of significant revenue growth there to begin absorbing that upfront investment?", "Aldo Pagliari", "The emerging markets tend to have their own volatility and lumpiness so to speak for lack of a better word but we believe that the secret to penetrating the emerging markets is to establish physical presence, people, place, products that suite those market and those environments. So through thick and thin we\u2019re continuously looking for opportunities to expand our footprint because we know that what we\u2019ve today could still be improved upon. So that\u2019s basically our philosophy when it comes to that Liam.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We\u2019re investing in things like more Blue-Point stores, more products. You are trying to expand your product line and more sales outlets. For example we just opened another sales outlet in Vietnam this quarter. So that\u2019s the kind of investment we\u2019re doing because in the 11 years I lived in Asia I know I am confident that the building of the physical allows you to take advantage of the market as it matures.", "Liam Burke", "And, same with C&I, on the new product introductions, you talked about that being a big driver of incremental growth. Are there any particular verticals that you, this quarter, saw opportunity to put new product into the market?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Well, we had - we talked about couple of those. I mean I think in this particular market the natural resources we\u2019ve been - I can only say that actually we\u2019re trying to play the long game in C&I. We believe we\u2019re trying to build our activity in each of these markets.", "So for example, not in this particular quarter because we wouldn\u2019t make product adjustment for a quarter. We see opportunities, we build out \u2013 our goal was to build up in each of the markets. For example last year we brought out 929 new products just for aviation, 313 for oil and gas even though it was, we\u2019re having probably one of the most difficult times, 313 for military even though it was a difficult time.", "So we just keep addition not so much targeting. Now we still have some great opportunities they are still on heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that\u2019s been a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual control system, our tool control system which we\u2019ve seen now. Amazingly we\u2019ve seen the tool control system more and go bleed into oil and gas.", "We have a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed when we had been using it just for aviation. We can see it rolling into railroad with small enhancements. That\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re doing.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thanks Nick, thanks Aldo.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "Good morning everyone. Congratulations Nick, on a good quarter. The question is on the tools group and your margin is up 150 basis points, including 60 BPs of negative FX. You have come through a period where you have a period of hypergrowth, as that term might be applied to this particular category. That growth seems to be slowing now.", "Obviously, there is a lot of cost opportunity that is out of reach when you're getting that kind of growth, but now the growth is easing a little bit. Maybe that cost opportunity becomes more accessible. The question is how sustainable are these year-over-year margin progression numbers, given that you now have a cost of opportunity you might not have had for the last couple of years?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think there is some truth in what you say there, I don\u2019t think you can predict quarter by quarter in this kind of situation. Of course one is with your eyeballs are looking for trying to double-digit growth that kind of things you maybe perhaps have some efficiency opportunities but we like to believe we take full advantage of those kind of things.", "I think though if you look at our overall number, if you look at the OI margin growth for the corporation and you take a look at the year-over-year OpCo margin and you go back and see it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s been triple-digits on awful lot of times awfully far back in peak sales growth and small sales growth.", "So I think we\u2019ve been able to grow that margin in a lot of different situations on an overall basis. Now in the situation at Tools Groups it does give you a little more advantage, little opportunity to look at that but I wouldn\u2019t allow the characterization that 5.6% is low. I think that\u2019s pretty good growth. I mean we\u2019re taking about 5.6% organically in GDP that are throwing between 1 and 2 all over the world. So I think it\u2019s pretty good.", "David MacGregor", "If I could just follow-up with a couple of other quick ones.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes.", "David MacGregor", "The slower growth in the origination, how much of that was just the flat under car?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Say that again please.", "David MacGregor", "The slower growth in originations I am just wondering how much of that might have been due to lack of growth in under car.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much. I mean the thing is that of course there some under car equipment that gets sold in to the Tools Group space but just primarily when you\u2019re talking about the origination, the primary driver is tool storage and the second driver is the big ticket diagnostics. So it\u2019s not real. There is some of it in there floating around but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much of a factor.", "David MacGregor", "Okay, last question, I know you are going to market through your franchisees but you have a pretty substantial distribution arrangement as well. Was de-stocking within your distribution partners \u2013 how much of a growth inhibitor was that in the quarter?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I am sure there was some of it but I\u2019d have to say it might have been, it would have shown up in the industrial business that was flat like I said it was up sequentially which gave us some positives. I don\u2019t think it was huge factor this quarter, it might been some evolving.", "David MacGregor", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.", "Tom Hayes", "Good morning gentlemen. On the RS&I group, Nick, your organic growth rates have been bouncing around the last couple of quarters. I wanted a little bit of clarity digging into that a bit. Maybe the route trajectory of the diagnostic equipment, versus the undercar that is in there as well.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, look, like we said in the I think the statements, the formal statements is that diagnostic information and products and diagnostics so that will be like Mitchell and diagnostics the software and the handheld hardware to independent repair shop owners and managers were up mid single-digit and it\u2019s been up. That kind of number gee I think every quarter for a long time. I can attest to it exactly but I think that in most quarters it\u2019s has been bouncing around mid to high single-digit.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "So I think that\u2019s doing pretty well. The big thing about diagnostics at this time I mean, not diagnostics but RS&I this time as I tried to make clear in the quarter we have this business in RS&I which produces, which takes contracts, OEM commission contract to distribute where you could talk potential tools or facilitate a project. So for example you might have somebody\u2019s Aldo referred to this to do some air-conditioning, provide an air-conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers.", "One of the manufacturers is like, I want you to provide this air-conditioning system, I want you to get it my dealers, I want it to be two per dealer and I want it to be rolled out in the next four quarters or three quarters. We rolled it out. That\u2019s a pretty big piece of sales. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on an new truck that rolls to in a quarter but what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEM and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models.", "So they tend to be quite lumpy and what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business this was kind of a strong quarter in that business and that created the overhang, one of the overhangs in RS&I.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay, and then on the\u2026", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "But the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good.", "Tom Hayes", "On the Car-O-Liner acquisition, that was roughly $95 million in revenue. Is that a little bit of geographic clarity, is that all Europe, or is that spread across?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "No, no. It\u2019s like about, it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s about 45% U.S. about 30% in Europe and the rest in the rest of the world but there is a big piece of that like 20 points or 25 points in Asia. That\u2019s the way it works. And the 275 people, 100 in the factories, 150 selling, 50 engineers and the rest to do in other thing.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. Lastly if I could for Aldo. Fourth quarter last year on the operating expenses it took a pretty big step down versus 3Q of \u201915. Is there anything in there that maybe you guys held back last year that we need to think about this year?", "Aldo Pagliari", "No I mean the top of mind you can think about the creates little bit of volatility if there is a changes in mark to market, it's depending on stock price one way or the other.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.", "David Kelley", "Good morning. This is David Kelley in for Bret. Just a quick follow-up on RS&I, and specifically the undercar business being flat. We have heard similar commentary from other aftermarket retailers and installers, and they mostly have been referencing the residual impact from last year's mild winter weather. Just thinking about some of the industry fundamentals and miles driven being up, it feels like it's a bit surprising that segment is still lagging. The question is, do you think there is some pent-up demand there, or some real opportunity for you as we lap last winter, and slowly inch to 2017?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know. For us the winter thing is a double-edge sword. I heard people say winter is tough and therefore we don\u2019t sale balances or we don\u2019t sale -- we don\u2019t do tire service, we'll service when winter is mild. So we don\u2019t do as much tire service. On the other hand I heard people say, yes, people are crashing into each other left and side there is lot of repair, we need more or less, we need more alignment going on. People are running into bumpers or bouncing into potholes.", "So it's a double-edge sword. I am not so sure, but I do think there is opportunity in our business. What we saw there was variation from product to product. We saw kind of stronger quarter and alignment and couple of the other product lines that are little bit weaker. We didn\u2019t really think it was very significant or indicative of anything actually for us. We do think there is opportunity for the equipment business going forward though because we like our product. ", "David Kelley", "Okay, great. So you don\u2019t see any real structural issue that for whatever reason undercars?.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think so. We don\u2019t see it anyway and we are in garage with every -- we have people in garage for hours every week.", "David Kelley", "Sure, sure. And a follow-up on the strong tools organic growth, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers there, the specific product segments that are just really outperforming as of late? Or even regional trends, are you seeing some specific region or part of the U.S.?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "There can be regional trends, but they tend to very quarter to quarter, they tell you the truth. The thing is I can tell you I was just with a bunch of franchises, and from all over the country this is the National Franchise Advisory conference, they all seemed positive. And they are representing the region.", "So I didn\u2019t run into a single person who was saying, this is tough. And we are saying that they were positive. At the SFC I can't emphasize enough, how important is it when people order more year-over-year. What is means is they are putting their money on the line, they are committing to taking products that they think things are going to positive, so they got a positive outlook.", "So we feel good about that. What's driving our business I think maybe three factors. One is our new products pretty robust. You heard me talk about couple of them for handtools. Handtools were up in the quarter, tool storage were up in the quarter, diagnostic were up in the quarter. We talk about that product line because I think about customer innovation is better than ever before. We have more products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchises are stronger. They are stronger and the despite the fact they are stronger they seem to be hungrier for more products.", "And thirdly, we've invested in things in the vans like Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Techno-Vans and our franchises are so confident that taking on system, so the model itself is getting better that another way it's a great market. Auto repair is a great market and like I said every quarter we know how to take better advantage to the opportunity. You can see it. ", "David Kelley", "Okay, great, thanks. One more for me, and thanks again for taking my questions, I will pass it along. You referenced the jump into the US collision market with the deal. How do we think about US collision here? My understanding is you didn't have a ton of exposure to that market, and I know the US collision sector from talking to the LKQs and Coparts of the world, has certainly been strong, and feels like it is going to be strong for the next few years. What do you think you opportunity is in U.S. collision?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "We like it for a few reason, one is we believe car liner is a great brand, but we smear the Snap-on over it even stronger. Secondly, this is a space which is changing, different materials are requiring different modes of collision repair. And car liner's the out front on that regards with their product line and our research and engineering can augment those 50 or 45 engineers at car liners to make them better. Thirdly, we think that repair start to become more important in collision shops because there is intelligent distributor around the car.", "You get a dent you got repair things and so we can bring the repair aspect the collision shops something no one else can do in this space. Our products in terms of our physical products and data base associated with repair. So we think it\u2019s a great coherent acquisition.", "David Kelley", "All right great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King.", "Scott Stember", "Good morning. Can you maybe talk about Brexit, your initial observations, whether you have seen any impact on the UK market? And either from a sales or a currency perspective? And then, maybe just to talk about your expectations for currency. It looks like we still have some headwinds. I know initially before Brexit there was a thought that later in this year, that the comparisons would start to flatten out. Can you maybe talk about those two things?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, look Brexit of course as I referred is a challenge for as part of the turbulence in Europe. But in fact if you look at the three pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group up strong in the U.K., you look at RS&I up nicely but you look at SNA Europe and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again I think it was the 12 straight quarter of growth. That was down slightly.", "So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit, it really would but generally overall volume it was great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better market. The problem is in the currency so it becomes a big liner in terms of - it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales because we have pretty good sales in pounds and secondly remember we\u2019re selling into the British market, selling in pound but we\u2019re making in dollars, we\u2019re making in United States. So we have a transitional impact.", "So if you step back and you look at our currency overall for the corporation that $2.22 it has $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of that was the UK. Of course there were some other factors in there. And then looking forward when you start at look at the UK kind of went down in the quarter so we think kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward we probably don\u2019t see as much pressure from translation but the profitability will be about the same maybe a little bit more impacted going forward because of the pound.", "Now going out beyond where are now. That\u2019s based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker it will impact us more. But that\u2019s the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor just the currency sensitive factor.", "Scott Stember", "Got it. And the last question on weather again, taking a different slant, the record warmth that we have had this summer, maybe for air-conditioning related products, have you seen any jump in demand for any tools that are related to any AC repair?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I am sure that happened but I can\u2019t you quote you any figures on that, I haven\u2019t sliced the tools by virtually AC repair. That is one of the thing that does happen. Every year there is a new story about that, it\u2019s a hard winter or short winter and people have different tools. The cool thing about Snap-on is, we have the widest product line, so whatever the conditions we have something to sell into those conditions.", "Scott Stember", "Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks so much for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.", "Gary Prestopino", "Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. Did you call out what the European hand tools business was up on a percentage basis this quarter, Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I did not but it\u2019s up mid single - I think maybe mid single-digit.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sorry go ahead.", "Gary Prestopino", "No, I was just going to say, that\u2019s about where it\u2019s been all year right.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes, it\u2019s been around that level, yes, it\u2019s been growing. I mean, it\u2019s still, I hate to say this but it\u2019s still got headroom. I mean it\u2019s still below where it was at its peak, maybe 15% or so below where it was but we think it\u2019s got headroom and the profitability 14 up straight quarters. We know that has a runway.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay.", "Aldo Pagliari", "That\u2019s a good thing for us.", "Gary Prestopino", "Right, okay, so good things for it. And then, could you give us some idea of what Car-O-Liner's growth has been historically, and where you think you can take that? Top line growth?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking backwards in terms of growth. We like to look forward and we see this as a kind of in the 5 plus vicinity, RS&I type. When you think of the RS&I type business growth that\u2019s where we see it, the 5 plus type business. I think it\u2019s a kind of a food errand to be true definitive looking forward but I can tell you that we think looking at it that\u2019s a solid projection.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. That is good. And then in terms of, it looks like year-to-date the corporate expenses are down about $13 million. Your SG&A is down as well. Is that all dealing with the pension expense on the market to market on the stocks?", "Aldo Pagliari", "It is Gary, the pension this year the way the accounting rules work we have a savings per quarter of about $1.9 million so you can multiply that by 3 and you get a year-to-date amount. And then the noise is created by how the stock price moves not just this year but remember you have to look at the movement relative to last year. For this particular quarter there is really no change of mark-to-market it\u2019s very benign. So most of the changes in corporate expenses this quarter is related solely to pension expense.", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "How we look at it the quarter is down I think year-over-year like 1.2 million something like that, 22.5 versus 22.7 but the penalty for currency was well more than offsetting that. That's good news out of pension. So we think we ended up on the short end of that combination.", "Gary Prestopino ", "Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard Hilgert", "Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everybody. All of my questions have already been asked, congratulations on a great quarter, good to see the continued improvement and the profitability across the group still, and still seeing that nice growth in the financial services area. And, appreciated that little bit of color earlier on the differentiation between what is going on in hand tools, and the growth in financial services.", "Just a final question remaining for me was, I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your intersegment number, on the breakdown for revenue with the segments, it has gotten a little bit larger, compared to history. It is running now above 14% number as a percentage of the total, of the segment revenues. And on an absolute basis, now up to $139 million. Just curious what is driving that and should we be expecting that percentage to be a higher amount of the total going forward?", "Nicholas Pinchuk", "Yes, no kidding, it will grow because of the Tools Group has been growing. If you think about it the Tools Group it\u2019s got its own factory but it\u2019s got that great distribution. So inside C&I there are factories like the power tools factory and so on like other places that sell, they sell externally but they also sell to the Tools Group SNA Europe does that, RS&I has some divisions that do that. We\u2019ve torque wrenches in C&I that do that do that out in California so sell in both places. So as the Tools Group grow, you will see inter-company sales grow, it\u2019s a natural outcome of that.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, great. Thanks you very much and again congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks everyone for joining us today.

Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. Along the way, we\u2019ll look at results, the markets, the progress we\u2019ve made and I\u2019ll give you a perspective on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financial.", "We believe that our first quarter has convincing confirmation of Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results to overcome period to period variations from business-to-business to offset macroeconomic headwinds and to still keep advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement.", "Our reported sales in the quarter of $887.1 million were up 6.3%, including $29.1 million in acquisition related sales, partially offset by $9.6 million in unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 4.1%, with increases registered by every group. Those gains together with continued contributions from Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, combined offer another encouraging quarter.", "Our EPS was $2.39, up 10.6% from last year\u2019s $2.16. The increase includes an opco operating margin of 19.1%, 50 basis points higher than last year and that rise overcame a 50 basis points unfavorable impact from acquisitions. When you combine those current opco gains with earnings of $52.5 million from the financial services, it brings Snap-on\u2019s consolidated operating margin to 23%, up from the 22.5% in 2016.", "Now let me pause here to note that these acquisitions may be margin attenuators at this point, but they\u2019re actually landscapes that are fertile ground for Snap-on Value Creation. As we go forward, they\u2019re actually great opportunities to achieve margin improvement \u2013 margin growth.", "Now let\u2019s look at the markets. We believe the auto repair market remains relatively robust. The Tools Group, organic sales growth somewhat lower than in previous quarters, but still positive, solving technician problems and making our franchise network more prosperous and more powerful.", "And in the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, another vehicle repair business, encouraging strength in the quarter, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line. Within innovative new tools like the digital thermal imager and new acquisitions like Car-O-Liner, all leading to growth in independent repair shops as well as OEM dealerships across the group.", "C&I, the businesses that served critical industries, a wide range of industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter, the results showed progress despite some challenged industrial sectors and some troubled geographies, and critical industries improvement in the natural resources segment overcoming the continuing economic turbulence in places like the Middle East and the impact on our international aviation business.", "At SNA Europe, mid-single-digit growth with strength in places like the UK, Spain, France, Italy, and the Nordic region, mitigating difficulties in Eastern Europe. And from our Asia Pacific division, solid increases in key countries like China and India.", "So overall, I described our C&I markets is improving. Challenges still exist, but we took advantage of the opportunities that were available, and we\u2019re encouraged by our advancements in the quarter. And those activities, together with our auto repair related businesses combined to drive overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the Van network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers extending to critical industry, building an emerging market. Advancements leveraging our widening product line and increasing our understanding of work, growth and critical sectors and important geographies. That\u2019s an overview of the markets.", "Now let\u2019s talk about the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 3%, with mid-single-digit growth in European hand tools business and low-single-digit rise in volume to our customers in critical industries. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.6 million representing an operating margin of 13.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points, which reflects higher investment spending for product development and engineering activities in that group.", "As part of C&I, we remain committed to extending in critical industries and we\u2019ll keep strengthening our position to capture new business opportunities in those areas as they arise.", "Along those lines, we\u2019ve seen some recent gains with natural resources customers, helped by our line of innovative new products, designed especially to make work easier in that uniquely challenging Industrial setting. Oil and gas can be tough, we have the products. One example is our collection of Snap-on 3/8\u201d drive torque adapters, manufactured in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant. It\u2019s a new product family, used in applications where access is difficult and precision is critical, and natural resources in mining on a variety of large earth moving equipments.", "Produced from special high alloy steel, precision-forged and especially heat-treated, these tools have a double hex 12-point that allows fasteners to be engaged every 30 degrees instead of the standard every 60 degrees, a feature that provides better angles for grip and easier operation in restricted areas. The adapter length, crucial for measuring torque is very precise and it\u2019s etched on the tool for easy reference. The new torque adapter family is a great addition to our lineup and it fills a vital need for our critical industry customers.", "Now I already mentioned SNA Europe\u2019s mid-single-digit organic sales growth. That progress was broad based across the landscape and including some, what I would say were fairly difficult regions and countries. SNA Europe\u2019s positive trend to performance now extends 14 straight quarters with year-over-year sales growth, and actually include 16 straight quarters of margin improvement. It\u2019s quite a record in a region that\u2019s marked by so much uncertainty.", "Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 2.5%, the operating margin was 17.2% \u2013 the operating margin of 17.2% was up 60 basis points versus the 16.6% recorded last year, and that\u2019s despite 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Let me say that again. 17.2%, up 60 basis points against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency.", "The Tools volume story simply put our Techno-Vans keep \u2013 kept coming \u2013 our Techno-Vans kept coming, but the Rock \u2018N Roll vans cabs were less effective and that big-ticket combination was less favorable than usual. We do believe however, that this runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel remains very strong and there\u2019s evidence of that strength of an ongoing positive trajectory across the Van channel.", "And our franchise metrics, the important financial and physical indicators that we monitor them very closely and again, this quarter, they remain favorable. There\u2019s also a testimony in our direct interactions with the franchisees, at events like this year\u2019s kickoff meetings, held all over the network.", "At the very recent meetings with the National Franchisee Advisory Council and at separate interactions with individual franchisees, all of these have been marked by enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, all of them, entrepreneurs and professionals are confident in reaching higher and optimistic regarding the upcoming opportunities and some of that enthusiasm rests on a new product that\u2019s rolling out to drive new excitement.", "For example, the great addition to our tool lineup is the Snap-on [indiscernible] 3/8\u201d drive ratchet. Again, manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, comes with a flexible head, extra long handle, better access in tight automotive applications and additional leverage within those that\u2019s what the long handles for, additional leverage within those cramped spaces.", "It\u2019s got a sealed head to keep lubricants in and contaminants out, and that bodes a longer life. And of course, it includes the Snap-on\u2019s patent. Our patented Dual 80 technology, featuring 80 teeth gear for minimum swing arch, and dual pawls for strength. You put this 80 teeth together, small swing and the arch, dual pulls make it strong, you got the long handle for leverage, a design for flexibility, strength and compact operation.", "We believe we\u2019ve got a great hand tool in our new 3/8\" extra-long flex head ratchet. And you heard me talk about hit products before. It will be one of this year\u2019s hit products. We\u2019re also rolling out a new tool storage program. A brand-new color, striking trim options, some great new promotions, we all know that tool storage activity thrives on excitement while our new package is aimed at creating that buzz and it\u2019s based on early reactions, it\u2019ll do the job.", "Also just recently launched was the Snap-on PT850 1/2\u201d drive impact wrench. It\u2019s a signature product, a top-of-the-line pneumatic offering that is a power of MG725, but providing more enhanced balance for comfort and control and durability. Comfort in a lighter weight package, better grip positioning for improved balance with ergonomic improvements to reduce fatigue when you\u2019re using it all day.", "Control, a compact design with a favorable trigger for applying the right torque for the job. Easy to control, even while wearing gloves in the shop. And durability, two-piece housing with an aircraft grade aluminum nose, solid steel impact mechanism, forged steel frame and hammers and a precision cast, hard coated aluminum cylinder. That\u2019s going to last for a long time.", "Made in our Murphy, North Carolina facility, a new Snap-On PT850 1/2\u201d drive impact, this is a great wrench, power, comfort, control and durability. These are the features our customers want in the power tool and early sales confirm that this tool is right on target.", "Now let\u2019s speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales rose 7.8%, with high single-digit gains registered pretty much across the board with diagnostics and information product independent shop with the business focused on OEM dealers and with undercar equipment. And on a reported basis, RS&I\u2019s $21.3 million acquisition-related and are reported basis including the group\u2019s, the RS&I\u2019s group $21.3 million of acquisition-related sales. First quarter volume rose 14.3% compared to last year.", "Operating earnings of $78.7 million increased $9.7 million from 2016, and operating margin of 24.7% was flat with last year, but with strong volume and RCI improvement, offsetting 140 basis points of negative impacts from the acquisitions. As I said before, fertile ground for margin improvement. We\u2019re clearly seeing the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions providing greater reach like in collision repair in Car-O-Liner\u2019s and new \u2013 really new capabilities and products for our team and they can wield them.", "RS&I\u2019s organic growth in the quarter was broad. It was broad based across every division. I just mentioned the progress with independent shop owners, and those gains were clearly evident in the ongoing success of our powerful MODIS Edge handheld and the spread of the digital thermal imager. It\u2019s becoming an essential product for top-flight mechanics.", "The rise can also \u2013 that rise, that gain can also be seen in our latest software release, which not only contains expanded new model coverage, but also incorporates additions like motorcycle information and enhanced key fob reprogramming. It\u2019s sold quite well and it\u2019s fortified our advantage in our clear advantage in comprehensive repair, people repair information.", "For undercar equipment, sales were up high single-digits. Contributing to that increase was RS&I\u2019s introduction of the smart speed tire changer, the new unit \u2013 this new unit incorporates Snap-on\u2019s proprietary and patented technology to minimize floor to floor or tech time needed to mount a tire. A big factor in shops was handling a lot of tires, and there and are quite a few of those high-volume locations.", "You can see them everywhere. Tires are more sophisticated and more difficult to change than ever. Low profile tires for example, make up 25% of the market and are growing and their rigid construction makes them more susceptible to handling damage and require much more \u2013 they require much more care during the tire changing process. Our smart speed systems eliminate a great deal of that risk.", "It continuously monitors the power to the motor and automatically selects the turntable speed at which the motor has the correct amount of torque, that mount the tire without harm and in the fastest time. We often speak of customer connection activities and observation in the workplace, gaining insights to make work easier for our customers. Well, repair shop owners and managers are continually seeking the highest possible throughput.", "We observe that tire damage by torque mismatch is a big contributor to delay in those shops. So for owners and managers, the smart speed tire changer that matches that torque to the tire, makes life easier and saves time and saves money. It\u2019s a great addition to the equipment line and initial customer feedback has been quite enthusiastic, really enthusiastic.", "Finally, RS&I got a real boost in the quarter by the increased activity from OEM dealerships, up high single-digits, driven in particular by several significant essential diagnostic and essential tool programs for large automotive, heavy duty trucks and agricultural OEMs. It appears as though the focus on repair across the industry continues to be robust.", "So those are the highlights of the quarter, overcoming headwinds, continued progress, organic sales rising 4.1%, gains that change through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, strengthening our businesses and driving to its 19.1% opco operating margin up 50 basis points overcoming the acquisition, and EPS of $2.39, up 10.6%. It was an encouraging quarter.", "Now let\u2019s turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $887.1 million in the quarter increased $52.9 million or 6.3% from 2016 levels, reflecting a $33.4 million or 4.1% organic sales gain, $29.1 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.", "Foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 130 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as further recovery in sales to Industrial market segments in our C&I Group. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $278.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.4% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points as operating expenses for acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage.", "As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $169.5 million, increased 9.1% and as a percentage of sales, improved 50 basis points to 19.1%.

As of quarter-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our first quarter. C&I with organic growth of 3%; OI margin, 13.9. SNA Europe, continuing its bellwether trends, sales up, profits up again industrial, critical industries coming back with broader gain. Tools up 2.5% organically, OI margin of 17.2%, up 60 basis points against the currency headwind of 70 basis points.", "RS&I Organic sales up 7.8% with increases across this customer base, each of its customer base.

And we believe as we\u2019ve said for some number of quarters that we\u2019re well positioned to continue that trend. Great new products are entering the mix, aimed at customer needs and customer excitement, all drivers of progress along our runways for growth. And Snap-on Value Creation continues to drive our runways for improvement. And now, we have new landscape for our acquisitions, providing expanded possibilities for further margin improvement.", "We believe we have abundant opportunity for both growth and improvement. And we believe we possess the capabilities and the intent to take full advantage and continue our positive trend going forward to 2017 and beyond.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019d like to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. The encouraging quarter we\u2019re announcing today reflects unique skill and commitments. For all your many contributions to our progress, you have my congratulations. And for all your extraordinary dedication to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Glynn", "Thanks good morning.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning", "Christopher Glynn", "Yes, just with the Tools Group, you\u2019ve had some deceleration recently, but the comparisons were pretty tough in the first quarter, and it starts to get a little easier. So right now, you\u2019re a little bit below what I think you\u2019d call normalized. Is there a reversion that based on the comparisons that you expect?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, look. We always say that we expect the 4% to 6% growth for our divisions and there could be variations from quarter-to-quarter. We never necessarily predict the reversion based on comparisons. This particular one was a difficult comparison that you said, I think the better thought is, look, we feel pretty confident about the new products we\u2019re rolling out.", "We\u2019re kind of pumped about the whole idea of the long handle ratchet and the new tool storage program and color and the excitement that will generate and the idea of the PT850 half inch impact, which is a signature tool, and everybody loves it. We like those. And so at the end of the day, it comes down to product, and we\u2019re kind of optimistic about that, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay, and then any update on franchisees, inventories and sell through against contracted sales to franchisees.", "Aldo Pagliari", "No, I\u2019d say the \u2013 we\u2019re in line with franchisee movements more or less. There\u2019s always some variation in the inventory levels, but pretty much in line and reflective of our sales.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, and that moves from time to time. That goes quarter-to-quarter, the franchisee sales particularly match ours. It really depends on how we\u2019re feeling in the programs and so on.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay. And then with the originations and sort of a flattening trend, but portfolio continues to grow, can you talk about any trend of restructuring or re-aging the loans and how you view that?", "Aldo Pagliari", "We don\u2019t restructure the loans. I mean, the loans stand by themselves and the originations, I think, largely reflect the pattern of what\u2019s being demanded in that channel and as Nick has mentioned earlier, our tool storage, which is the most popular product to be originated on the contract was not as robust the quarter in that regard.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay, great. And then just, do you have any data on the net charge-offs and the ending allowance?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes, they were up slightly. If you look at it year-over-year, but stable and actually on a sequential basis, we saw a bit of improvement over all. So again, somewhat stable trends in line what our expectations.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay thanks guys", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, good morning everyone.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning", "David MacGregor", "Yes. Good morning, Nick. A lot of good things this quarter. I wanted to just \u2013 I wanted to ask you about the storage and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s going on there with your assessment of the negative growth in storage. Is this demand easing? curtailed to credit availability with respect to this category?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. Sorry, I don\u2019t think actually, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. I mean, there always can be factors, from time to time. My assessment is first of all, tool storage has been growing a longtime. This quarter even though with the down, it\u2019s one of our top 10 quarters ever still in tool storage. But having said that, now we\u2019ve had two quarters of tool storage less than robust positioning, and we conclude, maybe it needs a little more excitement, maybe \u2013 at the end of the day, these are product-driven.", "And you roll out a product and some \u2013 if some of them are singles and doubles and some are home runs. And when we look at the tool storage in general, you might be tempted to say that we look at the tool storage offering across the network. It\u2019s down in 4 to 5 places where we have vans, and they aren\u2019t affected by any of those things that you\u2019re talking about, if you observe those markets over the years, they wouldn\u2019t be affected by, let\u2019s say, credit or so much by credit or by saturation. And so we conclude the tool storage line up just need a little goosing. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about this new program rolling out, new colors and so on. It\u2019s as simple as that, I think.", "David MacGregor", "As there been any change in the number of Rock \u2018N Roll Cap Expresses on the road?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No, we haven\u2019t change them. So that\u2019s another thought. I mean \u2013 but we \u2013 I tend to think it\u2019s for our \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 this tends to be \u2013 there is a lot of factors, David. And of course, everything I say isn\u2019t true everywhere. But the thing is, I think if you look across the networking and you see the behavior of tool storage and when it happens for two \u2013 for more than one quarter, it starts to get your attention. We say, \"Hey, let\u2019s accelerate a little goosing.\" And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.", "And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve encoded in the tool storage situation. It\u2019s not been ticked because diagnostics is rolling. Diagnostics is having a great quarter, had a great quarter, another great quarter. So that isn\u2019t it. It isn\u2019t the big ticket situation, just \u2013 and you see it from time to time. It doesn\u2019t show up so clearly, but when we look at it at a granular level, we see positives and singles and doubles and triples.", "David MacGregor", "I want to ask you about the acquisitions because hit you finally you got a lot of margin up side there, I guess I was going to ask you if you could just quantify your best guess on what the margin upside is? Do these acquisitions get back to kind fled average margins? Or could they surpass that? What\u2019s the upside?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I don\u2019t really want to speculate on that. All I know is we ought to moving them upwards. You\u2019ve got a year where they come in. You kind of have a year where they start to \u2013 their comparing to the year before where they weren\u2019t in the number, but then after that given you Snap-on Value Creation and so on, you expect to have that effect, start moving them upwards.", "And I don\u2019t know where the upside is I mean you got Car-O-Liner is there which is a kind of equipment level business, which is at the bottom of RS&I\u2019s \u2013 OI margin. Remember, RS&I is a variance of several thousand basis points. And so OI margins and equipment is at a sort of bottom end of that because it\u2019s hardware-based. And Car-O-Liner starts out a little bit lower than that. We think we got a lot of upside in those businesses. And so \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want to quantify it. I am just happy to get a good chunk every year.", "David MacGregor", "Did I hear you correctly?", "Nick Pinchuk", "No limits to the upside.", "David MacGregor", "Did I hear you correctly that it takes about a year to integrate but that for a year you \u2013 they should not be\u2026", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t mean integrate. I don\u2019t mean integrate. I just mean that\u2019s the arithmetic. In other words, if you have a lower margin business and you\u2019re comparing to the year, the year before, you don\u2019t have it in your numbers in the year before. So it stands out like a sore thumb. It\u2019s a variance. And then when you \u2013 so you don\u2019t \u2013 it might be less impact for the next quarter even if it gets better and less impactful, but it\u2019s still going to be dilutive for a couple of quarters. But then, you start to have comparisons where it\u2019s in the base, and you see your improvements standout visibly still that mean.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, absolutely. You got a very good free cash flow storage your acquisitions become a more predominant part of the growth as we go forward from here?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to acquire along our runways for growth, and we have a sort of a list of acquisitions we\u2019re reviewing constantly. I think acquisitions \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re going to become more a greater part of the growth, but we\u2019re constantly reviewing them and you can see us take advantage when the opportunities are there.", "David MacGregor", "Last question is just, how do you promote growth of a second associate on the truck, when all those trucks where you do have a second associates, it seems like your getting superior growth to those that don\u2019t have it. How do you incent your franchisees?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think it\u2019s stuff like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we do two things, one is we try to make sure that there\u2019s a sharing of best practices is that at colloquial meaning like the kickoffs, like the NFAC people are representatives, and they\u2019ll go back and share it with their regions. And then of course, at the SFC, the Snap-on franchisee conference were pretty much all of them come, we try to make sure we trumpet the effects of those things and talk about and provide seminars on how to select and manage those people.", "And also, on our own, we try to provide packages that will support them. They\u2019re not our employees, and we don\u2019t urge these \u2013 it\u2019s a situation. It\u2019s important to say, \u201cThis is not our program.\" But we provide the support programs that make it possible.", "David MacGregor", "Got it. Thanks, Nick", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich.", "Liam Burke", "Yes good morning Nick. Good morning Aldo.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, Liam.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Good morning.", "Liam Burke", "Nick you\u2019ve put a lot of upfront investments in emerging markets in the C&I business. You highlighted the fact that in the \u2013 India and China are doing well. Are you starting to see any kind of positive operating return of those upfront investments?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, they\u2019re profitable, but we keep investing. So I mean, the thing is, the balance is still about where it\u2019s always been, so we don\u2019t necessarily see \u2013 I don\u2019t see a time where we\u2019re going to see huge upside coming there. Because we still see opportunities. So in terms of top end, so we keep trying to reposition ourselves in terms of blue point stores, for example. We had another one this quarter as part of the C&I expense category.", "And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a boost out of them in terms of the financials yet. This is just our view that they\u2019re going to give us returns, and our approach is still, Liam, that we want to build the physicals, because we have confidence that as that wave comes and it starts to come, it starts to come, we\u2019re going to see returns. But we don\u2019t view it as a huge profit opportunity in the near-term, more or less as a positioning opportunity.", "Liam Burke", "Great, thanks, Nick. And Aldo, on the cash flows, just touching the return in there. Even when I\u2019m adjusting for some of the onetimes, your cash flow is starting to grow, it\u2019s starting to accelerate. Beyond the acquisitions, where is the priority for cash allocation going to be?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, the first priority still always remains serving our organic growth. So we\u2019re not afraid to make investments. We talked a little bit about that in the C&I segment. But when there\u2019s opportunities to invest internally, we\u2019re willing to do that as well. And of course, Snap-on credit still is growing. That\u2019s been the use of our cash to some extent, and then as Nick mentioned already, support of acquisitions.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates.", "Scott Stember", "Good morning, guys.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Scott Stember", "Can you maybe talk about some of the new programs or the new tools and products you talked about in the Tools Group? Really, just talking about the new tools, the new cabinet program, new colors. Is there anything else to this new program outside of color? And maybe just talk about the timing of when these new products will touch showing up in your numbers.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, we\u2019re talking about sort of the beginning and sort of like as we go forward into the second quarter and you\u2019re talking about trim as well as programs that wrap around it, so you have kind of programs that try to make sure that people focus on it as well. And so those things are what wraps around the kind of thing. It has to do with, one an attraction that gives someone a reason to buy. This is what we say in the Tools Group. There are \u2013 they\u2019re ongoing types of programs, a lot of programs that roll through this, but we\u2019re talking about it\u2019s aimed at the Tools Group, aimed at a new product that\u2019s going to get peoples\u2019 attention. And we wrap merchandising program around this and promotion program around this and maybe throw in some sort of hat or something like that, that gets people.", "So you give people a reason to pay attention to it. And we think when they pay attention to it, they see those colors with that trim, with the features that are available, this becomes a seller. And the Algona plant has, I think, an incredible amount of different options that can added on to this kind of thing. So we feel pretty good about it. It\u2019s a new \u2013 like I said, it\u2019s a new set of \u2013 it\u2019s a new appearance that people won\u2019t have seen before, and we think that drives excitement. One of the things that does, if you\u2019re in a garage and a guy\u2019s got a box, you like the appearance of a different box. You like some of the features of a different box. He wants trade out because he wants to get attention in his ward. This is what generates the activity.", "Scott Stember", "Got it. And then the RS&I side, you\u2019re starting to see some continued growth here in the \u2013 with the new car, the OEM dealers. Can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there? Are they sustainable trends. And the high single-digit growth that we\u2019re seeing in this segment, if this is something that can persists throughout the year?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know. Look, I think these are program-related. So that particular segments of the business with OEM dealerships tends to be more lumpy than others, because you get a program. And sometimes, that program lasts for 3 quarters and it runs out and you don\u2019t hook onto another program till you get out to the fifth quarter. So there\u2019s a gap quarter in there. That\u2019s \u2013 if you listen to these calls enough, you hear me talk about that stuff.", "But what I am encouraged about this time is, we have vehicle OEMs. We have heavy-duty OEM\u2019s. We have heavy-duty OEMs. We have agriculture OEMs doing this. So it\u2019s a kind of broad view of repair. We haven\u2019t seen that so much come together. So it\u2019s kind of positive in that regard. Now I can\u2019t testify that these are going to continue, because as I said, this tends to be a lumpy portion of our business. But the fact that it\u2019s spread across 3 different places, pretty good.", "Scott Stember", "All right, and last question on currency. Brexit happened, I believe, in the end of the second quarter last year. Is this still a good assumption that in the back half of the year, we should expect the currency comparison to ease?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, although the second quarter, we think \u2013 look, we state today, if the currency stays the way it is today, the second quarter will be somewhat tougher from a currency point of view because the other currencies were stronger in the second quarter then they deteriorated. But you\u2019re right in terms of \u2013 it gets \u2013 the comparisons get easier as it flows out. So what we would \u2013 again, it will probably \u2013 the chance it stands right where it is today is probably low, but if did, we see some rise in currency difficulty going forward to the second quarter and then abatement in the third and fourth quarter.", "Scott Stember", "Got it, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research.", "Tom Hayes", "Hi thanks, good morning gentlemen.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Tom Hayes", "Just wondering if we could dig into the C&I segment just a little bit. Last year, we were talking about three of the end markets: energy, military and avionics. Certainly a bit of challenge in 2016. Just want to see kind of what your thoughts are coming out of Q1 and for the balance of the year for those three segments?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Actually, I\u2019m pretty encouraged. C&I is a big place for us. We got SNA Europe, which I just \u2013 if you\u2019re going to talk about C&I, SNA Europe is a bellwether. That thing has become a monster. It\u2019s growing 14 quarters in sales and 16 quarters in profits. And Europe, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed lately, isn\u2019t the most certain of places, so it\u2019s done pretty well. But if you want to go to critical industries, like I think you\u2019re referring to, which is about 1/3 of the business in C&I, we did focus on military and national resources and aviation. And natural resources came back for us.", "And what I like about this quarter is, it is about the same growth in the critical industries as past quarters. Although sequentially, it looks pretty positive, but also, it\u2019s a little bit more broadly based.", "Last quarter, we had growth, but there are more eggs in the military basket, the military got better by wider \u2013 by a pretty wide margin last quarter, and that delivered the critical industry\u2019s basket for us. This time, we have gains in natural resources in places like wind and mining and places like that oil and gas, and gains in heavy-duty and gains in general industry, a little more broadly based. Military is more tepid. In fact, it\u2019s down a little bit this quarter, difficult to predict where military has gone quarter-to-quarter.", "I said that for a dog\u2019s age on these calls. And then aviation still isn\u2019t solved because for us, the Middle East, the international aviation business is kind of on its back because a lot of that business came out of the Middle East and it isn\u2019t working for us right now. So you\u2019re going to see some kind of recovery outside. You got military, which is chronically variable, and the rest of them are kind of recovering. Aviation, we still haven\u2019t quite solved yet. So think positive, positive. I\u2019m really encouraged.", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. And then Aldo, you start on the financial services piece. I think you kind of covered a little bit. I just want to make sure I understood the components. You said that EBIT margin go down year-over-year from about 70.9 to 68.4. I think you called out it was manpower and additional write-offs. Was that kind of the driver of the change there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "You\u2019re talking about financial services?", "Tom Hayes", "Yes.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes. No, financial services are certainly these higher provisions for receivables over the last couple of quarters. We had that phenomenon in Q4. All I\u2019m saying is that if you look year-over-year your provisioning is higher, I will be at a little bit less than what we had done in Q4 and you\u2019re seeing a little bit of progress on the 60 plus day delinquency indicator.", "Tom Hayes", "Did you also mentioned, I thought you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You \u2013 Do you add manpower to the financial services business?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes. Little bit of additional\u2026", "Tom Hayes", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird.", "Joe Vruwink", "This is Joe Vruwink for David.", "Nick. Pinchuk", "Yes, Joe", "Joe Vruwink", "Can you maybe comment on growth trends in the tools channel as the quarter progressed? And I\u2019d be interested in whether these tax refund delays maybe impacted February at all, and do you start to see activity come back in March as refunds came back?", "Nick. Pinchuk", "No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t see the tax refund delays. We didn\u2019t hear anything like that. Generally, the week-by-week or month-by-month trends in our quarters don\u2019t really mean much. We have quite a bit of variation. It\u2019s sort of like quarter-to-quarter \u2013 quarterly variation in the month.", "So it really doesn\u2019t mean so much. What I will tell you though is that I met just \u2013 we had \u2013 we box part this quarter. In the beginning, like middle of January, we met with the franchisees as they were booming. And then at the end of the quarter, a couple of weeks ago, I met with the franchise \u2013 the National Franchise Council for the U.S. they were really enthusiastic.", "So at least from the windshield surveys, I felt pretty good about it. The numbers are what they are. I still think the growth was \u2013 it was fairly positive for a retail business. But again, we had \u2013 and we had \u2013 so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the market. The market is very positive for us, we think.", "Joe Vruwink", "So when I look at your loan origination growth and let\u2019s say that\u2019s flat, therefore big ticket sales are flattish to do 3% organic growth, and tools implies the core hand tool category, which is obviously the majority of what you\u2019re selling is maybe mid-single-digit growth directionally.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Look, first of all, let\u2019s talk about \u2013 let\u2019s talk a little bit about big ticket. Big ticket, you got diagnostics up. What drives the originations is big ticket. But there\u2019s a new kind of wrinkle in this, and that is the thermal imager in diagnostics. This is a smaller-end diagnostic in effect like in the $1000 range. And what has been in diagnostics almost uniformly being financed is being \u2013 by the credit companies is being \u2013 some of that is being financed by their franchisees, because now they are strong enough to finance something like that.", "So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in the originations activity. And there are other categories besides hand tools. There\u2019s power tool, there are some other stuff, which we call shop and tech and so on. So I don\u2019t think you can make just that view of the world. You can \u2013 you could kind of step back and make it. But you can\u2019t just look at originations in this case and say that big ticket is completely flat, because you have that thermal imager in there this time, which makes it different.", "Joe Vruwink", "So I guess \u2013 yes, so this is what I\u2019m trying to get at. The industry, it seems to be growing at a mid-single digit pace. When you listen to your peers talk about their growth, seems to be mid- single. And when I look at Snap-on and consider that a lot of the products that have seen strong growth this cycle that are tied to originations, those have flattened out. If I look at the other stuff in the Snap-on portfolio, it would seem to be growing mid-single, so at the end of the day Snap-On still growing in line with its market. It\u2019s just we\u2019re weathering these comparisons right now where you have a particular big ticket category you called out tool storage, that is just going through a bit of a soft patch.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, there\u2019s some of that. That\u2019s directionally probably correct. I think our big message here today is, we think the market is pretty good.", "Joe Vruwink", "Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan", "Good morning, guys.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan", "On the corporate expense, the 21 and change, that\u2019s pretty well-controlled. I think a year or two ago, you talked about it sort of being $100 million annual run rate. Should we think about that being more along the lines of 20? Or was that $5 million lower pension contribution the driver to the low level.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Okay. Look, I think \u2013 the way I would say it is, I think we spent something \u2013 let me think. I think we spent about $94 million last year in the corporate expense. I think you could say it\u2019s going to be in that ballpark, maybe uplifting it slightly. That\u2019s the kind of number I would expect. These things ebb and flow back and forth from quarter-to-quarter, so I would model it in that range, if I were you.", "Bret Jordan", "So the $5 million lower pension contribution was sort of just a timing issue around the first quarter.", "Aldo Pagliari", "No. Just to clarify. It\u2019s Aldo. The pension contribution doesn\u2019t really impact expense directly in the short run. Pension is relatively flat year-over-year. That\u2019s just the contribution goes to the pension plan. So that\u2019s not a direct cause and effect. So if you look at corporate expenses, they\u2019re kind of flattish really the last year in Q1. Pension is up so slightly over year-over-year. So I\u2019d say, you\u2019re trending directionally to be, as Nick said, $95 million to $100 million range is still for modeling purposes, not unreasonable.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay. And then a question, I guess \u2013 I\u2019m sure the franchisees are communicating with their customers daily. Is tool storage, is that \u2013 I mean, obviously, it\u2019s more of a discretionary transaction versus diagnostics where you need the current technology to complete the job. Is there an issue there that this is sort of an indicator of mechanic sentiment? Or is it just that there\u2019s nothing new enough and the channels just spur them to buy again.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Look, I think it\u2019s always the case. You can bring out a new power tool or a new diagnostic threat and it can be, let\u2019s say, double as my \u2013 by baseball analogy instead of a home run. I\u2019m not saying that our offering is tremendously better. It\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s strong, but it may not be as compelling as it was the last iteration. It may not be the home run. That\u2019s a difference. I do think you\u2019re right in that tool storage is a little more emotional. You look at that box, you say, \"I remember being on an event once. A guy came at a fair, where this guy said, hey, did you see that white box with a sapphire trim? I really love it. I think I\u2019ve got to buy it.\" He was so excited by just the appearance of the box. So that is the fact in this kind of thing. It\u2019s not a saturation thing.", "Bret Jordan", "What\u2019s the color that\u2019s coming out?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to reveal that, actually, but Bret\u2026", "Bret Jordan", "I mean, I\u2019m going to wait to buy my Snap-on box if I see the new color of that.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, you\u2019re right, right.", "Bret Jordan", "On average yield and it\u2019s up 10 basis points, I mean, I think it was a year ago this quarter we talked about some of the platinum franchisees allowed to be more flexible I think in their decision, their credit decisions. Is yield up because we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve change the borrowing base a little bit? Or is that yield just up because we have seen some interest rate increase year-over-year?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Look, I think it\u2019s more reflective of the actual credit profile, what we\u2019re doing the underwriting on. And as I said, it\u2019s actually down 20 basis points from last quarter. So 18%, 17.9% is kind of the natural range that settles in that, so there really hasn\u2019t been a lot of movements on yields of over the recent turn.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay. All right, great. Thank you.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Robert \u2013 or excuse me, Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.", "Richard Hilgert", "Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody. Just curious with the administration talking about tax reduction. I\u2019ve noticed your tax \u2013 effective tax rate consistently runs about 5 percentage points below the corporate average. If we were to see a reduction from the corporate rate of 35%, down to a 25% number, would your effective tax rate move the same amount or \u2013 are there anything \u2013 any things in your taxes that would change that ratio? Would it be less of a change? More of a change?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Well, first off, Richard, when you look at the overall rate of 31%, you have to remember, we\u2019re about 80% influenced by the United States, 20% influenced by \u2013 let\u2019s say the outside world\u2019s tax rates. So you\u2019re right. If you go back to the 35% statutory federal rate Snap-on takes advantage of probably around 250, a little bit more, slightly more than that of deductions, such as the manufacturing deduction, the R&D tax credit, things of that nature.", "So if you took a step back and look strictly at U.S. taxes as written today, you\u2019d say, \"Well, we\u2019re in the 33% range, maybe the 32.5% range.\" So in theory, if a statutory rate is reduced from 35% to something less than 30%, Snap-on should actually stand to benefit on the U.S. effective tax rate. As you know though, these are pretty complicated items being discussed, so you see the actual rollout of the tax law, it\u2019s really hard to opine on what the impact will be.", "Richard Hilgert", "Understood. Just for clarification, on the C&I group, Nick, you\u2019re saying military was a slight headwind, aviation was a headwind, but natural resources were positive. The European region was positive, doing very well. Is that the correct summary?", "Nick Pinchuk", "That\u2019s correct.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, great. And then I was curious, with the way that the growth rates have been going in RS&I, and you were mentioning some of the dynamics of the big ticket items. Could you maybe describe the growth rates there, more in terms of what\u2019s been your experience with respect to the overall pricing in that group versus the overall volume in that group? And how much does each one affect the growth rate.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Wow. I don\u2019t know. I mean, the thing is, look, all I can say is, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have pricing generally as one of our line items in explanation. We don\u2019t see much motion in pricing. And so generally, when we \u2013 and at both ways, when we price, we tend to do it around the new model which we set the value proposition and therefore, the prices get reset. We don\u2019t like to reduce our prices to get volume, and so we resist that. And we do so in equipment. And so from time to time, it can happen. But in general, you are not seeing us knock down the prices. And if you doubt that, remember what I said, 24.7% OI margin against 140 basis points negative year-over-year impact from acquisitions, that means something \u2013 happen that was worth of 140 basis points.", "Richard Hilgert", "Right. And you mentioned one item that you thought would be on the hit parade this year in the hand tools group. Given the kind of tapering off there, the last couple of quarters, your \u2013 what you said about your hit parade in years past is that you\u2019ve got $1 million per year coming in from the hit parade from the new items that are going out, has that kind of tapered off in the last couple of quarters and then we can expect to see more of that kind of come back a little bit above that? Or how has that all playing out right now?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t know. What we actually measure, Richard, is the number of million-dollar products, not the amount. So you can have Transformers, and you can have some other small \u2013 you can have the Jack Reacher, both of which make some money but aren\u2019t necessarily a lot \u2013 are quite different in terms of the amount of money they\u2019ll have. Transformers is a huge blockbuster, Jack Reacher made some money so that kind of thing, and so that what\u2019s happening in these things. Maybe a fewer the hit products didn\u2019t make us much, maybe a few of tool storage that\u2019s came out didn\u2019t sell quite a much, and they still were hit products.", "What I\u2019m talking about in this particular one is, is that, that\u2019s going to be hit product. We say it\u2019s going to sell a lot more than that particular one. It will sell a lot more than $1 million. Our numbers of hit products though have continue to be pretty good, so they\u2019re not really abating. It\u2019s just the amount that are being associated with it. And hit products aren\u2019t the whole thing, it is that the hit products that drive everything. Hit products drive the excitement through the whole bunch of non-hit products that are driving excitement some of which are former hit products that are older.", "So it\u2019s a more complex \u2013 the revenue add up is a more complex thing. I don\u2019t think you can look at a trend in the big new success \u2013 difference really.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Leslie. Please go ahead.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks, Lauren. We appreciate everyone for joining today.

(NYSE:SNA) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2017 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Nick Pinchuk - CEO", "Aldo Pagliari - CFO", "Leslie Kratcoski - IR", "Analysts", "Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research", "David Leiker - Baird", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Liam Burke - FBR Capital", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer", "Richard Hilgert - Morningstar", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2017 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.", "Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "As usual, we\u2019ve provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our Web site, snapon.com, under Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our Web site, along with a transcript and a replay of today\u2019s call.", "Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.", "Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck which can be found on our Web site.", "With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start with the highlights of our third quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see and then I\u2019ll take you through some of the headwinds we\u2019ve encountered and speak about our progress. Aldo will then provide you a more detailed review of the financials.", "In the third quarter, we again made overall advancements along our runways for both growth and improvement. Total reported sales were up 8.4% to $903.8 million including 5.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation and a boost from acquisitions, including last year\u2019s Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year\u2019s BTC and Norbar business. They combined for an incremental $44.3 million in sales.", "Overall, organic sales were up 2.3% with varying results across the groups. It\u2019s worth noting I think in this period that the major hurricanes which struck Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico did impact our results. We estimate that the sales in the quarter were reduced by about $8 million, principally in the Tools Group but with some smaller impacts in the other businesses.", "Now the operations in the affected areas have generally returned to normal, except for Puerto Rico. But as in the case of Superstorm Sandy in 2012, timing of both further disruption and rebuilding aren\u2019t clear. So they could extend into upcoming quarters.", "Beside the hurricane, we also had a one-time legal charge in the period $15 million to OI or $0.16 to EPS reflecting a California state court judgment in an employment-related litigation brought by an individual that\u2019s being appealed.", "Excluding the legal charge, OpCo operating margin was 18.6% of sales, down 30 basis points, a 90 basis point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency offset in part by operating improvements.", "For financial services, operating income of 56 million compared to last year\u2019s 50.6 million. Excluding the legal charge, earnings per share as adjusted reached $2.45. That\u2019s an increase of 10.4%.", "Now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. We saw mixed results from our businesses in that arena, but based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from our franchisees, from technicians, from shop owners and managers, we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate. And over time, Snap-on\u2019s positions are taking full advantage.", "For the critical industries, verticals like aviation, oil and gas, mining and heavy duty, we\u2019re seeing recovery. Our activity was strong almost across the board. We like the way the critical industries are sounding and trending.", "We have further confirmation of that positive outlook from our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, solid results with substantial growth across the European continent, broad strength; another sign of a favorable environment.", "We do have challenges but there will also be headwinds. They\u2019ve been a factor in other quarters and this past one was the same. But our markets do offer attractive runways for growth and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to confront and offset the challenges and continue enhancing our van channel, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets.", "At the same time, those growth runways are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI as we call it. They\u2019re a constant driver of our [indiscernible] especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology.", "And in this quarter, Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation led to more prestigious product awards than we\u2019ve had; more recognition than in any single year. Snap-on was prominently represented with nine Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN, People's Choice Product Awards where the actual users, the technicians made the sections. That\u2019s great endorsement.", "We\u2019re also recognized with three PTEN Innovation Awards and with three MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Awards and all three of our groups; Tools, RS&I and C&I were part of those achievements. An essential driver on Snap-on growth is innovative products that makes work easier, it\u2019s always been our strength and those third quarter awards are testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming.", "That\u2019s the market overview. Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with Tools. Organic sales down 1.6%. Growth internationally more than offset by declines in the U.S. Operating income in the quarter of 56.3 million, including 2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency compares to 64.6 million in 2016. OI margin of 14.3% versus last year\u2019s 16.3% with that decrease reflecting lower volume and unfavorable mix and a 70 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign currency.", "The third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC as we call it. This year it was in Dallas with more than 8,200 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes. It\u2019s an opportunity for franchisees for training and for ordering new product, and it\u2019s a chance for the company to gauge our franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business.", "Now the order story this year was mixed. Tool storage was up, other products were down and orders were down overall from last year\u2019s record level. But I can attest that the franchisees displayed confidence in our business and optimism in the future. And that positive outlook is reinforced by the advancements evident in our franchisees health metrics, the financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly. They remain favorable and robust.", "We do believe our franchisees continue to grow stronger. And at our most recent National Franchise Advisory Council meeting held just a few weeks ago, I heard the same positive outlook and optimism that was the prevailing mood at the Dallas SFC and there are real reasons for the confidence. The market remains robust and our product line is getting stronger.", "You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that there\u2019s a continuous stream of winning offerings going forward, attention getters. Like our new tool storage power draw in our Masters and Classic tool storage series.", "The power draw gives technicians the ability to organize their cordless tool battery chargers multiplying these days in the shop all in one 16-inch wide draw with 510 volt outlets for battery charging and two USB power ports for quick charging cell phones and other electronic devices.", "It\u2019s configured in a taper device to allow easy access for all seven ports. Power and convenience packaged in the traditional Snap-on tool storage and early reports indicated to win, helping to restart the tool storage line.", "Also new is our 12-volt inverter-driven engine starter plus. Engineered in our Kenosha, Wisconsin labs and manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plants. Arc-less [ph] connection technology that prevents reverse polarity activation that is bad things when you hook a negative up to the positive.", "And a dual circuit feature accommodating both high current jump starting and standard charge in a small device, the benefits of inverter drive. Launched in September, it\u2019s been received with a kind of enthusiasm that will make another of our hit products.", "Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group. Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. Sales increased 47.4 million including 21.6 million of acquisition-related sales and 2.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was 23.7 million or 8.2%, the fourth straight quarter that RS&I has grown organically by high single digits.", "Operating earnings of 83.4 million increased 11.6 million. The operating margin was close to flat with last year, 25% compared to 25.1%. The acquisitions had an unfavorable impact of 140 basis points. But that headwind was pretty much offset by the benefits of RCI and volume.", "The robust RS&I growth represents progress across all our businesses in that group with double digit increases in diagnostics and repair information products sold to independent repair shop owners and managers. High single digit increases to OEM dealerships and a low single digit rise on our undercar equipment.", "And again, in RS&I, customer connection and innovations stood tall offering compelling new offerings, taking advantage of a favorable vehicle repair environment. Innovative new products like our latest handheld, ZEUS, which joins our award-winning diagnostics lineup as the new flagship platform.", "ZEUS was launched following the SFC in late August and surpasses our highly acclaimed VERUS Edge, building on the capabilities of that popular product but further incorporating our intelligent diagnostic software providing the technician with pinpoint guidance for repair.", "Intelligent diagnostic is made possible by Snap-on\u2019s proprietary big data that guides the technician in solving those very unusual problems, hard to analyze; those very unusual hard to analyze vehicle repair problems and as a consequence saving a lot of time. It\u2019s no wonder the ZEUS has been well received. And in just a short time it helped drive the strong RS&I progress in the quarter.", "Diagnostics are becoming increasingly essential to vehicle repair. Snap-on is the gold standard and you can see it in the numbers. So to wrap up RS&I, substantial achievements across the division, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers, continuing a very favorable trend and reinforcing our belief in the strength of the vehicle repair market.", "Now on to C&I. The sales of 314.6 million in the quarter increased 8.7% including 22.7 million of sales related to acquisitions and 2 million of favorable foreign currency. Organic growth was 0.2%. But that was the result of significant gains in critical industries, higher activity at SNA Europe and a decline in the sales of power tool products at the Tools Group.", "Operating margin reached 15.9%, up 80 basis points from last year\u2019s 15.1%, improvement reflecting an ongoing stream of innovative new products for critical industries and a robust effort in RCI. They combined in the quarter to more than offset a 40 basis point impact of our recent acquisitions and a 10 basis point decrease from unfavorable foreign currency.", "Just a word here on our acquisitions; great additions to our product lines. At this point though, they\u2019re dilutive to our profit ratios. But going forward we see them as landscape for improvement as we apply Snap-on value creation to their operations, they\u2019re a great future opportunity.", "Now back to C&I progress. The industrial division showed broad based gains across most of the critical industries with \u2013 as I said, most of the critical industries with strong year-over-year performance now accomplished for three straight quarters. Critical industries are coming back. And when we couple that favorable environment with innovative new product aimed at solving critical tasks, we get very encouraging results.", "Advancements driven by innovation by products like our automated tool control unit or ATC, our smart tool box. In critical industries tool use needs to be controlled, safe and productive. Snap-on ATC is the top of the line solution, fully automated organization tool visibility, access control and asset management. And our recent enhancements have made it even better.", "New options like ZoomID and FastFlag; ZoomID providing individual tool recognition with special tool pegging essentially for serialized, certified or calibrated tools of these individual documentation, like torque wrenches or gauges, all important items for accomplishing critical tasks.", "And our FastFlag featured display giving the user quick visual feedback on the status of the box, whether it\u2019s locked with all the tools accounted and are unlocked with the tools issued in a use or prompts exist such as wrong tools returned. It\u2019s products like these aimed at industry needs that are helping to drive our progress across the critical industries and we believe the advancements only continue.", "Now let\u2019s speak about SNA Europe. 16 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth in sales navigating through some difficult geographies and economies. SNA Europe\u2019s volume continues to be positive but its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 18 straight quarters and we believe there\u2019s still an abundant opportunity.", "One of the ways SNA Europe has been capturing customers is our new Bahco Ergo Tool Management System, the BETMS. It provides the ability to customize the product to specific needs. Actually BETMS demonstrates a key change behind SNA Europe\u2019s positive trend, reaching directly to end users, increasing customer connection, configuring just the right tool kits from the broad SNA Europe lineup and matching customers\u2019 specifications particularly. This new customer direct approach is transforming SNA Europe and helping to drive its ongoing trend of encouraging results.", "C&I third quarter; maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries and building both sale and profitability. Well, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Tools Group, working to reenact the van channel; RS&I, clearly continuing its strong and expanding profitability with repair shop owners and managers; and C&I now establishing its own positive trend and growth in profitability extending across critical industries.", "Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically by 2.3% despite the multiple hurricanes. And excluding the legal charge, as adjusted EPS of $2.45, up 10.4% in a turbulent environment.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $903.8 million in the third quarter increased 8.4%, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain, $44.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation.", "The organic sales gain reflects ongoing progress in serving repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle repair sector as well as solid growth in sales to customers in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business.", "Consolidated gross margin of 49.6% declined 60 basis points, primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and lower gross margins on acquisition-related sales, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.", "Operating expenses of $295.5 million included the $50 million charge related to the judgment that, as Nick has mentioned, is being appealed. The operating expense margin of 32.7% was 140 basis points higher as 170 basis points for the legal charge and 30 basis points of operating expenses for acquisitions were partially offset by sales volume leverage.", "Operating earnings before financial services of $153.1 million or 16.9% of sales included $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and the $15 million legal charge and compares to $157.6 million or 18.9% of sales last year. Excluding the legal charge, operating earnings before financial services as adjusted was $168.1 million or 18.6% of sales.", "Financial services revenue of $79 million and operating earnings of $56 million increased $7.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, as compared to last year.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $209.1 million or 21.3% of revenues compared to $208.2 million or 23% of revenues last year. Excluding the legal charge, consolidated operating earnings as adjusted was $224.1 million or 22.8% of revenues.", "Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 30.1% was reduced by 60 basis points as a result of the legal charge. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 31.2%.", "Finally, net earnings of $133.4 million or $2.29 per diluted share compared to $131.7 million or $2.22 per share a year ago, representing a 3.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. Excluding the legal charge, on an after tax basis, net earnings as adjusted of $142.7 million or $2.45 per share represented a 10.4% increase in diluted earnings per share as adjusted.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $314.6 million in the quarter increased 8.7%, reflecting a 0.2% organic sales gain, $22.7 million of acquisition-related sales, and $2.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation.", "The organic sales increase includes a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries and a low single-digit increase in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business. These increases were substantially offset by a double-digit increase in the sales of power tools and a mid single-digit sales decline in the segment\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations.", "Gross profit of 40.3% increased 130 basis points from 39% last year, primarily due to favorable business mix and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 24.4% increased 50 basis points from 23.9% in 2016, primarily due to 40 basis points of operating expenses for acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million increased $6.4 million from 2016 levels and the operating margin of 15.9% improved 80 basis points.", "Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $392.7 million decreased 1.1%, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales decline, partially offset by $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid single-digit decrease in the company\u2019s U.S. franchise operations partially offset by a double-digit sales gain in the international operations.", "Gross margin of 41.8% decreased from 43.6% last year, primarily due to a year-over-year shift in product mix and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 27.5% increased 20 basis points from 27.3%, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales.", "Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million including $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 16.3% last year.", "Turning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9, third quarter sales of $333.5 million increased 16.6% reflecting an 8.2% organic sales gain, $21.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation.", "The organic sales increase was once again solid and broad based, reflecting double-digit gains in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a high single-digit sales increase to OEM dealerships as well as a low single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment.", "Gross margin of 47.3% improved 80 basis points as a result of 40 basis points of benefit from acquisitions and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 22.3% increased 90 basis points principally due to 180 basis points of impact from acquisitions, partially offset by benefits of sales volume leverage.", "Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.4 million increased $11.6 million from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.0% compared to 25.1% last year, including a 140 basis point impact from acquisitions.", "Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $56.0 million on revenue of $79 million compared to operating earnings of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million last year.", "Financial services expenses of $23 million increased $2 million, primarily due to an increase in the provisions for credit losses. While total provision expense of $13.6 million in the third quarter is up $2.3 million year-over-year, it is fairly comparable with the $13.4 million incurred in Q2.", "As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both the third quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the third quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.9% in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. The respected average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.4%.", "Total loan originations of $271.8 million in the third quarter increased $2.0 million or 0.7% year-over-year, as higher originations of contract receivables were partially offset by a decline in originations of finance receivables due in part to lower year-over-year tool storage sales by the Snap-on Tools Group.", "Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.97 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.71 billion from our U.S. operation. In the third quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $59.4 million or 3.1%.", "As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these are as expected tracking higher year-over-year. We believe these trends, however, continue to reflect our view of an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business.", "As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.7 million represented 2.77% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 61 basis point year-over-year and 16 basis points sequentially. However, net losses related to finance receivables of $11.1 million in the third quarter were up sequentially by only $0.3 million from $10.8 million in the second quarter. ", "The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for U.S. extended credit increased 30 basis points sequentially as compared to a more typical seasonal increase of about 20 basis points. Overall, operating earnings in financial services segment rose 10.7% year-over-year and 2.6% sequentially.", "Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $95.5 million in the quarter decreased $16.4 million from comparable 2016 levels, primarily due to higher working investment.", "During the quarter, we also elected to make a $30 million discretionary contribution into our domestic pension plans, an increase of $20 million as compared to Q3 2016.", "Net cash used by investing activities of $61.1 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.2 million. Capital expenditures of $22.9 million in the quarter compared with $16.5 million last year.", "Net cash used by financing activities of $29.5 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $40.7 million and the repurchase of 603,000 shares of common stock for $90.1 million under our previously announced share repurchase programs.", "Year-to-date share repurchases totaled 1.35 million shares for $212.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by higher short-term borrowing, principally commercial paper.", "Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $76.4 million from 2016 year-end level, including $22.2 million of foreign currency translation and $9.1 million from acquisitions. Days sales outstanding of 67 days was up from 63 days at year-end including the impact of acquisition and currency which combined increased DSOs by about three days.", "Inventories increased $119.4 million from 2016 year-end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions resulting from, as an example, increased penetration into critical industries and emerging markets.", "In addition, foreign currency translation and acquisitions contributed $24.1 million and $6 million of the increase, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.1 compared to 3.3 at year-end.", "Our quarter-end cash position of $94.1 million increased $16.5 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio increased to 27.6% from 26.3% at 2016 year-end. ", "In addition to our $94.1 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $170 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s the third quarter. Sales growth and expanded profit in turbulence. We feel quite positive regarding our position. Our markets; vehicle repair remains attractive and the critical industries are recovering. Our businesses; RS&I is expanding with repair shop owners and managers strengthening its already extraordinary hardware and software product lines with the ZEUS breaking new ground in vehicle diagnostics.", "RS&I are registering its fourth straight quarter of high single-digit growth and a profitability that keeps improving offsetting the dilution of acquisitions. C&I extending the critical industries, the industrial division achieving broad growth, the third straight quarter of positive performance driven by new product that match the needs of professional. And SNA Europe, ongoing growth trend, sales up for 16 straight quarters and profits rising 18 straight. It\u2019s a difficult environment with more to go.", "And C&I profitability, 15.9%, up 80 basis points against a 50 basis impact of acquisitions and currency. And the Tools Group undergoing some tuning but still a strong business in a strong market. The Tools Group is a combination of market, brand, business model and team that we believe are natural advantages and that we believe will author positive trends going forward.", "And our acquisitions; dilutive now, but as we apply Snap-on value creation we see abundant possibilities for gain. And all of that added up in the quarter to growth and improvement. Sales up 8.4% as reported, 2.3% organically against 80 basis points of hurricane.", "And excluding the legal charges, adjusted EPS at $2.45, a rise of 10.4%. Going forward, we believe we have wide runways for growth and improvement and we have the business models, the processes and the capabilities to take full advantage and continue our progress on into the fourth quarter and beyond.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak to our franchisees and associates. The advancements we\u2019ve made and the headwinds we\u2019ve overcome are a direct result of your energy, your capability and your dedication. For your success in authoring our progress, you have my congratulations. And for your dedication to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Gary Prestopino [Barrington Research].", "Gary Prestopino", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Prestopino", "A couple of things. Aldo, could you just go through on the RS&I the percentage increases that you cited there in terms of the sale with the various broad-based product categories? I couldn\u2019t write quick enough.", "Aldo Pagliari", "So again I think I framed it this way is that it was solid really pretty across the board. They were up high single digits if you look at the diagnostics and repair information sector. They were up in sales to OEM dealerships mid single digits and also I think they were low single digits in sales of undercar equipment. So a pretty solid performance across the board.", "Gary Prestopino", "Okay. Thank you. Then, Nick, did I hear you said right at the franchisees the conference that you had that tool storage sales were up but other sales were down. Is that correct?", "Nick Pinchuk", "That\u2019s what you heard. Now I want to make sure that everybody who\u2019s listening just understands. The SFC \u2013 when we talk about the SFC we talk about orders, not sales. These are orders that occur off the SFC floor. It\u2019s a big floor that shows products. And so there are orders and those orders can be distributed over several quarters. Some of them are for the third quarter, some are for the fourth and they stretch out into the first quarter, maybe even to the second quarter of next year. So it\u2019s spread out over a period of time. So SFC orders aren\u2019t necessarily a direct indicator of what\u2019s to come in any particular quarter or even in total. But that\u2019s the characteristics of it. Our tool storage product, remember we said we were going to try to adjust the tool storage product line, make it more attractive. I think it looks attractive and the orders on the SFC floor seem to make [indiscernible].", "Gary Prestopino", "Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of the increase and the decrease or not?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we\u2019re talking about mid single digits, that kind of thing. But if you remember last year was record \u2013 I said in my remarks, last year\u2019s SFC was a record performance for orders. Now again I want to emphasize. Nobody should get overheated about orders off the SFC. They\u2019re just indicative of things. They\u2019re not necessarily definitive about things. But it\u2019s better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.", "Gary Prestopino", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from David Leiker [Baird].", "David Leiker", "Good morning, everyone.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning, David.", "David Leiker", "Aldo, just two numbers questions first. On the acquisition, I know you went through by segment. You talked about how much dilutive they were along the way. But can you \u2013 at a corporate level, at the EBIT line, the acquisitions are dilutive by what kind of a number?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure. If you look at the overall corporation, the acquisitions depressed earnings by about 50 basis points if you look at the OpCo operating margins as a percent of sales. And again that\u2019s strictly the ratio that the acquisitions start with an OI percentage that\u2019s lower than the average of the business units that they\u2019ve been subsumed into. And over time we expect to be able to add some value creation tactics into those results and improve them.", "David Leiker", "Is there an intent to ascend those businesses to get them to \u2013 within each of those segments to \u2013 the segment level margins or is there room for something further than that?", "Aldo Pagliari", "I think each acquisition stands on its own and is unique as you know whether they\u2019re acquisitions of recent times. There\u2019s a small one that was software related. And our hardware related business such as undercar equipment is not going to reach the levels of the software business, but we think there\u2019s opportunity to improve.", "David Leiker", "And then you had mentioned a transactional item in Snap-on Tools segment, I\u2019m guessing that exports out of the U.S. with the weaker dollar into Canada, UK?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure. So if you look at it again, we still have the dilemma \u2013 not dilemma, it\u2019s just that we manufacture tools in the United States and sell them internationally. So if you look at the timing of when currency changes in Canada and in United Kingdom, particularly in the United Kingdom, you have timing differences related to inventory but that\u2019s where most of the transaction negative effect occurs.", "David Leiker", "Okay. And then if we take a look at the storm tonight, I know this is \u2013 we\u2019re not dealing with hard data on this, but if you look at what happened in Texas and Florida and you talked about the sales impact to that. Can you flush that out just a little bit in terms of what kind of an impact there might have been at Snap-on credit in terms of originations, delinquencies, losses at all, any color you could share there?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Sure. We took some \u2013 I\u2019d say still rather nominal increases in the provision within the quarter. So the provision is up specific a bit to some of the effects of the hurricanes. Now traditionally when we look back over events in the past, like Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, over time there\u2019s no clear evidence that storms such as these result in permanent disruption to the credit business. Having said that, certainly Puerto Rico is a bit of a different animal, so we\u2019ll look into the future and see how that develops. But to give you some dimensions, David, is that if you look at the portfolio on these areas, if you look at Texas that was affected, in Florida, a little bit of Georgia and into the Caribbean, you\u2019re looking at probably 9.8% of the U.S. EC portfolio just to give you a dimension. And if you look within that, about 2.6% of the whole U.S. portfolio, people have asked for extensions. We have a process where people can ask \u2013 if they\u2019re in good standing, they can ask for an extension and we certainly honor that request if they\u2019re in a distressed situation. So that gives you a little bit of a dimension as to what is out there. As we go forward in Q4, we\u2019ll see what the impact is on collection activity and remittances. But it\u2019s certainly too early to tell. So we took some provisions in Q3. I think Q4 will be a little bit more telling. If you go back to Superstorm Sandy, we didn\u2019t see the full effects of Sandy really until one or two quarters after.", "David Leiker", "And then two or three quarters beyond that, you see a positive impact I would guess?", "Aldo Pagliari", "There\u2019s a potential. Obviously most of us I think would expect there to be rebuilding. Certainly there\u2019s going to be auto repair if your car has been damaged and garages will have to replace equipment that\u2019s been under water or adversely impacted and I think that\u2019s been the tradition. Again, Puerto Rico could be a little bit longer for it to return and how it returns [indiscernible]. Our activity in Puerto Rico is we sell annually in Puerto Rico $5 million maybe.", "David Leiker", "Okay. And then one last item. Nick, if you could talk a little bit about the power tool weakness, that\u2019s something that we hadn\u2019t really been seeing? It\u2019s been more of a growth driver for your business. But if you could give us some color on what\u2019s going on there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Look, I think partly it has to do with tension. One of the things we talked about in the second quarter was that the profitability of the Tools Group is very strong and a lot of that was driven by the introduction of new power tools, particularly our PT850. And that really had a big spike in the second quarter driving both the profitability and some of the sales to that business and I think we had some of the \u2013 one of the big factors here was just sort of a giveback for that strong power tools quarter in the second quarter. That\u2019s the primary situation. And David, every one of our quarters if we gave you \u2013 if you wanted to focus on these things, there will always be ups and downs. And so this is just down for power tools and those power tools come out of Asia and our Murphy, North Carolina and our Kenosha factories. So that\u2019s what [indiscernible] both in C&I.", "David Leiker", "And then just one follow up on that one. If you took kind of Q2, Q3 together with power tools, would that have been consistent with what the pattern had been?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, I think this might be a little weaker but nothing to get in \u2013 but nothing really to get our attention.", "David Leiker", "Great. Thank you very much for the time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor [Longbow Research].", "David MacGregor", "Good morning, everyone. Nick, I wondered if you could just talk about the deterioration in Tools segment operating margins. And I\u2019m guessing some of this may have been attributable to the storms, but it also looks kind of working through the numbers, so maybe you had some weakness in some of the small ticket sales as well. And I wondered if you could just sort of --?", "Nick Pinchuk", "That\u2019s certainly right. What happened was is that the deterioration of the \u2013 if you might remember what drove the good strong margins in the second quarter was I think we cited two particularly products, the power tool, the 850 and particularly some of the new offerings sort of the long-handle flex-head ratchet which sold very well. One of the things that drives profitability in the Tools Group are the products they make themselves. You see they make tool storage and they make hand tools. And when those are weak, it tends to put a pretty strong \u2013 when those are weak in combination, it puts a pretty strong headwind on their profitability and that\u2019s really what you were seeing in this quarter. You saw some weakness in tool storage, although it wasn\u2019t as weak as the second quarter and you saw weakness in some of the hand tool business. Diagnostics was up because of the ZEUS, but diagnostics the margin shared between the Tools Group and RS&I, so it doesn\u2019t accrue. And that\u2019s what you saw. And you saw, of course, its lower volume. You have volume effects and then you do have the hurricane. So those things combined for that kind of weakness.", "David MacGregor", "What should we be thinking about that business for 4Q and into the first half of '18?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think every quarter is a different situation and I\u2019ll only say that I\u2019ve said for dogs age that the third quarter is kind of squarely and hasn\u2019t any indication of things going forward. I think we feel pretty positive about where the business is going. Tool storage in the SFC it seems as though maybe we\u2019ve kind of saw some of the product prompt [ph] and that\u2019s a very good indication. We\u2019re retooling the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs. About 50% of them will be retooled by the end of the fourth quarter. And so we see that kind of coming back in that situation. So we\u2019re pretty positive about it, sort of hit a time for tuning and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, refurbishing the product line. That applies a little bit to hand tools. We\u2019re going to be coming out with some new hand tools that will shake people up a little bit and get that restarted. So it all has to do with product. But I think we\u2019re optimistic going forward.", "David MacGregor", "Can you just say if you expect a drag on the Tools segment growth less pronounced with each quarter from this point forward from storage?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s hard for me to say that, but I would expect \u2013 I was encouraged by the \u2013 even though the orders were down overall in SFC, I was encouraged by the tool storage results which tends to be a kind of bellwether. Hand tools can move up and hand tools and power tools can move up and down depending on how the bundles are made in the SFC and so on and how people get excited about it. And the franchisees tend to have a broad array of hand tools on their vans and so that can move up and down depending on when you install new products. So I\u2019m pretty optimistic. I think the drag goes down. We\u2019re recovering from the product line [indiscernible] in tool storage and we\u2019re retooling the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs and I think we have some exciting new products like I talked about coming out.", "David MacGregor", "Great. Last question just on competition. I guess Matco and Mac both talked about adding trucks to their fleet and you\u2019ve talked about holding your truck count constant, because on the surface it would seem that your share is being at less threatened. Can you talk about what Snap-on is doing maybe to defend and even grow its share while your percentage of the industry fleet is being diluted by competitors\u2019 expansion?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It comes down to trying to expand \u2013 enable the vans with new product. New product is the first and foremost. We think we have the best product. ZEUS is the best. ZEUS is going to change everything. In other words, you heard our idea about SureTrack. For example, SureTrack allowed the guy to look at the car and say 92% of the time this was solved by changing the mass airflow sensor. That helps for the high volume. But every once in a while something comes up, it comes up on alternate Tuesdays and it takes forever to fix. Intelligent diagnostic guides them through this like no one else can and so those kind of things help. Secondly, we\u2019re expanding the space on the vans. One of the reasons you see \u2013 in a lot of cases you can see it reflected in franchise finance is that the van drivers are buying or leasing bigger trucks, 20-foot trucks not the 16-foot trucks giving them more retail space. And we believe these kinds of things, better product, more space and then we\u2019re working on helping them with their time so they have more time to sell, that\u2019s what wins for us.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Liam Burke [FBR Capital].", "Liam Burke", "Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Good morning.", "Liam Burke", "Nick, in the C&I division you\u2019ve made some significant investment upfront in emerging markets. Could you give us a little color on the Asia Pacific and what happened during the quarter?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure. Asia Pacific in the overall results \u2013 the local sales, the sales into the Asia Pacific was up, particularly good quarters in China and India. They\u2019re always mixed. So China and India were good quarters year-over-year. Indonesia was down, for example. But in the region overall, those external sales rose in the quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with that. The sales in supplying the Tools Group principally, basically power tools coming out of the Kunshan factory were down relatively sharply and therefore that tended to overwhelm the growth and it made it down somewhat in the quarter. That\u2019s how that works. So if you\u2019re looking at the local activity, I think a quarter of progress. If you\u2019re looking at it as a supplier to the divisions in the West, principally the Tools Group, it was a down quarter.", "Liam Burke", "Got it, okay. And Nick, you pointed out both inventory and receivables were off based on acquisitions. If you net out acquisitions, would you anticipate those ratios to be normal?", "Aldo Pagliari", "The ratios are fairly similar to the working capital ratios in total for the corporation. What I did say, Liam, is that one day more or less is what impacts DSOs and it relates to the acquisitions. But the inventory turnovers are similar to our core business.", "Liam Burke", "And you wouldn\u2019t anticipate any change with that going forward? I mean within reason. Of course you\u2019ll get quarter-to-quarter variability but --?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Yes, I think as we move forward we look at the opportunities that the inventories present. We expect there to be a return on our inventories. We\u2019re not unwilling to invest in them if we think the returns are there. So I don\u2019t like to get ahead of myself on a conclusion that the inventory is not required, because so far the acquisitions have been performing nicely with respect to our expectations.", "Liam Burke", "Great.", "Nick Pinchuk", "I think we\u2019d say that working capital isn\u2019t necessarily a source of cash going forward. And our overall return on assets when you adjust for the acquisitions, the [indiscernible] is up 80 basis points. So I think we feel okay about that. Now that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t move.", "Liam Burke", "Great. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Aldo.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan [Jefferies].", "Bret Jordan", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan", "To follow up on that Matco and Mac question, are you seeing any increasing price competition out of those guys that they\u2019re building up the franchise base a bit? And I guess how do you see Craftsman entering the market in 2018 obviously with some broader distribution under new ownership? Is that a price competitor or is that just really not in the same product set?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Let me answer them in a reverse order. Craftsman\u2019s been ubiquitous for a long time of course not on a van, but ubiquitous. And people have \u2013 they\u2019ve been in fliers all over the place and every Sunday morning paper, so people are well aware of the price difference. So I don\u2019t see the balance changing with Craftsman. It may work in some instance but those people may not be our customers to begin with. Secondly, for the other guys they\u2019ve been expanding but I\u2019m not hearing competition on price from our franchisees. I don\u2019t hear that. Actually I continue to hear questions turning in on ourselves; gee, this is a great diagnostic unit. It\u2019s better than everybody else. Gee, I\u2019d like to have the power tool with little different features because other people might have those. This was better than \u2013 this wasn\u2019t as good as our old power tool or not enough better than our old power tool. Those are the kinds of things I hear. For tool storage I hear, gee, the tool storage line isn\u2019t catching our imagination. It isn\u2019t getting technicians to come out and say, I got to have that box. By the way I think we had some of that at the SFC. So those are the kinds of things I\u2019m hearing. Now maybe there is that. Of course you would think as Mac and Matco declare better performance they will be gaining \u2013 they will be at least growing their sales and therefore taking business that theoretically could be ours even if it\u2019s maybe not our business to begin with. But I\u2019m not hearing it from the rank and file.", "Bret Jordan", "Okay. And then a question \u2013 I think Aldo maybe you addressed this, but the U.S. tools growth versus U.S. credit originations growth, did you break out what was in credit what was in the U.S.? It would seem like maybe we\u2019re going to be ticking back up since you\u2019re seeing more strength in some of the high value product?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Growth in originations, if you look at our cash flow statement you\u2019ll see that the finance receivables were down a little over 2%, which is pretty consistent with what you see in the performance of our activity in the United States. So they were fairly similar in that regard. This time of the year we pick up some additional originations at the SFC in particular, the Snap-on Franchise Conference, where we have higher contract receivables. Again, it\u2019s a seasonal item but it was up year-over-year which I find is a nice indicator of the franchisee willingness to invest in their business. So in particular we saw them expanding their investment in vans. In particular, some of them getting new vans which are larger than the old ones and people making upgrades. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve gotten an answer to your question, but there were pretty similar I\u2019d say in terms of the performance in quarter.", "Bret Jordan", "And we\u2019d expect maybe a better percentage of high value product sales into the second half of the year, so maybe a tick up on the loan to the mechanic as well?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Well, I\u2019m not going to predict the Q4 mix of sales going forward. Nick said that tool storage orders at the show were positive. If that follows through with sales of tool storage, no doubt Snap-on credit will be a beneficiary.", "Bret Jordan", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we\u2019ll go to Christopher Glynn [Oppenheimer].", "Christopher Glynn", "Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if we could take a look at the Snap-on tools linearity in the quarter. It was kind of interesting. You had the destock in June and then the orders softness at the tradeshow. We heard about maybe less discounting. Did you see a pickup in the normal flow of orders outside the tradeshow as the quarter drew to a close?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Yes, because look I think \u2013 Chris, it\u2019s like at the tradeshow last year, at the \u2013 we don\u2019t call it that. At the Franchise Conference we launched that thermal imager which was incandescent in terms of product. Everybody got excited and we sold a lot of \u2013 remember I said \u2013 I think I might have said that it adds a new version of diagnostics and it sold quite a bit. That was launched at the show. Now we didn\u2019t launch the new ZEUS until after the show, 10 days, two weeks afterwards. So in terms of the product offering, if you just look at diagnostics for one, it wasn\u2019t quite as compelling in the show. We had a number of reasons to do that. But what happened is the ZEUS launched in late August and sold out through September. So you did see a pop from that. And to the extent that diagnostics from the Tools Group was up in the quarter that was on the back of that late selling. And you have all kinds of things around the tool storage. Sometimes the SFC have different offerings that more or less appeal or don\u2019t and people say, okay, I\u2019m going to wait for later to take advantage of some of the products that inevitably comes out on a monthly basis.", "Christopher Glynn", "And are you starting to see any replenishment into the vans on the hand tool side?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I think I see nothing that \u2013 I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t see that but I\u2019m saying to you this is an effect that we\u2019re coming off the third quarter. The third quarter is a tough quarter to find any directional idea, because it can result in \u2013 you can have blips with technicians coming back from vacation. Our franchisees to the extent they\u2019ve been doing well take longer vacation and that can create perturbations in the third quarter. So I don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019re positive going forward though. I think we like our product line. We like where we are. We like the reception of the franchisees. We like what they say about the market. So you would think you would see some recovery in that situation.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay. And then delinquency is up and tools not growing right now. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing more volume on collateral resale.", "Aldo Pagliari", "The residual values have been pretty steady. Again, there\u2019s variation and I don\u2019t know if the hurricane is going to cause \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it did in Q3 but it\u2019s going to be harder to repossess things that have been washed away. That could be. But residual values have been pretty steady, Chris. So we don\u2019t see a lot of variation in that.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay. And lastly you\u2019re not implementing or contemplating any changes to your pricing models?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that going forward. We\u2019re always reviewing situations. For example, steel costs are going upwards. We could look at pricing associated \u2013 we\u2019ve always said we can price for visible steel. We kind of make those kinds of decisions on a regular basis, maybe monthly --", "Christopher Glynn", "I kind of meant outside the normal reactions to commodity costs and things like that?", "Nick Pinchuk", "I don\u2019t think so. You mean just move our prices up or down? No, I don\u2019t think so.", "Christopher Glynn", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our last question from Richard Hilgert [Morningstar].", "Richard Hilgert", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Good morning.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Good morning.", "Richard Hilgert", "Just wanted to follow on to the delinquency question there. We were headed downwards from the December numbers on the delinquency looking to improve a little bit, and then we ticked back up well above the December delinquency rates. And I was just curious, would that cause you to rethink any of your credit policies at this point?", "Aldo Pagliari", "Richard, just a reminder \u2013 this is Aldo. First off, there is always a seasonal effect. The delinquencies tend to creep up in Q3 and Q4 as you approach the holiday season. They intend to improve a bit as people get close to tax refund dates in and around March and April. So there is that underlying seasonal trend. And as what I\u2019m trying to point out, usually you see a creep upwards of about 20 basis points historically in the delinquency metric. This time it\u2019s up 30. So it is up. And we are up year-over-year in terms of to a higher level of delinquency performance. I expect that to kind of continue. It\u2019s been fairly stable looking at factoring off the seasonal trends since Q4. So again, we\u2019re always looking at it. However, this is still pretty good business. If you look at this at a high level, remember it\u2019s there to support sales of the Tools Group principally. 95% of what the credit company does is for the purpose. And Tools Group makes decent margins when they sell tools. And if you look at the yield on these receivables, despite the bad debt in SG&A, it\u2019s a pretty good return to the bottom line. So we look at it but we\u2019re pretty comfortable that it\u2019s performing as expected.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, great. On the acquisition dilution, how soon would you expect that dilution to reverse itself and what are the measures that you needed to take in order to do this? Is this a matter of gaining some type of distribution synergies or cost reductions? What are the actions there?", "Nick Pinchuk", "All of the above. Look, here\u2019s the schedule. I think we acquired Car-O-Liner on October 31 of last year, so we\u2019d lap that. So it would go into the base as of October 31. Sturtevant Richmont goes in, in November. So two of the four acquisitions we talk about here will have a partial effect on the fourth quarter and then disappear in January. And then BTC and Norbar were sometime last year. I think Norbar was acquired in May or something like that. So you have that kind of schedule where they cycle off. If you\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re going to improve them with Snap-on value creation, two things. One is of course we acquire for product primarily to give us a position with customers we weren\u2019t accessing or to give us more to sell to either repair shop owners or managers or people in critical industries and they do that, so will gain from selling their products; Norbar to critical industries, Car-O-Liner to repair shop owners or managers and so on. But there\u2019s another factor. Snap-on value creation authors improvement, margin improvement, doing things better everyday like we have in the operations throughout Snap-on. So you\u2019ll see both of those working in tandem in the acquisition. It usually takes a while to get an acquisition on board integrated and then you start finding traction for those processes.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, very good. The last question, the SFC you mentioned that the orders for new tool storage equipment, those orders would get filled over time. Have you already ramped up production of the new tool storage equipment or is this a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s going to take time to ramp that up and then get the product out?", "Nick Pinchuk", "It\u2019s not a production problem. But like I said, it\u2019s a long way thing. SFC echoes through several quarters through \u2013 it\u2019s in the third, fourth and end of the first quarter. So we have time to recover depending on what those orders are. And then remember, every month people order and it overlays on top of that, but we don\u2019t see a production problem.", "Richard Hilgert", "So when you go into SFC, you\u2019ve already got the new product that you\u2019re showing at the conference in production and it\u2019s ready for the franchisees to order immediately?", "Nick Pinchuk", "Almost always, but in fact not that much gets ordered immediately. They don\u2019t walk away with tool storage, but they can. So we\u2019re ready for that. We have models that kind of say, this is likely the distribution of these products depending on the particular product, depending on the size of it, depending on the cost. And so we model it in a fairly complex way. So we\u2019re ready to go.", "Richard Hilgert", "Okay, great. Thanks again.", "Nick Pinchuk", "Sure.", "Aldo Pagliari", "Have a good day.", "Operator", "That\u2019s all we have for the time we have for questions. So at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks.", "Leslie Kratcoski", "Thanks, Alan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Have a good day.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.", "We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results.

Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website.", "With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the market environment and on progress we've made. After that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.", "This is not a typical quarter. There are a number of special non-recurring events that impacted result, the legal charge, and the transition associated with the new tax law. But when you look through all that, Snap-on again showed overall and significant progress along our runways, achieving both growth and profitability.", "As with most quarters, we had headwinds and we had opportunities. We took advantage of the opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Overall sales in the quarter were $974.6 million, 9.5% higher than last year, strong. That total included $29.7 million of acquisition-related volume from last year's Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year's BTC and Norbar businesses, and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency. Our organic growth was 4.3% relatively encouraging with varied results across the groups.", "Let's start by looking at the non-recurring events. First, the one-time legal charge. A judgment in a pat-related litigation matter that is being appealed. It impacted operating income by $30.9 million and the earnings per share by $0.33. Second, a $7 million or $0.12 EPS charge associated with the implementation in the new U.S. tax legislation.", "Excluding the legal charge, OpCo operating margin was 19.4% of sales, down 40 basis points, reflecting primarily a 30 basis point dilution from lower margin acquisitions and the impact of favorable foreign currency.", "For Financial Services, operating income of $54.4 million compared to last year's $51.6 million. As-reported, the EPS was $2.29, but excluding the legal charge and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted grew to $2.69, that's an increase of 8.9%. That's our result.", "And our market, what we believe the automotive repair segments continue to remain favorable, although, we again saw mixed results in that arena, new technologies, aging vehicles, requiring innovative tools and specialized equipment and updated diagnostics and more repairs continue to make that a favorable place to be. As I said though, we had mixed outcomes.", "Our Tools Group was below trend and in the U.S., looking similar to what we saw in the third quarter, unsatisfying. However, the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group continued its considerable advancement serving repair shop owners and managers.", "From an overview level, we believe the ongoing progress of RS&I, taken together with what we know would be the strong fundamentals clearly indicate that there's ongoing and abundant opportunity available in the segment.", "Now if you look to Commercial & Industrial \u2013 now our Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, it had one of its strongest quarters. Organic sales were up nicely across almost all industries and geographies, including Europe and Asia. Performances in the period from our critical industries focused business with the Industrial Division and SNA Europe, both experiencing strong double-digit growth, were especially encouraging.", "Within Industrial, an area that's on an upward trend, nearly all segments generated double-digit growth with natural resources, military and general industry leading the way. And SNA Europe's volume in the period was similarly positive again, reflecting gains across almost all geographies.", "So across the corporation, I'd characterize our markets as mixed, but on the whole, clearly positive. With overall strength in automotive repair, notwithstanding the outcome of our Tools Group and continuing strength in the critical industries and gains across geographies, despite the challenges of the quarter and headwinds will always exist.", "We remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth. And looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. We said this many times. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI driving, ongoing and significant advancements as they have for some time.", "Now for the full-year, sales of $3.69 billion represented an as-reported increase of 7.5%. The organic volume gain was 3.4%, with the RS&I Group up 7.6%, the C&I Group rising 4.5%, and the Tools Group roughly flat.", "As-reported EPS for the year was $9.52, but excluding the legal matters and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted reached $10.12, that's an increase of 10%.", "OpCo OI percent as-adjusted was 19.3%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points dilutive impact from acquisition and a decrease of 20 basis points associated with unfavorable currency.", "And when we include the income from Financial Services of $217.5 million, which rose $18.8 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation as-adjusted was 23.2%, up a similar 20 basis points, the quarter and the year, sales gains and profit increases, taking advantage of opportunities on our runways for growth and driving down our runways for improvement.", "Now, let's move to the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results. The Tools Group. Organic sales down 3% and operating earnings of $67.3 million, representing a margin rate of 16.4%, down 120 basis points. We do believe our actions to reinvigorate the van channel sales will be effective, but they didn't create improvement in the fourth quarter.", "In the quarter and throughout the year, however, the Tools Group did confirm the strength and the market-leading position of its van network. It wasn't evident in the recent financials, but it was clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. The franchisees are strong and the turnover is low and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice.", "And just this past quarter, Snap-on was ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee's satisfaction data. And in its latest ranking, lists as Snap-on as a Top 50 franchise, marking the 11th consecutive year we received that award based on satisfaction.", "We were also once again recognized by the Military Times, which includes Snap-on on its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five for the second year in a row and the only mobile tool franchise on the entire list.", "And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in the Elite Franchise magazine's Top UK franchises for 2018, finishing above many UK-only franchises and ahead of some very popular global brands.", "Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of the franchisees in our van business and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products. And in 2017, once again, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, those $1 million sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field that I think you've become familiar with.", "Tool Storage sales were still a shortfall in the quarter, but we're taking action. You heard me speak of migrating some premium options like the PowerDrawer, the speed organizer into our lower ranges, we're doing that. We're introducing new features and new themes. We're retooling the Rock N' Roll vans and we'll be expanding our line with a model that offers attractive capacity in a compact footprint, some high-end features at a price that's affordable to young technicians. A unit aimed at making them Snap-on customers for life and contributing to a restart for the Tools Group.", "And just in December, probably too late to affect the fourth quarter, we introduced our new series of 12-point high-performance ratcheting box wrenches, whole form gears, proprietary steel for durability, extended handle for leverage, 8-tooth pole to minimize the swing arc, another unique tool reducing technician job time, particularly in difficult and critical situations. The Tools Group may be below trends, but we keep building its strength with new product and network vitality, well that's the Tools Group.", "Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $356.8 million, with an organic rise of 6.2%. Double-digit sales gains in the OEM dealerships and low single-digit increases in diagnostics and repair information products. Operating earnings of $89.8 million, increased $7.3 million for an OI margin of 25.2%, down 60 basis points from last year, but with a 50 basis point decline from lower margin acquisitions and negative currency effects.", "Once again, we saw some compelling products, giving us more to sell to those repair shop owners and managers, offerings like the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini, our electronic logging device. It won a Professional Tool and Equipment Innovation of the Year Award at the SEMA show in Las Vegas. The Blue-Link Mini logs driver hours, vehicle movement, engine hours, vehicle performance data like, and vehicle performance data like speed and miles per gallon. All of that allows heavy-duty customers to meet the electronic data logging regulation that took effect in December. And it appears to be a winning product with great customer reception. We saw that.", "Our diagnostics and repair information businesses were also led by new products. We mentioned last quarter, the launch of our game-changing handheld intelligent diagnostics, the ZEUS. Well, it's selling well.", "Hardware and software subscriptions, yes, subscriptions, a new focus for one of our introductions. A great unit raising the bar in advanced repair, and helping to offset the difficult comparison of last year's fourth quarter, both in the launch of the MODIS Edge handheld and our very popular Thermal Imager in that category.", "RS&I also advanced in its position in the repair information space, the Mitchell 1 business, enhancing our ProDemand software by adding a new user interface. It takes repair information to a whole new level of intelligence with advanced search technology that scans the vast Mitchell 1 database and returns exactly the specific information the technician needs for that particular job.", "OEM data and Snap-on's proprietary SureTrack real-world data, real-world information is now more tightly integrated and the new interface amplifies the power of that combination. It makes the technician's diagnosis job easier, quicker and more accurate.", "Finally in the period, RS&I's equipment division introduced the new V2100 imaging wheel aligner. It's targeted squarely at meeting the needs of independent shops that work on a multiple brands of vehicles and perform a variety of repair services. Those shops typically can't have a dedicated alignment guy. They just don't do that many alignments. What they do need is an ease-of-use mid-tier unit. Different vehicle brands have varying alignment procedures. It's a major challenge for a general tech. Well, the V2100 is the right unit within an intuitive interface that will guide through the multiple approaches to align with clarity.", "For a general tech, it reduces alignment time by 30%, a great saving and a nice boost to our equipment lineup. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with the repair shop owners and managers, offering new products to sell, developed by our customer connection and innovation processes or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And you can see it in the numbers.", "Now, on to C&I. Sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by \u2013 I want to say that again \u2013 sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by $19.1 million in acquisition-related volume and $6.8 million of favorable currency.", "Organic sales were up 10.1%, among the highest we've ever seen at C&I. That year record increase reflects improvements from almost every operating division, including gains by Industrial, SNA Europe, Power Tools and the Asia-Pacific division. The group's operating income was $50.9 million. That's up from the $43.9 million reported last year. Operating income margin was 14.9%, down 40 basis points, but reflecting a 50 basis point impact from the acquisitions, dilutive acquisitions, and another 50 basis point decline from unfavorable currency. In fact, those impacts notwithstanding, 14.9% is among the highest margins we've seen for the group in the last several years, last four years or so. In effect, C&I had one of its strongest quarters.", "Reassuringly, SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up double-digits, continuing its progress, now 17 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth and profit climbed right along, up 19 straight quarters. 19 quarters in a row of profitability improvement, reflecting Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products and improved new processes, driving positive trends and some pretty challenging geographies.", "Also in C&I, our Industrial division made encouraging strides. As I mentioned before, strong double-digit growth, driven in part by our strong double-digit growth for our Industrial division, driven in part by a widening array of new products. Having been up and down in recent periods, aerospace showed good progress in the quarter, rising worldwide.", "First time in a while, we vision both in domestic and international on a boost from customer connection, authoring products like our new cordless grease gun kit. Many planes have service requirements, which prohibit them from using this industry standard units with customer connection Snap-on developed a new gun, which limits the grease delivery pressure, matching a special aircraft requirements.", "And based on further customer connection, we also added improvements like an extended length pressure hose, giving technicians that added reach to reach and service landing gear and a clear grease cartridge tube, allowing users to quickly identify the type of material in the gun. Now these are, seem like simple improvements and they are, but they're quite effective in making critical work easier in special aerospace situations.", "Just like in the Industrial division, SNA Europe has also been using customer connection and innovation to drive its continuing expansion. For example, in the critical power generation industry in Europe, with a significant amount of oil in Northern Europe being pumped from offshore, there was opportunity for a special tool kit for servicing the individual ocean rigs.", "Customer connection, observing the environment and tasks led to the development of what we're calling the pump-man tool kit, combining bottles tools at height with safe when you use them at height with the safety suspenders and with our large array of \u2013 combining those tools at height with a large array of our non-sparking tools, eliminating fire hazards and addressing the service and safety needs for the critical oil rig environment. The specialized kits \u2013 these specialized pump-man kits were released just this year, but based on early receptions, we believe will be a big driver for our expansion in the oil and gas industry and a great help in continuing SNA Europe's upward trajectory.", "Power Tools division returned to growth in the quarter and new product paved the way. One winner was our new CDRR761, a 14.4 volt, 3/8 inches, MicroLithium right-angle drill, lightweight, provides up to 150-inch pounds of torque, offers two-speed ranges at a variable speed switch. It's great for driving screws with control.", "It was launched to help technicians get into small tight spaces under \u2013 like under the dash and on the firewall and it has an integrated LED light to illuminate that dark work. It was introduced in the fourth quarter and it's already $1 million seller, one of our hit products that drive growth.", "Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales rising 4.3%. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement.", "Tools Group, working on regaining growth. RS&I continuing its considerable strength and C&I starting to show its potential with much more to go. All of it driving a 19.4% adjusted operating margin, despite the dilutive acquisition and an as-adjusted EPS of $2.69, up 8.9%. That's our fourth quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $974.6 million in the quarter increased 9.5%, reflecting a 4.3% organic sales gains, $29.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation.", "The year-over-year organic sales growth, which was the highest level achieved of any quarter in 2017, reflects ongoing progress in serving repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle repair sector as well as broad-based growth in the businesses that comprise the Commercial & Industrial segment.", "Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% declined 220 basis points, primarily due to higher sales of lower gross margin products, 60 basis points of lower gross margins on an acquisition-related sales and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.", "The operating expense margin of 31.5% increased 140 basis points as 320 basis points related to the legal charge that, as Nick has mentioned, is being appealed. These were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage and a 40 basis point benefit from operating expenses for acquisitions.", "Operating earnings before Financial Services of $157.7 million or 16.2% of sales, includes the legal charge and compares to $176.1 million or 19.8% of sales in the prior year. Excluding the legal charge, operating earnings before Financial Services, as-adjusted was $188.6 million or 19.4% of sales. Financial Services revenue of $79.9 million and operating earnings of $54.4 million increased $5.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively from 2016.", "Consolidated operating earnings of $212.1 million or 20.1% of revenues compared to $227.7 million or 23.6% of revenues a year ago. Excluding the legal charge, consolidated operating earnings as-adjusted was $243.0 million or 23.0% of revenues.", "Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 33.0% was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge, but increased by 360 basis points as a result of a $7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the United States.", "This tax charge includes an estimated transition tax, an unremitted foreign earnings of $13.7 million, partially offset by an estimated tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $6.7 million. Excluding both the legal and tax charges, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as-adjusted was 30.6% as compared to 30.8% in Q4 of 2016.", "Finally, net earnings of $129.5 million or $2.24 per diluted share compared to $146.3 million or $2.47 per share a year ago. Excluding the legal charge and tax charge, net earnings as-adjusted was $155.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.69, represented an increase of 8.9%.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $341.7 million in the quarter increased 19.4%, reflecting a 10.1% organic sales gain, $19.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation.", "The organic sales increase includes double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in European-based hand tools business as well as low single-digit gains in both the segments Power Tools and Asia-Pacific operations. The gains in critical industries were positive across the board, including strong growth in international aviation and the military, two areas, which were weaker earlier in the year.", "Gross margin of 39.2% declined 110 basis points from 40.3% a year ago due to higher sales of lower gross margin products and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 24.3% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits of sales volume leverage, partially offset by 50 basis points of operating expenses related to our acquisitions.", "Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.9 million increased 15.9% and the operating margin of 14.9% compared to 15.3% a year ago, including the 100 basis point impact from currency and acquisitions mentioned above.", "Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Tools Group of $409.2 million decreased 2%, reflecting a 3% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid-single digit decline in the U.S., which was only partially offset by a mid-single digit sales gain internationally.", "Gross margin of 41.4% decreased 60 basis points year-over-year due to the lower volume in related cost. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $67.3 million, decreased 8.4% and the operating margin of 16.4% compared to 17.6% in 2016.", "Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $356.8 million increased 11.6%, reflecting a 6.2% organic sales gain, $10.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflected a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products.", "Gross margin of 45.4% declined 240 basis points as a 110 basis point impact from acquisitions, higher sales of lower gross margin products and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 20.2% improved 180 basis points due to the higher sales volume and 80 basis points of benefits from acquisitions, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency.", "Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $89.8 million increased 8.8% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.2% compared to 25.8% last year, including a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions.", "Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $54.4 million on revenue of $79.9 million compared to operating earnings of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million a year ago.", "Financial Services expenses of $25.5 million increased $2.9 million, primarily due to a $2.4 million year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled $16.0 million in the quarter. This is up $3.2 million sequentially from $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and compares to third to fourth quarter sequential increase in the prior year of $2.8 million.", "As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.3% in both the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% in 2017, compared to 18.2% in 2016 due in part to the portfolio mix as well as higher percentage of originations utilizing marketing rebates in 2017. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.3%.", "Total loan originations of $265 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.7 million or 1.8% year-over-year. As higher originations of contract receivables principally franchise finance were partially offset by a decline in finance receivable originations due to the lower year-over-year sales of big-ticket items in the U.S. by the Snap-on Tools Group.", "Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.74 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio grew $28.1 million or 1.4% in the fourth quarter.", "As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, they are, as expected, tracking higher year-over-year, similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters and also reflecting typical seasonal increases. We believe these, trends however, continue to support our view over an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business.", "As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12- month losses of $46.7 million, represented 2.92% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 61 basis points year-over-year and 15 basis points sequentially.", "The 60-plus day delinquency rate of 1.9% for U.S. extended credit increased 20 basis points sequentially typical of the seasonal increase from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Overall, operating earnings in the Financial Services segment rose 5.4% year-over-year. Their allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the above-mentioned trends in the portfolio's performance.", "Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.5 million in the quarter increased $41.8 million from comparable 2016 levels, due primarily to lower discretionary pension contributions and cash paid for income taxes in 2017. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.0 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million, down from $53.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Capital expenditures of $24.7 million in the quarter compared with $17.7 million last year. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.6 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $46.4 million and the repurchase of 472,000 shares of common stock for $75.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full-year 2017 share repurchases totaled 1.82 million shares for $287.9 million.", "Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $76.8 million from 2016 year-end levels, primarily due to higher sales, $21.7 million of foreign currency translation and $9.5 million from acquisitions. Days sales outstanding of 66 days was up from 63 days a year ago, but down from 67 days at the end of the third quarter.", "Inventories increased $108.3 million from 2016 year-end, primarily to support increased customer demand in certain segments and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation and acquisitions contributed $23.9 million and $5.7 million of the increase, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.2 compared to 3.3 at year-end 2016. Inventories decreased approximately $11 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Our year-end cash position of $92 million increased $14.4 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased to 27.0% from 26.3% year-over-year. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $151 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.", "That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2018. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. As a result of the recently enacted tax legislation in the United States, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2018 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 24% to 25%. This compares to a full-year 2017 effective tax rate on a reported and on an adjusted basis of 31.1% and 30.6%, respectively.", "I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Aldo. Well, I started by saying that we were encouraged but unsatisfied in the quarter and we were. The Tools Group remain below trend, not yet recovering, but we continue to have confidence in the market and in our inherent strengths. We do have a strong franchise network. The turnover and our franchisee health metrics say so.", "And we are investing in new products and support to restart the growth engine. You can see it in the ZEUS, revolutionizing vehicle diagnostics and moving us further into subscription-based software. But despite the Tools Group challenges, we overcame again. Organic sales growth was 4.3% and the as-reported number was 9.5%.", "The RS&I Group and the C&I Group both had strong quarters. RS&I as-reported growth, 11.6% organic and inorganic gain of 6.2% and OI margin 25.2%, a significant contribution to our performance.", "C&I had a near-record quarter, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage with success. As-reported sales of 19.4% and an organic increase at 10.1%, OI margin of 14.9% among the group's highest.", "The results in the quarter I think clearly demonstrate that our coherent runways for growth, expanding with repair shop owners and managers and extending to critical industries are wide with abundant opportunities, and we're confident we have the strength and the position all along our runways for further growth \u2013 all along our runways. We have the strength and position for further growth and more improvement amplified by the new tax rates to maintain our positive performance trajectory as we move through 2018 and beyond.", "Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. The performance of our fourth quarter and of the year and our clear opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contributions. For your ongoing achievements, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing dedication and commitment to our team, you have my thanks.", "Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR.", "Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "Yes, thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Hey, Liam.", "Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "Nick, in the core Snap-on Tools Group, you highlighted the fact that storage sales were down again. But how did the core hand tool business fare this quarter on the year-over-year basis?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Well, the hand tool business was I think improved from the fourth quarter, but it's still down some. And we're still suffering I think the results of maybe the less than overwhelming offerings, coming out of the SFC. So, we're seeing an improvement, but not where we want it to be. The big factor, the good news in the quarter I think is associated with the ZEUS, the effect of the ZEUS and its sale off the vans, which is very encouraging for us. That's the silver lining in the quarter, I think. But in general, we still got to keep working on the Tools Group, new product, new support.", "Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "Okay. And on a free cash flow basis, Aldo, you're up about 35%. Does that change your capital allocation outlook? You went through a good part of your buyback authorization. Does that become an increasing part of your capital allocation strategy?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Certainly. The share repurchase is part of our allocation strategy, but I think our priorities remain the same, Liam. We have good access to capital markets, the new tax action provide more cash generation opportunities, but serving organic sales and then M&A opportunities still becomes the two most important items on the list, but certainly share repurchase, dividend strategy, pension contributions factor into that decision as well.", "Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.", "Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks, Liam.", "Operator", "Next is David MacGregor at Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning. Do you hear me okay?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Great. A couple of questions. First of all, just on the C&I, pretty remarkable organic growth. It's nice to see you follow \u2013 sort of firing on all the cylinders. I guess the question is just how sustainable is it? And just talk about \u2013 I know you don't provide quantitative outlook and guidance on your head, but if you could just talk about how sustainable that organic growth might be, given the strength you're seeing in critical industries and European hand tools?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Look, I think you can look at it this way. I believe that SNA Europe was up double-digits and you might not say double-digit every quarter, but I think we said in our thing, it's been up 17 quarters in a row in terms of sales; and 19 quarters in a row in terms of profit. And we think it's still got considerable headroom. It's still not back to where it was prerecession. So it took a big dip in a recession and we keep making it stronger, so we're positive about SNA Europe and I think we have abundant demonstration of that.", "The Industrial business is now through the downturn in the industrial sector in oil and gas and others. We kept investing in new product and our understanding of marketplace and I think you're seeing that come to fruition.", "Now I'm not going to say until you see those two big cylinders, I think working, based on improved capabilities that you can see coming through in the results to us. Now whether that's going to offer double-digit growth or not, is another question. I think we prefer to say that we look at our growth on an organic basis at 4% to 6% and we see C&I at the top end of that, but it appears as though in this environment with the strength we have, we got two big pistons there.", "And the other place, Asia-Pacific, had pretty good growth particularly in China and in India, in turbulent markets, I would say. And Power Tools came back, so I think you'd say C&I has positioned pretty well and the numbers showing that. If you take a look at those numbers, this is what we meant by rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Well, congratulations on all the progress there. I guess my second question was on the Tools segment and just if you could talk about franchisee order patterns through the quarter and what was changing there. I know your contract receivables are up, and you talked about that being driven by franchisee sales. Is your sense that inventories are maybe up a little, accumulating within the franchise network?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Actually no. I don't think the inventories are accumulated.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "The contract receivables, David, are up principally because of the launch of new vans and the franchised channel, so a lot of franchisees have upped the size of their advance they're putting on the street, and that's one of the key drivers in franchise finance.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "We would say the opposite actually that, if anything that we don't have perfect visibility on this. If anything, the franchisees inventories are coming down a little bit.", "I think the principal component of the franchisee story is the ZEUS. The ZEUS is selling well off the van and I don't know if the import of my remarks hits, but the franchisees are selling this big revolutionary new ZEUS at higher levels than we've seen for a large unit and they are selling what we call a data package, which is three years of subscriptions. We never really sold subscriptions with a launch before, and that's happening at record level.", "So I think if you look at the franchise interface level, one of the real great stories is around that revolutionary diagnostic, which is changing the industry, recognizes the market leader and is pulling us more into subscriptions-based software.", "Now when you do this kind of thing, it doesn't always register for the Tools Group right away, because the franchisees sell for three year subscription boom and it gets financed or sold in other way. And we, in the Tools Group, recognize on an amortized basis over the month. So they see that kind of thing, but if you look at that level, the franchisees are pretty happy about this.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "And last question for me is just on the Tools business. You talked about the gross margin pressure there and I appreciate you breaking it out for us. To what extent, this promotional pressure or promotional programs sort of a headwind on gross margins, and if you could tie that in with just some commentary around the general competitive environment tools that would be helpful?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I'll say it this way. Look, I'll say it this way. Look, the Tools Group volume is down. They're vertically integrated, so you know that's going to play out in some kind of loss margin plus absorption and that kind of situation; but also, they want volume. If you're in the position of the Tools Group, if you want volume and so they're working pretty hard to take advantage of every possible piece of daylight they can. That's not the most efficient way to sell.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Good morning Gary.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Nick, on the Tool Storage area, I mean, how far are you on the product refresh that I think you \u2013 we had talked about couple of quarter \u2013 over the last couple of quarters, then you mentioned it a little in your earlier comments. I mean are you basically done with that product refresh?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I ain't done at all. I'm not done, but we were \u2013 we brought out some stuff. I think I said in the \u2013 some different themes and some different features and we migrated some features down into smaller \u2013 into the \u2013 some of the middle \u2013 mid-tier line, and we're continuing to do that. And I think we continue to make changes associated with the Tool Storage, because we think it didn't move \u2013 what happens to it, Gary, it didn't move this quarter. Some of that stuff worked, but not enough to move the overall needle, so you keep bringing out new stuff to try to make sure you can make the change.", "I think one of the things we're kind of encouraged about is this entry-level thing for the technicians, which we're kind of focused on in this situation. We're kind of \u2013 we're seeing some reasonable effects at the top end of the line and then \u2013 so we'd like to get these guys to \u2013 at the lower end with a little more activity. So you're seeing some of that.", "Then you go back to the Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Rock N' Roll Cabs, we're refurbishing them and we finished the first half of that refurbishment program right at the end of the year, so they really weren't \u2013 if you look at it, they really weren't on the road. And we expect to get the other half finished in another quarter, let's say, for government work. So you'll see those rolling out.", "So I don't \u2013 if you're looking for me to tell you when the thing is going to turn around, I guess I can't, but I have every confidence we can do this. And the reason I do this is because, when you look at our van network, you talk to our franchisees, you see our product line, pretty strong.", "Now we have gaps and it's caused us some difficulty, but the Tools Group, each one of our groups go up and down like this and we bring them back. I think the thing about the quarter is, is for the second quarter in a row, the Tools Group had difficulty and we achieved anyway because we had great quarters with RS&I and C&I.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "No, no. I understand and get it. No, I'm just trying to try and get an idea of when we could see an inflection point in the Tools Group?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, I think, I said, the meaning of my word unsatisfied is this, Gary. We expect to grow every quarter.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "And so, we don't grow in one of these divisions, while there is the possibility of having a difficult quarter, we're not satisfied. So our expectation would be to grow, but I can't \u2013 in terms of forecasting for a financial situation, I can't be saying that we're doing that, but I can tell you internally, we're looking for it.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "And then what \u2013 in terms of refurbishing the van, the Rock N' Roll, vans, cabs.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "What are you doing there?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "First of all, you start from the outside in. You make the outside look differently, you do different wraps. You go inside, you reorganize the structure of the vans themselves, you put new stuff on, you organize a more robust refreshment of the Tool Storage boxes on the van, you try to make sure you have different examples, and we install a new computer system, which will \u2013 a new 3D modeling system, which if you doesn't see it on the van, or you see it on the van and you like a different color, you get a great picture of it.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "So, we do those kinds of things. It's really to try to make it seem different, so when the technician gets on the van, he says, oh, this is different I want to take a look at this stuff.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then getting back to the ZEUS, which is interesting.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Is this a federal \u2013 what is it, a federal regulation now that you have to monitor your mileage or something?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "No, no, no. Sorry, I probably confused you on this. The ZEUS, I was talking about the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini. It's an electronic data logging. That's in the heavy-duty business that you put on trucks that monitor the daily log. There was legislation that took place that took effect in December, which drove that sales. ZEUS is for, your average vehicles in your \u2013 in Bimmer's auto repair, down in Illinois or something like that, or a muffler shop.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Sure.", "Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next to David Leiker with Baird.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Hello.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "I was hoping to peel back the onion a bit more on the Tools Group. So if I look at finance receivable originations, and that's my proxy for big-ticket product sales, that was down 1% to get to Tools Group of down 3%, it means the core hand tool, power tool business, let's call it, was down 4% and that down 4% is a weaker number than it's been tracking all year long.", "So I'm just wondering within Q4, what trends did you see that might explain maybe a weakening or I'm wondering since we're talking about the ZEUS, are your franchisees spending more time selling ZEUS and maybe less time selling Tools and that might be getting caught up in this number?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Let's just talk about this for a minute. As you know, I know you know this well. There isn't a perfect linkage between the Tools Group sales and originations. One thing, there is a time lag, probably the stuff that's originated in the fourth quarter, some significant portion of that got sold by us in the third quarter, that's one thing, I think. Clear, you know this. The work that gets into the van, they got to sell it and so on. That's one thing.", "And ZEUS introduced a new wrinkle for this. ZEUS is two pieces. It is the hardware itself, revolutionizing, intelligent diagnostics, faster stream, better color resolution, all that stuff and then it's a software package, a data software package underneath the intelligent diagnostic.", "Well, the data software package sells for thousands of dollars because it's three years and that gets financed, but it doesn't get recognized at the Tools Group, except on a monthly basis, amortized like a subscription. So not only is there \u2013 is this new wrinkle introduced by ZEUS, and that you have franchisees financing something, which doesn't really get recognized as immediately by a sale, by the Tools Group because it's the subscription-based software. We think it's a great situation because we're going to subscription base, that creates some of that disconnect. And so, I think you could talk to us a little more extensively and we can talk about this a little bit more and go through it, that's number one.", "Number two is your point is well taken though, I think. The ZEUS is a very expensive unit and we do have to take a lot of effort in training the franchisees and having our diagnostics, our 130 diagnostic systems developers and the Techno van supporting them and it takes a lot of effort to sell it. So a successful ZEUS sale can be drawing attention from other things, that's true. It's hard to quantify that though, Joe, you know. But that does happen.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. The point on software sales, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe if I spin the question around a little bit. So, U.S. down mid single-digits. That was a consistent number as in Q3. Obviously, tool storage has been weak. We've talked about that, but in thinking about the core mechanic customer, what is your sense on just the backdrop there whether the BLS has data, it shows hours worked up, hiring up, earnings way up. It would seems like that customer is able to buy more tools. What is your sense on Snap-on's ability to tap into what is ultimately a pretty strong, I'll call it, wallet growth?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I agree. That's why I'm saying the automotive repair market is a robust market with abundant opportunity that we can drive down. We think we have the capability to do it. I mean, I think the fact that we're selling the ZEUSs in pretty good numbers, basically last year, we had a boffo quarter with the thermal imager. You know what, we sold a lot of them in the fourth quarter and at the franchisee level, they're overcoming that with ZEUS. And so what you got is people are playing the ZEUS list price, some people have looked at it, all-in is like $17,000. Now that's like a car price. There's a lot of versions of that, that gets sold, but it's thousands of dollars, and we're selling it successfully. So we're able to tap into it I think if we have the right product.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And you think recent, you've talked about coming out of the franchise conference, that product introduction, but have there been other items launched in the back half of the year? We're entering Q1 or we're over a month into Q1, what have been more recent trends than just that undertaking around new products?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "That's why I put the power tool in the script. The power tool that we talked about, that 3/8 inch mini power tool right angle drill sold out right away and it became a $1 million seller, a hit product. So we are launching products. Our problem is, we're not selling enough tool storage, and there are other issues, but the thing is that, we need to turn around tool storage. That's what I think. Now there are other things we'd like to see go better. So we are seeing encouraging. When we have the product, we believe we sell it.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And then my last question, A lot of our focus over the past year has been on finance receivables, but let's maybe talk about contract receivables. How much of the asset book is that category? And then can you just segment of contract receivables, how much is maybe more of a commercial loan with the shop? How much is going to be van leases? And are the growth in van leases going on right now? Is that historically a leading indicator of future activity or anything you can kind of foot to for why franchisees are reinvesting right now?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "Joe, actually, there's not a lot to be gleaned. The mix within the portfolio has been rather constant. If you look at the end of Q4, 81% of the portfolio is extended credit, 15% is franchise finance and 3% is to leases of equipment to shop owners. That vacillates between 3% and 4% over the years. The franchise finance goes from 13.5% to 15.5%, so it's kind of all within range. I think it's a sign of prosperity and confidence when you see the franchisees up into a new van, particularly a larger van. I think they wouldn't make an investment like that if they didn't show their commitment to the future and want to keep growing their business.", "Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. I think last year, maybe a couple of phases you tightened credit a little bit. Just wondering what the results, learnings were around that, what the latest toggles are if that subsequently yielded to some opportunity to lose some credit backup perhaps?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "I think we look at credit each and every quarter, a little bit harder at certain times of the year than others, Chris. It evolves, but not big movements in terms of decision making, we're always trying to tweak the portfolio in a positive way, try to put our franchisees and ourselves in a better place. Try to make sure we match our customers' needs up with what we were offering. So loosening credit, I wouldn't say that per se. I think we're judicious in terms of how we counsel the franchisees and approaching the situation. Having said that, one of the callers earlier made the comment that I think mechanics' wallets are getting bigger. I think that means that there probably is more capacity over time. We were trying to identify where that credit capacity is and loan to those mechanics.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then on the core vans channel, wondering if you're seeing any apparent rebalancing in the vans channel marketplace around historical price spreads around the few key competitors and maybe any changes on the relative under-penetration of some of your stronger peers?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Look, certainly if you looked at our numbers and you looked at some of the other numbers, you would conclude there's some change. We don't hear it from our franchisees. We don't hear them saying, oh, by the way, I have trouble competing with this guy or that guy over a particular product. So to the extent other people are growing, I guess you could argue that they're making inroads, where we could have had those inroads, but, or had that business. But you don't hear at the level. Nobody comes up and says, boy, you got to match this or we got to do this, or this is giving me problems. You don't hear it.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then just final, bookkeeping, if you told us I missed it, but what's the finance receivables allowance balance down the year?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "The balance is about 3% of the portfolio, if you look at the coverage ratio.", "Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Okay.", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "A little bit more.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "If we move to the next question please.", "Operator", "Pardon me. Thank you. We'll go next to Scott Stember with C.L. King.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Good morning, guys.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question. Nick, you had referred to the SFC, and I guess you're referring to the big pack of tools and maybe some bundling or unbundling that didn't go well, I guess from a pricing and just the actual packaging. Could you talk about what you've done to remedy that? And how long would we take to see that with an improved numbers within the Tools Group? Thank you very much.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Look, I think, yeah, the thing is that generally hand tools are something which are a little different than tool storage or diagnostics or anything else. The hand tools inventory is fairly ubiquitous on the van itself. They have a lot of handles, but generally, they have to be \u2013 you have to attract them to a bundle. It didn't work so well, some people took it in the SFC. We've tried to counter that by bringing out some tools, that's why I talked some individual tools that would be attractive.", "So, when I talked about the ratcheting wrenches and the specific high-durability ratcheting wrench that gets into certain small spaces, that's the kind of thing we're doing. And remember, I could have talked for the whole call about those kinds of things and so that's what we're trying to do to try to restart that. I think if you're dangerous, if you're looking at any one quarter at any particular group, because you do even in the good \u2013 when they were growing like a 7%, you saw ups and downs in those things so you can't necessarily conclude that hand tools because it's up and down, would be in trouble in terms of a tool category or be wanting in any way, we just didn't quite have the right package and we're trying to restart that with new product.", "Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.", "Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Are you seeing any kind of a market share struggle, I guess. I mean, the question was kind of asked earlier. I have heard from mechanics and some of your other franchise peers are being aggressive on pricing at the shop level. And is that something that you're hearing at all from your franchisees?", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "You know from the \u2013 Bret, from the 80,000 foot level, you would say, we must be seeing something like that, if other people are growing faster than you are. I don't know if the mechanisms for that competition are price or what, but when I ride and I was just on a van the other day and guy never mentioned Mac or Matco, or any other competition.", "Now of course, he is talking to me and you can argue this, but I do meet with these guys a lot and often, they're just talking about ourselves, we could have \u2013 we could use different tool storage. We could use a new model in tool storage to address this kind of thing. We like the ZEUS. It takes \u2013 we're enthusiastic about the ZEUS. The feedback I get is all associated with ourselves. So I don't think we're feeling something that other people are doing other than maybe we're not doing as well as we could do versus what we expect of ourselves, that's the difference, I think. Really.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "I think the Snap-on franchise \u2013 you ask people about the preferred form of hand tool, that seems rock solid.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then a housekeeping. On rates, would you expect and I guess the rates were down and maybe I think Aldo mentioned some promotional issues on the quarter on the funding rate, but would you expect rate to be up going forward just given the increasing rate environment? Or do you think we're still sort of \u2013 we're going to be kind of flat?", "Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.", "I think they stay, Bret. It wasn't by a couple promotions. The products that fascinated the customer is what we call featured products. Featured products usually have rebates associated with them. That marketing expense comes off of the interest income that we calculate and the uptake on those was just better than what it had been in Q4 of last year. So you get a little bit of a depressant effect.", "And then the mix in the portfolio tend to be a little bit better quality credit and a lot of the shop owners with the ZEUS that Nick mentioned, the principal buyers of that are pretty good credit quality customers that drives the rate in the portfolio down a bit. So it depends on the mix of those. To answer your question, I think it stays in the 17% to 18% range on a holistic basis for finance receivables.", "Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciated it.", "Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any closing remarks.", "Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.", "Thanks for joining us today.
